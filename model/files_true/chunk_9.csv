Trump gets back on message at first rally after debate,"MELBOURNE, Fla. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump got back on message on Tuesday after Democrat Hillary Clinton put him on the defensive at their first debate, and he cast her as stuck in the past and himself as a change agent. Trumps speech to thousands at a rally in a Florida airport hangar included some points that some supporters wished he had made before the record television audience of 84 million people for the debate on Monday in Hempstead, New York. One was Clintons promise during her successful campaign to win a U.S. Senate seat in 2000 to create jobs in upstate New York. When Clinton pledged at Mondays debate that her economic plan would create millions of jobs, Trump did not use the opportunity to point out she oversold how many jobs she could create in upstate New York. Trump raised the issue on Tuesday in Melbourne, Florida,  about 70 miles east of Orlando on Floridas Atlantic coast where several defense and technology companies have operations. She pledged 200,000 jobs for upstate New York. Its so sad when you see what has happened to upstate New York. Its a disaster. She said she was going to do something about it... This is exactly what would happen if she ever won, he said. Trumps first campaign day after his debate performance, which received mixed reviews from voters, was aimed at taking advantage of polls showing him in a tight race in Florida with 41 days to go until the Nov. 8 election. For 90 minutes, Secretary Clinton was stuck in the past. For 90 minutes, on issue after issue, Secretary Clinton defended the terrible status quo  while I laid out our plan to bring jobs, security and prosperity back to the American people, he said. Earlier, at a Cuban bakery in Miamis Little Havana area, Trump sipped coffee and ordered pastries and empanadas and heard cries of Viva Trump from some patrons there.  Elsewhere in the neighborhood, Trump held a roundtable discussion with Latino supporters, an effort to bolster his support among Hispanic-American voters who worry about his hardline immigration policy. At that event, a Trump supporter, Irina Vilarino, a Cuban-American restaurant owner, told reporters that Trump needs to show improvement at his next debate on Oct. 9 in St. Louis. He needs to take this debate and learn from his mistakes, she said. And I think he needs to address the issues that are pertinent to everyday Americans on the street.

"Obama names U.S. ambassador to Cuba, setting up confirmation fight","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Tuesday nominated career diplomat Jeffrey DeLaurentis to be the first U.S. ambassador to Cuba in more than five decades, setting up a fierce confirmation battle with Republicans in Congress opposed to Obamas opening with the communist-ruled island. The appointment of DeLaurentis, the top American official at the U.S. embassy in Havana since relations were restored last year, marked Obamas latest move to go as far as he can in normalizing ties between the former Cold War foes before he leaves office in January. The nomination must be approved by the Republican-controlled Senate, which is seen as a long shot, especially in a presidential election year and given expected strong resistance from Cuban-American senators including Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas. Rubio, in a blistering statement, derided the nomination as a last-ditch legacy project by Obama and said it should go nowhere. An individual senator has the power - one that is often invoked - to put a hold on an ambassadorial nomination to delay a full Senate vote. In a veiled appeal to lawmakers, Obama praised DeLaurentis for his leadership during the normalization process. We only hurt ourselves by not being represented by an ambassador in Havana, he said in a statement. Having an ambassador will make it easier to advocate for our interests and will deepen our understanding even when we know that we will continue to have differences with the Cuban government, Obama said. DeLaurentis had been widely tipped for the post. But the president held off naming him until now even as Cuba appointed its own ambassador to Washington shortly after embassies were reopened in both countries capitals in July of last year. He would be the first U.S. envoy since Philip Bonsal, an appointee of President Dwight Eisenhower, left the post vacant in late 1960. Obama traveled to Havana in March, the first visit by a U.S. president in 88 years. The trip was made possible by his breakthrough agreement with Cuban President Raul Castro in December 2014 to cast aside decades of hostility that began soon after Cubas 1959 revolution. Since the opening, Obama has repeatedly used his executive powers to relax trade and travel restrictions, while pushing Cuba to accelerate cautious market-style reforms and allow greater political and economic freedom. Even so, the U.S. embargo against Cuba remains in place, a major irritant in relations. Only Congress can lift the embargo, and the Republican leadership is not expected to allow such a move anytime soon. DeLaurentis has been U.S. chief of mission in Cuba since August 2014, his third posting in Havana. He has also held diplomatic posts at the State Department in Washington, at the U.S. mission to the United Nations and in Bogota. ",politicsNews,"September 27, 2016 ",1
Obama power plant rules face key test in court,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The centerpiece of President Barack Obamas climate change strategy faced a key test on Tuesday as conservative appeals court judges questioned whether his administration overstepped its legal authority under an air pollution law to make sweeping changes to the U.S. electric sector. Twenty-seven states led by coal-producer West Virginia and industry groups are challenging the Environmental Protection Agencys Clean Power Plan rules before 10 judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They argue that the EPA overstepped its regulatory authority under the federal Clean Air Act when the agency issued rules to curb greenhouse emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants. The U.S. Supreme Court has put the regulations on hold while the case is litigated. Tuesdays highly anticipated arguments drew a crowd of hundreds at sunrise to watch the opponents face off against the EPA, 18 states and some supportive power companies. The EPA told the judges that the agency had the power under the Clean Air Act to craft the rule, and that it was cost-effective and achievable. The challengers could face an uphill battle to win over a majority of the 10 judges, six of whom are Democratic appointees.  Judge Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by former President George W. Bush, said while he understands the political and moral obligation to address global warming and the importance of the United States to international climate action, the Clean Power Plans impact on the U.S. economy and on certain coal-reliant communities should require Congress to have a say. This is a huge case. It has huge economic consequences, said Kavanaugh. He added that climate change does not give the EPA a blank check to use the Clean Air Act flexibly.  Judge Thomas Griffith, another Bush appointee, questioned: Why is this (debate) not going-on on the Congress floor but in front of a room full of unelected judges?   The EPA argued before that the Supreme Court has already given the EPA authority in previous cases to use the section of the Clean Air Act at issue to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Justice Department lawyer Eric Hostetler, representing the EPA, said the agency designed the rule to be cost effective and deepen the shift already taking place toward cleaner energy. The EPA looked at what was going on in the real world, he said, noting that most states are already shifting the make-up of their electric generation.     In comments indicating support for the governments position, Judge Judith Rogers, appointed to the court by former President Bill Clinton, said the EPA should not close its eyes to trends in the electric sector which have seen utilities diversify their energy mix. You cant survive in this market unless you do that, she said. Some of the other Democratic appointees voiced similar sentiments indicating they did not think the regulations constituted a major shift as the challengers argue. The Clean Power Plan was designed to lower carbon emissions from U.S. power plants by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels. Power plants are the largest source of U.S. carbon emissions.   The Clean Power Plan is the main tool for the United States to meet the emissions reduction target it pledged to reach at U.N. climate talks in Paris last December.  The fate of the Clean Power Plan was thrown into question on Feb. 9 when the Supreme Court made a surprise 5-4 decision to grant a request by the challengers to put the rule on hold while the appeals court considered the matter. The eventual appeals court ruling could decide the case, even if it goes to the Supreme Court. The Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia left the court ideologically split with four conservatives and four liberals. A 4-4 ruling by the high court would leave in place the appeals court ruling. The case is being heard by 10 judges rather than 11 because the courts chief judge, Merrick Garland, has recused himself from the case. Garland is Obamas nominee to replace Scalia.  A 5-5 ruling would leave the regulations in place.  A ruling is unlikely before the end of the year and possibly not until after Obama leaves office on Jan. 20.  The outcome of the Nov. 8 presidential election could be pivotal for the regulations. If Republican Donald Trump wins, the government could reverse the rules or decline to appeal to the Supreme Court should the appeals court strike them down. If Democrat Hillary Clinton is elected, the losing side in the appeals court ruling could be expected to take the case to the Supreme Court. If the case does reach the high court, it may not make it in time for the justices to hear it during the court term that begins next Monday and ends in June. ",politicsNews,"September 27, 2016 ",1
Senate bill would count munis toward bank liquidity,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Bonds sold by U.S. states, cities, schools and other issuers in the municipal market could be held as liquid assets by banks under legislation introduced on Tuesday in the U.S. Senate, bolstering the case for purchasing the debt while helping financial institutions weather market crises. The bipartisan measure would classify high-quality municipal bonds at the same level as corporate debt, allowing banks to use munis to comply with new 30-day federal liquidity requirements. Federal rules approved in 2014 and effective next year are aimed at ensuring big banks will be able to access sufficient cash during a financial crisis. But the rules excluded muni bonds from the types of securities that count as high quality liquid assets, or HQLAs.  Muni debt issuers fear the exclusion would deter banks from buying muni debt, hurting their ability to fund everything from schools and bridges to water treatment plants and hospitals. If banks retreat from the muni-bond market, it could choke off a critical source of investment on which our cities and localities rely. This bill protects the stability of our markets while providing continued access to muni bonds for local governments, Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a statement.  Schumer, along with Senators Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, and Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, led a group sponsoring the legislation. Putting munis on par with corporate debt would be acceptable, according to Washington State Treasurer James McIntire, president of the National Association of State Treasurers (NAST), which has been pushing for the inclusion of munis under the rules.  A House bill would also allow banks to count munis toward banks liquidity but at a higher face value, 85 percent, versus 50 percent in the Senate bill, according to NAST.

Kansas judge extends voting rights for those registered at motor vehicle offices,"(Reuters) - A Kansas judge extended voting rights through the Nov. 8 election of about 17,500 people who registered to vote at motor vehicle offices, court documents showed on Tuesday in one of the cases highlighting a political battle over identification laws enacted in Republican-led states. The ruling impacts people who submitted voter applications through Kansas motor vehicle offices but failed to provide proof of U.S. citizenship. The ruling by Judge Larry Hendricks of the third judicial court in Shawnee, Kansas, extends the temporary injunction he issued last month.  Under a state law that took effect in 2013, they were required to present a document such as a birth certificate. The judges ruling made on Friday said that the Kansas Secretary of State, Kris Kobach, must instruct election officials to allow the around 17,500 residents to ...vote for all offices on the ballot and to count all the votes cast on that ballot. Kobach, a Republican who has become a national leader in pushing for anti-immigration and voting changes, said on Tuesday that his office would continue with the case. Hendricks has not made a final ruling.    The state will proceed with discovery as directed by the court.As is normal, the temporary injunction remains in place until a final order is issued by Judge Hendricks, Kobach said in a statement. Kansas law is one of the strictest voter identification statutes in the country, making the state a symbol for mostly Republican Party supporters who say the rules are meant to prevent voter fraud. Opponents, mostly Democrats, say they discriminate against minorities. The American Civil Liberties Union has argued that the statute conflicts with a federal law designed to make it easier to register to vote while getting a drivers license.  Kobach asked the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to place on hold a decision in May by a lower-court judge ordering the state to begin registering the roughly 17,500 residents affected by the law. [nL1N19301N]  In requesting the stay, the state said the order to begin to register voters would result in extraordinary confusion on November 8, 2016. But the Denver-based court rejected this argument in June. The law will not affect the states status as a safe Republican stronghold in the presidential election being contested by Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican Party candidate Donald Trump.

Federal judge limits some Election Day voter registration in Illinois,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A federal judge in Illinois on Tuesday blocked same-day registration at polling places in the states most populous counties, saying a law enacted last year disproportionately favored urban voters over their rural counterparts. The ruling resulted from a federal court lawsuit brought in August by a group aligned with a conservative think tank challenging a state law allowing Election Day voter registration at polling places in counties with populations of 100,000 or more. The application of this legislation favors the urban citizen and dilutes the vote of the rural citizen, Judge Samuel Der-Yeghiayan of the Northern District of Illinois wrote in his opinion on Tuesday, six weeks before the Nov. 8 election. The Chicago-based Liberty Justice Center, which filed the lawsuit, argued the population threshold unconstitutionally discriminated against voters in less populated counties and boosted Democrats in heavily Democratic Cook County, where Chicago is located.  The court ruled that if Illinois is going to have Election Day voter registration at polling places, it should be available statewide  and it should be fair, Jacob Huebert, a senior attorney for the Liberty Justice Center, or LJC, said in a statement on Tuesday. Maura Possley, a spokeswoman for the state Attorney Generals Office, was not immediately available to comment on whether there would be an appeal.  LJC was founded by the Illinois Policy Institute, which keeps its donors secret, but Republican Governor Bruce Rauner, who took office in January 2015, has publicly acknowledged giving the group at least $500,000 over a period of years.  The law, passed in late 2014 by the Democratic-led legislature and signed in early 2015 by former Democratic Governor Pat Quinn, allowed Election Day voter registration for the first time, including at polling places. But the section of the law pertaining to polling place registration pertained only to counties with populations of 100,000 or more. Democratic state Senator Don Harmon said in a statement on Tuesday he was disappointed by the decision, which came on National Voter Registration Day, calling it a blatantly political effort to quell participation in Illinois elections.     Civil rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, also expressed unhappiness with the ruling.  We are concerned about the impact of this decision, changing the rules of voting so close to this hotly contested election, Edwin Yohnka, director of communications and public policy at the ACLU of Illinois said in a statement.

U.S. announces $364 million more in aid for Syrians,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday it was providing an additional $364 million in humanitarian assistance to help Syrians caught up in the countrys civil war, bringing total U.S. humanitarian spending for Syria to about $5.9 billion. Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees and Migration Anne Richard said the funding would help provide food, shelter, safe drinking water, medical care and other support for millions of Syrian refugees and the communities that host them. Richard told a State Department briefing about three-quarters of the additional funding would help people still inside Syria and the rest would assist Syrians who have fled the country. She also said the United States had admitted some 85,000 refugees over the past fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. That figure included about 12,500 Syrian refugees, exceeding the administrations goal of 10,000, she said. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the push for additional humanitarian aid funds came in part because of deteriorating conditions in Aleppo after the collapse of a ceasefire sponsored by the United States and Russia. The forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have launched a massive push against rebel-held areas of the city, where some 250,000 civilians are believed to be trapped. Intensive bombing has killed hundreds of people, many of whom died in buildings collapsed by bunker-buster bombs. Until the past few weeks we felt like we were on a firm path towards a possible diplomatic resolution to this. We still believe thats possible, Toner told a briefing. That doesnt mean were not mindful ... of the tremendous humanitarian suffering thats going on right now in Aleppo. And thats why were working so hard to ramp up our assistance, he added. While saying the United States continued to seek a diplomatic resolution of the problem, he left the door open to other action. Well continue to weigh all options. Those discussions are ongoing. I dont want to rule anything out, but right now were focused on the diplomatic one, Toner said. He noted the United States has warned that failure to achieve a ceasefire could lead to an escalation of the conflict. We cannot dictate what other countries ... may or may not decide to do in terms of supporting certain groups within Syria, Toner said. You may have a further deterioration on either side ... and by deterioration I mean more arming and more conflict between them, and intensification of the conflict.

Stop-gap bill to avoid government shutdown fails Senate procedural vote,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A stop-gap funding bill to avoid a federal government shutdown later this week failed to garner enough votes to move forward in the Senate on Tuesday, with Democrats and Republicans both opposing the measure. The must-pass continuing resolution, or CR, which would keep federal agencies operating from Saturday through Dec. 9, received only 45 of the 60 votes needed to limit debate and be considered for passage by the 100-seat Republican-controlled Senate.  Forty Democrats and two independents opposed the CR because it lacked a $220 million aid package to address the drinking-water crisis in Flint, Michigan. It also drew opposition from 13 Republicans, including Senator Ted Cruz, the former presidential candidate. Senate leaders said they would explore alternatives to avoid a shutdown.   Without an extension, many federal agencies will run out of operating funds when the government fiscal year expires at midnight on Friday. The bill includes $1.1 billion to combat the Zika virus and $500 million for flood relief in Louisiana and other states. This is a 10-week funding bill. Its contents command broad support. It contains zero controversial riders, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said before the vote. Democrats in the Senate and House of Representatives vowed to oppose the resolution until Republicans agree to a Flint aid package that the Senate passed by a 95-3 margin this month as part of a separate water resources bill. Flint, a city with over 100,000 people, has had lead-tainted drinking water for more than two years.  Democrats, who say it is unfair to aid flood-ravaged areas and not Flint, want Republicans to include Flint aid in the CR or a version of the water resources bill that the House will vote on this week. Republicans say they will consider Flint later. Both sides say the aid package is paid for. There is no excuse - none - for not including this provision, said Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat. McConnell told reporters he would consider the possibility of removing the flood-relief provision from the CR to win support from Democrats. Lets see him do it, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said when asked about McConnells remarks. Reasons for Republican opposition ranged from disapproval of Zika funding in the measure to frustration over the absence of provisions to boost the U.S. Export-Import Bank and block international oversight of the internet.

Trump, who has struggled to convince traditional Republican donors to back his campaign, has turned to online donations from supporters to fund his campaign for the Nov. 8 election.

Senior national security official to leave Justice Department,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. Justice Department official who oversaw efforts to prosecute Islamic State sympathizers and pursue cyber criminals is leaving the Obama administration next month, he told Reuters on Tuesday. Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, chief of the national security division at the Justice Department, is departing on Oct. 15, less than a month before the U.S. presidential election.     The departure comes as the Obama administration has struggled to develop clear guidelines on how to pursue hacking amid growing threats posed by foreign nation-states and criminal groups. In an interview, Carlin, 43, declined to say where he was headed next. He intends to spend time with his family before starting a new job, likely involved in cyber security, he said. Carlin, who has served in government for more than 15 years, oversaw a range of prominent cases in three and a half years since assuming an acting rank of the Justice Departments top national security lawyer in March 2013, including the prosecution of one of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombers.  He was confirmed full-time to the position in a 99-1 vote by the U.S. Senate in April 2014.  Carlin focused on pursuing cyber criminals during his tenure running the national security division.  His tenure included the unprecedented indictment of five Chinese military hackers in 2014 for alleged hacking into six U.S. companies in order to steal trade secrets, and the indictment of Iranian hackers earlier this year for alleged hacks on U.S. financial institutions and a New York dam. In a statement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Carlin was a trusted and tireless leader who used all the tools at his disposal to enhance our public safety and uphold our national security. Carlin will be replaced by Mary McCord, principal deputy assistant attorney general, on an acting basis, the Justice Department said. Through a combination of legal cases, diplomatic sanctions and an effort to publicly name and shame hacking adversaries, Carlin sought to tame what he often called the wild west of cyberspace, where international norms for appropriate cyber activity are nascent or nonexistent. Weve laid a strong foundation in cyber, but weve got to do more, faster, given the state of the threat, Carlin told Reuters. He said he hoped the next presidential administration could further institutionalize consequences from cyber crime. Most recently Carlin announced this month the formation of a threat analysis team to study potential national security challenges posed by self-driving cars, medical devices and other Internet-connected tools. Carlins appointment in early 2014 coincided with territorial gains by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria that propelled the militant group to global notoriety. Since then, the department has prosecuted dozens of people on counts related to Islamic State: more than 100 people have been charged since 2014 in public federal cases.  Under Carlin, the national security division has also ramped up the Justice Departments efforts to combat what it sees as a rising threat from domestic anti-government extremists.

Opponents of Saudi 9/11 bill keep up fight ahead of veto override vote,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Opponents of a bill that would allow lawsuits against Saudi Arabias government over the Sept. 11 attacks kept up their fight against the measure on Tuesday, a day before the U.S. Senate is expected to oppose President Barack Obamas veto, allowing the bill to become law. Opponents circulated a letter from Ash Carter, Obamas Secretary of Defense, saying that the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, known as JASTA, posed risks for U.S. forces abroad. While we are sympathetic to the intent of JASTA, its potential second- and third-order consequences could be devastating to the Department and its Service members and could undermine our important counterterrorism efforts abroad, Carter wrote to Representative Mac Thornberry. As Reuters reported on Friday, Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, has circulated a letter to his fellow House of Representatives Republicans saying that he will vote to sustain Obamas veto and urging them to do the same. Obama vetoed the legislation on Friday. If Congress gets enough votes to override the veto for the first time since Obama became president in 2009 the bill would become law. It takes two-thirds majorities in both the Senate and House to override a veto.  The legislation passed the Senate and House without opposition, in reaction to long-running suspicions, denied by Riyadh, that the hijackers of the four U.S. jetliners that attacked the United States in 2001 were backed by the Saudi government. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals. While a few lawmakers have expressed concerns about the implications of the bill, it still has strong support, among both Republicans and Obamas fellow Democrats. Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, told reporters on Tuesday she would vote to override. She said the vote was about giving a day in court to survivors and relatives of victims of the 2001 attacks, not a rebuke of Obama. It isnt anti-president, she said.

A modest bump for Clinton in online wagering hours after debate,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintons probability of winning the White House got a modest bump in online betting markets on Tuesday, a day after her debate with Republican Donald Trump. The price for a contract favoring Clinton on the popular PredictIt betting market was up 2 cents from Mondays post-debate closing and implied a 68 percent probability that she would win the Nov. 8 election.  Although during the debate Clinton was as high as 70 percent, her Monday night closing of 66 matched the highest closing number since her health took a stumble on Sept. 11. A pro-Trump contract on Tuesday indicated his probability for victory was 34 percent. Trading in both contracts remained brisk on the heels of the first of three debates. PredictIt contracts are priced from 0 to 100 cents, with the contract price equating to a probability a candidate will win the election. Initially, the price swings for both candidates were the largest since early August, though a substantial portion of Clintons gain and Trumps fall had been retraced by early afternoon on Tuesday. The swing following the debate put the brakes on a big Trump price rally on PredictIt that coincided with a tightening in most public opinion polls. On PredictIt, the implied probability of him winning had risen to 38 percent heading into the debate from 28 percent at the end of August.  Clintons prospects also showed comparable improvement on betting sites based in Ireland and the United Kingdom. UK-based Betfair called the debate for Clinton based on odds movements on its platform, where more than 3 million pounds were bet during the event.  The implied probability of a Clinton win in November climbed to 69 percent on Betfair, the strongest it has been since her prospects took a hit over her pneumonia diagnosis this month. Trumps probability fell to 30 percent from 37 percent. On Irelands PaddyPower, Clintons odds also had shortened, or improved, to 2-to-5 from 1-to-2 in the early moments of Mondays debate. Trumps odds, which initially lengthened following the debate, had shortened modestly to 2-to-1. ",politicsNews,"September 27, 2016 ",1
Factbox: Market participants react to U.S. presidential debate,"(Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump traded barbs and accusations on Monday in the first debate ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Following is a compilation of reaction to the debate from investors, economists and financial market analysts: FACTBOX: Swing states that may determine the election: reut.rs/1UhE642 MORE COVERAGE: cpurl://apps.cp./cms/?pageId=us-2016 JAMES ATHEY, INVESTMENT MANAGER AT ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT: What were seeing in markets this morning is a small, collective sigh of relief because most commentators, and the few polls that have been released, suggest Clinton won the debate. Equities have undone much of yesterdays weakness and key Trump indicators such as the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar have rallied. This supports the notion once again that Trump is seen as protectionist and anti-globalization. The reality is that these moves are all fairly insignificant. Polls on voting intentions still show that the race is essentially neck and neck. It will be these polls which truly have the power to drive a genuine re-pricing. MICHAEL METCALFE, HEAD OF GLOBAL MACRO STRATEGY AT STATE STREET GLOBAL MARKETS, LONDON:  In a similar way that sterling became the market proxy for Brexit risk, so moves in the Mexican peso and expected volatility of the Mexican peso appear to have become the main market proxy for expressing the probability of a Trump presidency.  While there are many weeks of the campaign to run, the market reaction to the first debate does not mean that volatility will dissipate, but it does suggest Trumps recent momentum has been arrested. The recent narrowing in the polls means that markets have had to discount more uncertainty, and one debate will not settle that. The press verdict on the first U.S. presidential debate is that Hillary Clinton won, but Donald Trump didnt lose badly enough to really reduce the uncertainty. The market verdict is that the Mexican peso, the South African rand and the Korean won all won, while the Japanese yen was the loser. JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT BMO PRIVATE BANK IN CHICAGO: Investors celebrated that Hillary didnt lose. Market trading higher and the peso is strengthening. Hillary came through the debate unscathed. Trump spent more time on the defensive. BRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN: Im not sure I learned anything new listening to the debate. Neither candidate imploded, but based on the strengthening of the Mexican peso ... I think this round goes to Clinton. RANDY FREDERICK, MANAGING DIRECTOR, TRADING AND DERIVATIVES, CHARLES SCHWAB, AUSTIN, TEXAS: The positive reaction in the (equities) futures markets probably implies that Hillary Clinton was perceived as the winner. The market is often said to dislike uncertainty, and most experts seem to consider Donald Trump as the more uncertain candidate. PETER KENNY, SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST, GLOBAL MARKETS ADVISORY GROUP, NEW YORK: Both futures and the Mexican peso are accurate indicators of how markets interpreted the debates. Both moved only modestly but both moved in tandem - higher. I believe that investors pricing in the odds of either candidate winning. Modest positive moves suggest the Clinton campaign both managed expectations and delivered on beating them. The fear for investors was that she would either have some physical issue, look weak or have an excuse for one or both. She looked sharp, on point and clearly delivered on a message and style that reassured markets. BRIAN BATTLE, DIRECTOR OF TRADING, PERFORMANCE TRUST CAPITAL PARTNERS, CHICAGO: Debate really was not outside expectations. Trump was Trump and Clinton kept calm and seemed bemused.  It was underwhelming on policy and there were no gaffes or revelations. It was a personality debate, not a policy discussion. AARON JETT, VICE PRESIDENT, GLOBAL EQUITY RESEARCH, BEL AIR INVESTMENT ADVISORS, LOS ANGELES: The market wants Hillary to win. The better she does (or the worse Trump does) the better the market will do in the short term. She did well enough to sustain the market for now. She did fine and Trump rambled on at times making her look better. We should gain back some of what we lost on Monday. It is interesting that in a debate that was so full of negatives from both sides, the result in the Stock Index Futures was very positive. I guess it does show that some positives can come from an absolute free for all. I dont know that we learned much about the candidates but the market definitely liked it.Dont forget in the middle of this we also had some numbers showing slightly better growth than previously expected and that also helped the last 5 points or so in the futures rally. After a weak day some of this may just be people covering their risk overnight. MOHAMED EL-ERIAN,CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER, ALLIANZ, NEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA:  While both candidates spoke to the importance of higher economic growth whose benefits are shared more broadly, the debate highlighted their different approaches to tax policies and what ultimately delivers greater prosperity. HUGH JOHNSON, CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HUGH JOHNSON ADVISORS, ALBANY, NEW YORK: Both presented different views on reviving the economy. Secretary Clintons tax and spending plans were well articulated and well thought out. Trumps thoughts that included significant tax cuts and implicit promises of infrastructure spending were emotionally appealing but not nearly as well thought out or economically sensible. Each will appeal to different sets of voters. A good example of Trumps emotional, yet uninformed, thoughts were his comments (a) that the recovery was the worst ever, (b) that Janet Yellen was political, (c) the rise in stock prices has been a bubble that would burst if interest rates were increased. I would be inclined to give Secretary Clinton a modest edge although Trump did a good job presenting himself as the candidate of change. Her stamina answer was a real good - close to a clincher. JEFFREY GUNDLACH, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, DOUBLELINE CAPITAL, LOS ANGELES: Its the establishment versus the anti-establishment. No one wins a debate in September.Trump did himself a little bit of good and set up the later debates to his advantage. DAN IVASCYN, GROUP CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, PIMCO, NEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA: We continue to believe a Clinton victory will be the most likely outcome.

Asian viewers give nod to Clinton after first presidential debate,"BEIJING/TOKYO (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton put Donald Trump on the defensive and showed a better grasp of foreign policy issues, according to a sampling of people across Asia who watched the fiery first U.S. presidential debate.     In China, the debate was streamed live on Chinas Twitter-like Weibo service and attracted thousands of comments despite the lack of a translation into Chinese. Some called Trump a loose cannon, while others thought that as a businessman he was best qualified to lead the worlds largest economy.  William Hua, a Chinese lawyer who watched the debate at an American Chamber of Commerce event in Beijing, said he thought Clinton came out on top. He was most concerned, though, about an issue that didnt come up in the debate. Donald Trump says Japan and South Korea can develop nuclear weapons? It seems absolutely ridiculous, Hua said.  Trump said in an interview with The New York Times in March he would consider letting Japan and South Korea build their own nuclear weapons, rather than rely on America for protection against North Korea.  Opinion polls have shown the two candidates in a tight race leading up to the debate. A CNN poll of debate watchers released after the event found 62 percent felt Clinton won compared to 27 percent for Trump.   In a sign investors also saw Clinton as the winner, U.S. S&P500 stock futures rose as did Asian shares. Markets started to call the debate for Hillary within the first 15 minutes or so, with the Mexican peso surging in what is probably its busiest Asian session in years, said Sean Callow, a senior currency analyst at Westpac in Sydney.  The Mexican currency has risen and fallen in recent weeks depending on polling numbers for Trump, who has vowed to take trade protectionist measure against the United States southern neighbor and build a wall across the U.S. border with Mexico to prevent illegal immigration. Trump raised eyebrows among a packed crowd watching the debate at The American Club in Singapore when he lashed out against China.  Look at what China is doing to our country, Trump said not long after the debate began. They are devaluing their currency and we have nobody in our government to fight them ... They are using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing. Landy Eng, a former employee of the California state government whos been living in Singapore the past 20 years, said he was an undecided voter. But Trumps China-bashing is something Im not particularly in favor of, he said.  Still, Eng said he does like the  disruptive factor of Trumps campaign and thinks it is making Clinton a better candidate. Aloysius Lee, a 65-year-old retiree from Hong Kong, who watched the debate at The Foreign Correspondents Club in the territory, said that Trump was too unpredictable.  Hillary is the kind of person you can do business with, at least from my point of view, Lee said. With Trump, you dont know whats going to happen next, you dont know what hes going to say next. South Koreans, watching the debate on TV screens in the lobby of Seouls central train station, said they were with Clinton on the issues.  Trump has ideas of withdrawing U.S. forces from our country, and in terms of national security, Trump is a threatening figure, said Lee Hyo-jin, 26. So I support Hillary, she said. Trump during the debate again said if U.S. allies like Japan and South Korea dont pay their fair share, they may have to defend themselves or help us out. Asked about Trumps comment, Japans Defence Minister Tomomi Inada told a regularly scheduled news conference on Tuesday the U.S.-Japan military alliance does not just benefit Japan but is also in the interests of the United States.  Clinton seemed to have the better temperament during the debate, according to some Asian viewers.  Li Jiaoli, 21, an editing intern from Chinas southwestern province of Sichuan, said Clinton seemed more presidential while Trumps expressions made her laugh.  Trumps responses were too aggressive. High-level politicians should have more self-control, Li said. The debate prompted a storm of tweets around the region, many of them commenting on the optics of the debate. Trump is looking worked up and angry and sulky and shouty -She looks utterly in control by contrast, said Barkha Dutt, news anchor on Indias NDTV in a tweet. She ignores his barbs & attacks; he gets baited by every one of hers.  Mel Fryer, 30, a waitress at the Mercantile Hotel in Sydneys historic Rocks district said she was terrified at the prospect of a Trump presidency, while the debate screened to an empty pub. But hes going ok, she said of his debate performance. He uses simple words and simple phrases and gets his point across. ",politicsNews,"September 27, 2016 ",1
Trump's debate sniffs take off on social media,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican White House candidate Donald Trump stole the social media spotlight during Monday nights U.S. presidential debate on at least one count - what Twitter users branded his #Trumpsniffle.  The wealthy businessman sniffed repeatedly as he faced off against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in their first debate, giving rise to the hashtag and a surge of interest on social media what might be causing his nose to run. Parody accounts, Donalds Sinuses (@TrumpsSinuses) and Trump sniff (@TrumpSniff), gained a large following. Trump, 70, told Fox News on Tuesday morning he did not have a cold. No, no sniffles, no, he said. No cold. He complained he had a faulty microphone and joked that maybe it was picking up breathing. Several tweeters seized on the sniffling to hit back at Trump over his repeated digs at the health and stamina of Clinton, 68, who had pneumonia earlier this month.  Overall, Twitter said the debate, the first in a series ahead of the Nov. 8 election, was the most tweeted-about political event in the social media companys history. Trump was the focus of 62 percent of the conversation on the social media platform, Twitter said. On Facebook, conversations about Trump made up 79 percent of debate chat, while Clintons share of the conversation was 21 percent. However, sentiment appeared to go Clintons way. Social media analytics firm Zoomph said tweets mentioning Clinton ended at a ratio of about 1.5 to 1, which meant that for every negative mention, there were 1.5 positive mentions, Zoomph said. Sentiment toward Trump fluctuated, but ended nearly flat at a ratio of one positive mention to every negative one. The most tweeted-about topics were the economy, foreign affairs, energy and the environment, terrorism and guns. ",politicsNews,"September 27, 2016 ",1
"In first face-off with Clinton, Trump struggles to be 'change' candidate","HEMPSTEAD, New York (Reuters) - Running as an anti-establishment candidate, Donald Trump took the presidential debate stage on Monday night to hammer home his call for sweeping political change and try to win over millions of undecided voters.  But the Republican nominee seemed unable to capitalize on his opportunity in front of a television audience that by some estimates may have been 100-million strong. Instead of presenting himself as a change agent, he spent most of the evening trading personal insults with his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. It illustrated the paradox that has plagued Trumps campaign. Polls show an electorate hungry for change, with a majority believing the country is on the wrong track. Yet Trumps brash personality and his tendency to stir up controversy have made him, at times, a poor messenger.  Trump started strongly on Monday, sticking to the bread and butter theme of his campaign - the erosion of U.S. manufacturing jobs. But he soon lost his composure, especially when Clinton questioned his success in business and his refusal to release his tax returns and accused him of racism and sexism.  When on message Trump paints a bleak picture of a United States that is victimized by China in trade, hemorrhaging jobs to Mexico and blighted by gangs of illegal immigrants roaming the streets of warzone inner cities committing crimes.  Robert Adams, 75, an undecided voter from Boise, Idaho, said he thought Trumps dystopian view of America was correct. I think its hell in the big cities, Adams said. But after watching the debate, he viewed both the real estate magnate and Clinton as a sad choice for American voters and was leaning toward Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson. Reuters/Ipsos polling shows an electorate in a downcast mood, with 64 percent of Americans believing the country is on the wrong track. That number includes 87 percent of Republicans and 44 percent of Democrats. When Reuters asked voters to pick the first word that comes to mind when thinking about the country, the most popular choice was frustration, followed by fear and anger.  Some of Trumps strongest moments at Mondays debate were when he categorized Clinton, a former secretary of state and U.S. senator as a typical politician, accusing her of achieving nothing in her years in Congress and government. With an electorate yearning for change, Clinton is hamstrung by her long record and her close association with the Obama administration.  Rather than proposing wholesale political overhaul, Clinton  offers up a vision of a country headed in the right direction but one that needs some changes to address income inequality and create jobs.  Her more optimistic view impressed another undecided voter, Nancy Willhite, 61, of Portland, Oregon. She seems more in touch with reality to me, she said.  A Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Monday found that about half of all likely voters in the United States were looking to the debate to help them make a final decision.  Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist in Washington, said Trumps performance on Monday would have left many undecided voters with questions about his ability to lead the country. Donald Trump has to convince them that he is going to be a safe alternative and I think its open to debate whether he pulled that off, Bonjean said.  Christopher Devine, a political science professor at the University of Dayton in Ohio said Trumps message on Monday sometimes got lost in a welter of hyperbole that invited mocking responses from Clinton.  Hell identify a problem people are concerned about, but in that excitement over making that point, he goes overboard and makes claims that dont hold up. It loses its effectiveness at that point.

Clinton gains in online betting markets after U.S. presidential debate,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintons probability of winning the White House gained in online betting markets following the first debate of the campaign on Monday night between her and Republican Donald Trump. A Clinton contract on the popular PredictIt betting market gained 6 cents from the previous days level to 69 cents, while a contract favoring Donald Trumps prospects for victory tumbled 7 cents to 31 cents. Contracts are priced from 0 cents to 100 cents, with the contract price equating to a probability of whether that candidate will win the Nov. 8 election. The price swings for both candidates were the largest since early August, and placed Clintons lead in that market at the widest in about two weeks. Clintons prospects also improved on the Irish betting site Paddy Power.  About halfway through Mondays debate, she was shown as a 1-to-2 favorite, and those odds shortened to 4-to-9 in the moments after the debate ended. Trumps odds lengthened to 23-to-10 from 9-to-4. The swing following the debate put the brakes on a big Trump price rally on PredictIt that coincided with a tightening in most public opinion polls. The implied probability of him winning had risen to 38 cents on Sunday from just 28 cents at the end of August.  Bets on Trump fell as low as 5 cents on February but went up as high as 44 cents in May. Bets on Clinton, the persistent favorite in most wagering markets, went as low as 37 cents in January and as high as 79 cents in August.  The debate on Monday was the first of three scheduled face-offs between the two candidates before the Nov. 8 election. ",politicsNews,"September 27, 2016 ",1
Cost of modernizing U.S. nuclear weapons to fall to next president,"MINOT AIR FORCE BASE, N.D. (Reuters) - In this flat, windy expanse just south of the Canadian border, U.S. Air Force pilots fly the same bombers their grandfathers flew, using mid-20th century cables and pulleys. Each spring, the airmen and airwomen must clear melting snow from the steel and concrete doors of the silos that house 150 nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles scattered across thousands of square miles of the upper Great Plains. The U.S. nuclear arsenal, patched, welded, and re-skinned countless times, was built between 25 and 62 years ago when the United States found itself locked in an arms race with a rival superpower, the Soviet Union. Now, its future is an issue in the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has said she would call for a nuclear posture review, last completed in 2010, as one of her first acts upon taking office. Republican candidate Donald Trump has said he would be open to reversing decades of U.S. policy and allowing allies such as Japan and South Korea to acquire their own nuclear weapons to deter a strike from North Korea, which carried out its fifth and largest nuclear test this month. On Monday, in his first visit to Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota as U.S. Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter said Americas nuclear deterrence was the bedrock of its security, and the Pentagons No. 1 priority. If we dont replace these systems, quite simply they will age even more, and become unsafe, unreliable, and ineffective,  Carter said, speaking at a lectern in front of a B-52 bomber loaded with cruise missiles. The fact is, most of our nuclear weapon delivery systems have already been extended decades beyond their original expected service lives. So its not a choice between replacing these platforms or keeping them - its really a choice between replacing them or losing them, Carter said. Russia, he said, had built new nuclear weapons systems, raising questions as to whether its leaders were cautious enough when it came to atomic weapons. And North Korea presents a sustained threat, Carter said. Carters speech coincides with a growing realization among defense officials and experts that budget constraints almost certainly will force the next president to decide whether and how quickly to proceed with the Obama administrations plans to maintain and modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The crunch comes in the next decade as American ballistic missile submarines, bombers, and land-based missiles  the three legs of the nuclear triad  reach the end of their useful lives. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the total cost of nuclear forces through 2024 at $348 billion, but that does not include some of the costliest upgrades, scheduled for the latter half of the next decade. Independent estimates have put the cost of maintaining and modernizing the arsenal at about $1 trillion dollars over 30 years. Theres a bipartisan commitment to doing that upgrade, so we have to assume those funds will come through, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz told Reuters on Sept. 20. But it will be a significant budget increase, especially in the next decade. The Energy Department shares responsibility with the Pentagon for the nuclear arsenal, and some of its research and production facilities are 73 years old. The next administration could abandon or delay some aspects of modernization to cut costs. Or it could raise taxes, increase the budget deficit, or cut domestic programs, all unpopular steps with American voters. The most vulnerable elements of the modernization plans are a long-range standoff weapon, or LRSO  a nuclear-capable cruise missile launched from an aircraft  and new land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Ten U.S. senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, called on President Barack Obama in July to cancel the LRSO, saying it would provide an unnecessary capability that could increase the risk of nuclear war. Some Pentagon officials and defense experts have said the cruise missile would be a hedge against improved air defenses that are difficult for even a stealthy bomber to penetrate. A Clinton or Trump administration also could cut the number of land-based ballistic missiles below the 400 currently planned or delay a new missile by extending the life of the current Minuteman IIIs, which each carry a warhead with an explosive yield of at least 300 kilotons, 20 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, which killed an estimated 140,000 people.  The United States is one of five nuclear weapons states allowed to keep a nuclear arsenal under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The others are Russia, Britain, France and China. The U.S. Air Force has estimated the cost of a new ground-based system  including missiles, command-and-control systems and launch control centers  to be more than $60 billion.     Some former U.S. officials, including former defense secretary William Perry, have argued that land-based missiles are not essential and should be phased out; proponents say they are more important in the face of potential nuclear threats by Russia and North Korea. Much of the planned modernization is nearly locked in  because of the need for new weapons and because some of it is so far along, said Evan Montgomery, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington-based research group. The B-21 long-range strike bomber and the replacement for the Navys 14 Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines are the two most expensive items, and theyre arguably the two safest in a lot of ways, Montgomery said. The bomber can deliver both conventional and nuclear weapons, and the submarine is considered a priority because it would survive any first strike by an adversary. The Navy plans to replace its Ohio-class submarines, first commissioned in 1981 and armed with up to 24 Trident missiles with multiple independently targeted warheads, with 12 boats costing about $100 billion. In his speech on Monday, Carter said that most people do not realize that spending on the nuclear program is a small percentage of total defense spending. At its peak, nuclear spending would make up about five percent of the Pentagons budget, which is now around $600 billion annually, defense experts said. Still, the funding gap means that despite the Pentagons massive budget, the next president will face an unavoidable dilemma. Theres no doubt in my mind that were tens of billions of dollars short in that time frame from what it takes to execute a global strategy, said James Miller, a former undersecretary of defense for policy in the Obama administration. Its not a rounding error anymore. ",politicsNews,"September 27, 2016 ",1
Obama avoids pipeline comment but urges tribal sovereignty,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday avoided direct mention of a pipeline that has provoked high-profile protests from Native Americans but urged tribal leaders to use the spotlight to continue pushing for recognition even after he leaves office. Obama spoke at his eighth and final Tribal Nations Conference, which he created during his first year in office. Leaders of more than 560 Native American tribes gathered for the Washington event as one of the largest Native American protests in decades continues in North Dakota. In his remarks, Obama acknowledged that Native American tribes have unified around the demonstrations led by the Standing Rock Sioux, a tribe that he visited in 2014.   I know that many of you have come together across tribes and across the country to support the community at Standing Rock and together you are making your voices heard, he said. This moment highlights why its so important that we redouble our efforts to make sure that every federal agency truly consults and listens and works with you, sovereign to sovereign. In recent weeks, protests against the Dakota Access pipeline have drawn international attention, prompting the U.S. government to temporarily block its construction on federal land. Tribal leaders say the pipeline will desecrate sacred land and pollute water. When fully connected to existing lines, the 1,100-mile (1,770 km) pipeline would be the first to carry crude oil from the Bakken shale directly to the U.S. Gulf. The $3.7 billion project is being built by the Dakota Access subsidiary of Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP. Obama discussed the progress made by his administration over the last eight years to improve relations with tribal nations, and urged leaders to keep fighting for more visibility and input regardless of who succeeds him in the White House next year. Our progress depends in part on who sits the in Oval Office, and whether theyre setting the right priorities, but lasting progress depends on all of us, not just who the president is. Various Obama administration officials unveiled initiatives aimed at upholding Native American sovereignty at the conference. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell announced a forthcoming memorandum from Obama that would require federal agencies to consider Native American treaty rights in decision-making on natural resource projects, hoping to avoid future conflicts with tribes such as the current Dakota Access dispute. The Justice and Interior Departments also announced  settlements with 17 tribes that had sued the U.S. government, accusing them of mismanaging monetary assets and natural resources that the government held in trust for the tribes.  The vast majority of all such disputes have been settled, according to the government, which has paid $1.9 billion to resolve the cases since April 2012. Those settlements characterize the Obama administrations effort to mend ties where we have failed in the past in our trust responsibilities, said Lawrence Roberts, assistant secretary for Indian Affairs at the Interior Department, on the sidelines of Mondays conference. Regan Dunn, 15, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, delivered opening remarks at the conference.  Dunn said afterward she had never imagined a company might try to build a pipeline through her homeland, but that the wide opposition among various tribes - including some she had not previously heard of - has been heartwarming. Brian Cladoosby, president of the National Congress of American Indians, which represents more than 500 tribes, praised Obamas legacy on Native American issues and warned the assembly that there is no guarantee going forward there will be the same commitment from the next administration. When the Justice Department, Interior Department and the U.S. Army temporarily blocked the pipelines construction on Sept. 9, the administration called for a serious discussion about how tribes are consulted by the government on decisions over major infrastructure projects.  The Army, Interior and Justice departments will hold hearings on the shortcomings of the present process on Oct. 11, and formal discussions with tribes in six U.S. regions from Oct. 25 through Nov. 21.  The deadline for written comments will be Nov. 30, the agencies announced. On Thursday, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, Dave Archambault, told a House of Representatives panel there was no meaningful consultation before permits were issued to bring the pipeline through his tribes territory. Archambault is scheduled to speak on Monday evening at a rally of pipeline opponents. ",politicsNews,"September 26, 2016 ",1
From prairie to the White House: Inside a Tribe's quest to stop a pipeline,"CANNON BALL, N.D./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three days after guard dogs attacked Native Americans protesting an oil pipeline project in North Dakota in early September, an unprecedented event took place at the White House. Brian Cladoosby, president of the National Congress of American Indians, which represents more than 500 tribes, spoke to nearly a dozen of President Barack Obamas Cabinet-level advisers at a September 6 meeting of the White Houses three-year-old Native American Affairs Council.  It was the first time a tribal leader addressed a session of the council, and Cladoosby was invited in his role as the Indian Congress leader. Cladoosby, a Swinomish Indian from Washington state, spoke twice at the one-hour roundtable. He told Reuters he praised the Obama administration in his opening statement for its track record on Native American issues such as pushing to reform the Indian Health Service. But when Cladoosby gave his closing speech, he delivered an impassioned request to his audience: stand with Native Americans who have united with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and block construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a 1,100 mile conduit to get oil from North Dakota to Illinois.  That plea marked one of the previously unreported turning points in a drama that played out since February and culminated September 9 with an about face by the U.S. government, from giving the pipeline a green light to backing a request from North Dakotas Standing Rock Sioux to halt construction of the pipeline.  The tribe fears sacred sites could be destroyed during the lines construction and that a future oil spill would pollute its drinking water. This months win for the tribe, which could be reversed by regulators, is a rare instance of protests resulting in quick federal action and the triumph of an unusual alliance between environmentalists and Native Americans, who both say they were emboldened by the defeat of the Keystone XL pipeline last fall. It also was the most galvanizing movement in Native American politics in decades, some tribal leaders said, as Crow, Navajo, Sioux and other traditional rivals united to fight what they considered an assault on their way of life. Cladoosby did not play a high-profile role in the early days of the pipeline controversy. But that day he spoke to a high echelon of power, including Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell, White House Domestic Policy Council director Cecilia Munoz, and the heads of the Departments of Energy; Agriculture; Education; Health and Human Services; and the Environmental Protection Agency, according to a senior administration official who asked not to be named and to a photo of attendees seen by Reuters. The world is watching, he said in prepared remarks shared with Reuters. A few days earlier, video of pipeline security personnel in North Dakota armed with guard dogs and mace trying to disperse protesters went viral on social media. One of the first videos was taken and posted on Facebook by Lonnie Favel, a member of Utahs Ute tribe who traveled to North Dakota to support the protests. I was getting messages of support from New Zealand, from Europe, from all over the world, Favel said. Until then, Obama had not weighed in on the Dakota dispute even though he personally had visited  the Standing Rock in June 2014. Just a day after Cladoosby issued his plea to administration officials, Obama attended a young leaders conference in Laos where a Malaysian woman asked him about the Dakota Access pipeline and how he could ensure a clean water supply and protect ancestral land. Obama said he needed to ask his staff for more information, but touted his track record protecting Native Americans ancestral lands, sacred sites, waters and hunting grounds, adding, this is something that I hope will continue as we go forward. In late 2014, pipeline operator Energy Transfer Partners made a fateful decision. Dallas-based ETP chose to route its proposed Dakota Access pipeline away from North Dakotas capital, Bismarck, and southward within half a mile of the Standing Rock Sioux tribes reservation. Part of its rationale, laid out in a report for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which regulates infrastructure projects that traverse certain inland waterways, was that the route would avoid Bismarck and thus pose no threat to the citys water supply. The Bismarck route also is more populated and thus would require more easements from multiple landowners. Ironically, that 139-page report concluded the Standing Rock route would raise no environmental justice issues because the pipeline would not cross tribal lands. The Army Corps decision angered environmental activists and unwittingly introduced a powerful new element into the environmental movement: Indian rights groups, who quickly tapped into an extensive network of green activists forged during five long years of protests against TransCanadas Keystone XL pipeline, which Obama formally nixed last November. The protest gained steam in February when Standing Rock Sioux leaders asked for legal help from Earthjustice, an environmental law group that had previously helped U.S. tribes and Canadian First Nations fight Kinder Morgans Trans Mountain pipeline, according to Jan Hasselman, an attorney from Earthjustice working on the North Dakota case, and tribal leaders. Two months later, about 18 tribe members started praying daily near the pipelines planned route in North Dakota. The participants would grow in size, creating a group called the Sacred Stone Camp. The international environmental movement soon took notice, including, 350.org, an environmentalist group that helped defeat the Keystone XL pipeline. In July, the group sent a delegation to the Sacred Stone Camp to see how they could help. In many ways, the Dakota Access pipeline drew its inspiration from the fight to stop the Keystone XL pipeline, according to organizers from 350 and other environmental groups. We didnt have to totally reinvent the wheel, said Josh Nelson of Credo, a progressive advocacy group. By then the Sacred Stone Camp, located alongside the confluence of the Cannon Ball and Missouri rivers about an hour south of Bismarck, had swollen in size to thousands, forming a de facto town of  tents, teepees and trailers, a school, medic, communal kitchen, horse corrals and a legal clinic. The tribal members and environmentalists agreed to seize on the U.S. Army Corps fast-tracking of permits for the pipeline in late July, which they argued was illegal and a violation of tribal rights, 350.org told Reuters. In this case, the Corps had the right to approve pipelines in general and consider specific local concerns, such as Native issues, if appropriate. The Corps said it effectively considered its due diligence requirement met when it green lit the line in July.  Later that same month, the tribe filed suit against the Army Corps in federal court. While the governments reversal in September caught most by surprise, a March 29 letter from the Department of the Interior to the Army Corps reviewed by Reuters shows that disagreements within the administration had been percolating for months. The Interior department, which is responsible for protecting Native Americans welfare, said the Army Corps did not adequately justify or otherwise support its conclusion that there would be no significant impacts upon the surrounding environment and community from the pipeline. Energy Transfer, the Department of Justice, the Army Corps and the Department of the Interior did not respond to requests for comment. The letter presaged the intra-government fighting ahead of the White Houses decision to temporarily block the line. The federal delay of the pipeline isnt something that just fell out of the sky, Archambault, the tribes chairman, said in an interview. We feed (federal regulators) information all the time on everything thats illegal here. Archambault declined to discuss responses from federal regulators he received. On September 9, just three days after Cladoosby made his plea at the White House, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg rejected a request from the tribe to block the $3.7 billion project. Minutes after that ruling, the Interior and Justice Departments, along with the Army Corps, suspended construction on a two-mile stretch of federal land below the Missouri River. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said federal regulators, who could still ultimately approve the project, called the pause to make sure the concerns of all parties were taken into account. James Gette, a senior official in the environment and natural resources division of the DOJ, noted in a September 16 hearing that construction was halted mainly because the Dakota Access pipeline didnt have an easement for the area where the tribe gets its drinking water. Protesters have vowed not to leave their camp until the pipeline is scrapped or moved far away from their reservation. Their concerns about potential spills, it turns out, have precedent. An analysis of government data by Reuters shows that Sunoco Logistics, the future operator of the pipeline and a unit of ETP, has had the highest rate of spills since 2010 than any of its competitors. Sunoco told Reuters it has taken measures to reduce its spill rate. Cladoosby admits he was really surprised by the fast moving events after his strategically-timed entreaty. He will be back at the White House on Monday and Tuesday. Leaders of 567 native American tribes will meet with Obama in Washington to tackle a range of issues facing Native Americans from economic development to environmental protection  including the Dakota Access pipeline.

U.S. senator seeks SEC probe of Yahoo disclosure on hacking,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic Senator Mark Warner on Monday asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate whether Yahoo YHOO.O and its senior executives fulfilled obligations to inform investors and the public about a hacking attack affecting 500 million user accounts. Disclosure is the foundation of federal securities laws, and public companies are required to disclose material events that shareholders should know about, Warner said in a letter to SEC Chairwoman Mary Jo White. Yahoo has faced pointed questions about exactly when it knew about the 2014 cyber attack announced last week that exposed the email credentials of half a billion accounts, a critical issue for the company as it seeks to prevent the breach from affecting a pending takeover of its core business by Verizon Inc (VZ.N). Warner also asked the SEC to probe whether Yahoo has made complete and accurate representations about the security of its information technology systems, and for the agency to evaluate its current thresholds for how and when companies need to report a material data breach. Although the SEC has longstanding guidance on when publicly traded companies should report hacking incidents, companies that have experienced known breaches often omit those details in regulatory filings, according to a 2012 Reuters investigation.(reut.rs/2dblx5S) In a Sept. 9 regulatory filing with the SEC, Yahoo stated it did not have knowledge of any incidents of, or third party claims alleging ... unauthorized access of personal data of its customers that could have a material adverse effect on Verizons acquisition. Establishing that Yahoo is liable for damages under SEC rules is a pretty high bar in data breach cases, said Robert Cattanach, a lawyer at Dorsey & Whitney who specializes in cyber security.  Yahoo is additionally protected from liability given the relative lack of sensitivity of the data compromised, Cattanach said, though he said both the SEC and Federal Trade Commission were likely to open investigations. At least one state, Massachusetts, is also seeking more information from Yahoo about the breach, a spokesperson for the states attorney general told Reuters on Monday.  Yahoo has so far not provided a clear, detailed timeline about when it was made aware of the breach announced Thursday.  Cyber security services firm Stroz Friedberg has been hired by Yahoo to help investigate the breach, firm spokeswoman Carolyn Vadino said.  The FBI is also investigating the hack, which Yahoo has blamed on a state-sponsored actor although the company has not provided technical information to support that claim.

"Mexicans prefer Clinton to Donald Trump, poll shows","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexicans favor U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over Republican Donald Trump by a 10-1 ratio, according to a poll. The poll, conducted byConsultaMitofsky and released last week, showed that 2.9 percent of Mexicans have a favorable opinion of Trump, compared to 30.4 percent for Clinton.  The poll comes almost a month after a meeting between Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City sparked outrage across the country and led to the resignation of Luis Videgaray as finance minister. Roy Campos, director of the Mitofsky polling firm, said Mexican interest in the U.S. presidential election signified a change from years past.  While in the election of 2008 the interest awakened by [Democratic President Barack] Obama was based on approval ... now the interest is because of fear, Campos said, adding that Trump is the least popular U.S. presidential candidate among Mexicans in history. When he announced his candidacy last year, Trump said Mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers to the United States and that he would build a wall on the southern U.S. border and make Mexico pay for it. He also has threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Mexico, deport millions of migrants and ditch the North American Free Trade Agreement. The poll, which was conducted between Sept. 2 and 5, surveyed 1,000 Mexicans and had a margin of error of 3.1 percent. ",politicsNews,"September 26, 2016 ",1
Senate sets Wednesday vote on Obama veto of Saudi September 11 bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will vote on Wednesday on whether to override President Barack Obamas veto of a bill allowing relatives of victims in the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia. The vote, which Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell set as the chamber reconvened on Monday, would be the first action in an attempt by lawmakers to override Obamas Sept. 23 veto of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. A successful override requires support from two-thirds of lawmakers in both the Senate and House of Representatives, which are controlled by Republicans. Known as JASTA, the legislation passed the Senate and House in reaction to long-running suspicions, denied by Saudi Arabia, that hijackers of the four U.S. jetliners that attacked the United States in 2001 were backed by the Saudi government. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals. In vetoing the bill, Obama warned that other countries could use the law as an excuse to sue U.S. diplomats, members of the military or companies, even for actions of foreign organizations that had received U.S. aid, equipment or training. McConnell said Wednesdays vote will follow two hours of debate divided between Republicans and Democrats. No time for the vote has been set.   ",politicsNews,"September 26, 2016 ",1
Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation: Clinton leads in Florida,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton has pulled ahead of Republican rival Donald Trump in the traditional battleground state of Florida, strengthening her position in the race for the White House, the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project showed ahead of the pairs first presidential debate on Monday night. If the election were held on Monday, Clinton would lead Trump in the Electoral College by 259 to 191, with an 88 percent chance of reaching the 270 needed to win, according to the projects results. The project, based on a weekly online tracking poll of more than 15,000 Americans, estimates state-by-state results that will drive the voting in the Electoral College, the body that ultimately selects the president. The results marked the first upward swing in the project for Clinton in several weeks. The last release of the poll, on Sept. 16, gave her a 61 percent chance of winning by a margin of about 14 Electoral College votes.The big difference now is that Florida, with its 29 Electoral College votes, favors Clinton 49 percentage points to Trumps 45 points, the results showed. Trump has also lost ground in New Mexico, where he trails 47 points to 38 points. Colorado and Nevada, which had leaned toward Trump, are now too close to call. Together, those states represent another 20 Electoral College votes. Clinton lost ground in Oregon and Wisconsin, which are also too close to call. They amount to 17 votes combined. As many as 100 million viewers have been estimated for Monday evenings debate at Hofstra University in New York states Long Island, which will begin at 9 p.m.  Whether that high interest translates into a higher turnout on Election Day on Nov. 8 remains to be seen. A higher turnout would likely benefit Clinton, while the opposite would benefit Trump, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, whose latest estimate is for a moderate turnout. Trumps easiest path to victory would depend on a surge in turnout among white Republicans and lower-than-expected turnout among minority Democrats, according to the project. In that scenario, several Clinton-leaning states could flip. Florida, for example, would be a tossup, while Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina would lean toward the Republican.  The States of the Nation results came as Clintons standing in national opinion polls have seen a small bounce in recent days. A separate Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll released on Friday, for example, had her ahead by four points, up from a near tie two weeks ago.  ",politicsNews,"September 26, 2016 ",1
"Ahead of debate, Trump endorsed by some Bush alumni","NEW YORK (Reuters) - (This story corrects sixth paragraph to say Matt Schlapp was White House political director, not deputy.) Dozens of former appointees of the administration of former President George W. Bush announced their support for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Sunday in a bid for party unity ahead of Trumps first debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton. The Bush family and many connected to it remain cool to Trump. Former President George H.W. Bush reportedly plans to vote for Clinton in the Nov. 8 election while his Jeb, a former Trump rival, has said he will not vote for Clinton or Trump. George W. Bush has avoided the presidential race while helping raise money for Republican congressional candidates. But a number of former Bush appointees have decided to endorse Trump, the New York businessman who is in a tight race with Clinton and is to debate her one-one-one at Hofstra University on Monday night in Hempstead, New York. Fifty former Bush appointees were on a list of people described as founding members of a coalition of Bush alumni supportive of Trump. The list was provided by a Republican official close to the Trump campaign. The list included former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, former Treasury Secretary John Snow and former Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson. The list also included former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, former Veterans Affairs Secretary Anthony Principi and former White House political director Matt Schlapp, who is chairman of the American Conservative Union. Thompson, in a statement, explained his decision to be on the list. Americans want to trust our leaders again, to know that they are fighting for everyday Americans by creating jobs, growing our economy, defending our nation from terrorism, and respecting the voters enough to be straight-forward and honest with them, Thompson said. Trump has struggled to rally many in the Republican Party behind him. On Friday, he received the endorsement of former rival Ted Cruz, but many establishment figures remain skeptical about him, such as Ohio Governor John Kasich. ",politicsNews,"September 26, 2016 ",1
"Ahead of debate, Trump endorsed by U.S. immigration officers","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump picked up the endorsement on Monday of the union representing 5,000 federal immigration officers, a boost of support for his immigration policy ahead of his first debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump has laid out a hardline position on illegal immigration, proposing to build a wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico and take other steps to crack down on the flow of undocumented people crossing into the United States. With immigration likely to be discussed at the debate, the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, a union representing 5,000 federal immigration officers and law enforcement support staff, announced it would support Trump, in what was described as its first endorsement of a candidate for elected office. The unions president, Chris Crane, outlined in a statement why his group is backing Trump, saying his union members are the last line of defense for American communities and that his members are prevented from enforcing the most basic immigration laws. A CNN/ORC poll released on Sept. 7 said that among registered voters, 49 percent said they trusted Clinton to handle immigration, a slight advantage over Trump, who was at 47 percent.  Crane said the endorsement was conducted by a vote of the unions membership and that Clinton received only 5 percent of the vote. ",politicsNews,"September 26, 2016 ",1
Canada works to counter protectionist mood of U.S. campaign,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian diplomats are fanning out across the United States to talk up the benefits of trade with state and local leaders and counter what senior officials see as a worrying mood of protectionism swirling through the U.S. election campaign. Amid voter anger about the supposed harm done by international trade deals, both Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton have talked about altering the three-nation North American Free Trade Agreement. That could have calamitous results for Canada, which sends 75 percent of all its exports to the United States. From trade forums in Kentucky, California and Illinois addressing state legislators and small-business owners to meetings with mayors, labor unions and interest groups, a team of diplomats has gone coast to coast to explain how important Canada is as a trading partner. The diplomatic offensive comes amid concerns in Ottawa about both candidates, who opinion show are in a tight race ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Trump has talked about renegotiating the NAFTA treaty with Canada and Mexico to secure more favorable terms for the United States. But he has also said he would revive TransCanada Corps cross-border Keystone XL pipeline project, which Democratic President Barack Obamas administration blocked over environment concerns. Clinton has said she opposes Keystone XL. Current and former government officials in Ottawa said a Clinton presidency posed its own challenges for Canada. They see the Democrat as tough on trade and more hawkish than Democratic President Barack Obama, who quickly struck up a warm relationship with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.  While tough talk on trade has occurred in previous U.S. election campaigns, there is an undercurrent and a mood here which is concerning me, said David MacNaughton, Canadas ambassador to Washington. A Clinton campaign representative declined to comment when asked about her approach to Canada if she were elected. Trumps campaign could not immediately be reached for comment. MacNaughton, who took up the job in March, has already visited Denver, Colorado Springs and Boston and plans trips to Massachusetts, Michigan and California next month. An embassy spokeswoman said diplomats were intensifying their outreach effort and doing more events than usual. At every meeting, they hand out tip sheets showing Canada is the top export destination for 35 U.S. states and that 9 million U.S. jobs depend on trade with Canada. Trudeau will not say which candidate he favors, stressing he is happy to work with whomever U.S. voters elect. But his center-left Liberals have more policies in common with U.S. Democrats. Elected last October, he and Obama have become close, exchanging visits to each others countries.  Some of the issues that we are going to be facing will be very much the same regardless of who wins. ... I think we have to prepare to deal with some pretty difficult situations on the trade front, said MacNaughton, adding that some Americans had little idea about the size of the U.S. trading relationship with Canada. Roland Paris, who served as Trudeaus foreign policy adviser until late June, said Trump had tapped into some very strong anti-trade sentiment. Those feelings arent going away any time soon ... we may be heading into some protectionist headwinds, even with a Hillary Clinton presidency, he said.  Trump and Clinton also oppose a proposed Pacific trade deal that could benefit Canada. One person with day-to-day knowledge of the U.S.-Canada trade file also predicted strains over Canadian exports of softwood lumber, as well as Canadas system of protection for its dairy industry, which U.S. producers strongly dislike. Another potential area for concern is Canadas defense spending, which is 0.98 percent of gross domestic product, far below the 2 percent commitment agreed on by NATO members. MacNaughton said that in his talks with Republicans and Democrats, both had raised the issue of U.S. allies stepping up to the plate in military terms. Trump stirred concerns among allies and even some Republicans earlier this year by saying he would decide whether to come to the aid of Baltic NATO allies in the event of Russian aggression only after reviewing if they have fulfilled their obligations to us. Former Canadian diplomat Colin Robertson, who had several postings in the United States, also predicted hard discussions with Clinton administration officials over defense. We will be circled because we are at 0.98 percent, said Robertson, vice president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute. That may not sit well with Trudeaus government, which is pledging to run large budget deficits for at least the next five years to fund investment in infrastructure and social programs. A government source said Canada had taken part in a number of high-profile NATO missions and was ready to push back on demands to increase spending in the military. Were quite prepared and proud to stand up on our record and explain why there might be a discrepancy between numbers ... and our actual contribution, said the source, who asked not to be identified given the sensitivity of the topic.

"Debates to help half of U.S. voters decide between Clinton, Trump: poll","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Half of Americas likely voters will rely on the presidential debates to help them make their choice between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Monday. The results show the stakes for the White House rivals as they prepare to face off on Monday at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York, for their first of three one-on-one debates, a prime-time TV spectacle expected to draw a Super Bowl-sized audience of 100 million Americans. Some 50 percent of likely voters think the debates will help inform their decision of whom to support, including 10 percent who say they are not currently leaning either way, according to the opinion poll.  Some 39 percent said the debates will not help, and 11 percent said they did not know how the debates would affect them. In a strong signal that most viewers will also be hoping the debates bring clarity, some 72 percent of respondents said they want to see moderators point out when a candidate says something that is untrue. That included 73 percent of people who identified themselves as Trump supporters and 82 percent of those who said they back Clinton, according to the results. It helps the audience, particularly me, to recognize whats bull crap and whats real, said Harvey Leven, 63, a teacher from Farmington Hills, Michigan. Its easy for the candidates to quote a statistic and people accept it. Clinton currently leads in most national polls and holds critical advantages in key swing states like Ohio and North Carolina. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll finds Clinton leading Trump nationally by 4 percentage points. Clinton had seen her popularity dip in recent weeks after more questions arose about her family foundation and the use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.  NO TO NAME-CALLING  Many voters are hoping to see a relatively civilized debate, after months of mutual attacks between Trump and Clinton on the campaign trail. Trump has called for Clinton to be jailed for her handling of emails as Americas top diplomat. Clinton has accused Trump of racism and of being temperamentally unfit for the Oval Office. Of those polled, 61 percent said they are not interested in those kinds of attacks. Quit picking on each other, said Lisa Miller, 48, of St. Louis, Missouri. This isnt a playground. Grow up and talk about your plan.  A plurality of likely voters want to hear both Clinton and Trump talk about jobs and the economy, the poll found.  Ill tell you with Donald Trump I want to see that he has rational answers to questions without name calling, said Leven.I want to try to get beyond the political hocus pocus that both of them are doing and try to see who they really are. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It included 2,124 American adults, including 1,337 people who were deemed to be likely voters due to their voting history, registration status and stated intention to show up on Election Day. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points for all respondents and 3 percentage points for likely voters. ",politicsNews,"September 26, 2016 ",1
Trump tells Netanyahu he would recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Sunday told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that if elected, the United States would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, the campaign said, marking a potential dramatic shift in U.S. policy.  During the meeting that lasted more than an hour at Trump Tower in New York, Trump told Netanyahu that under his administration, the United States would recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the State of Israel. While Israel calls Jerusalem its capital, few other countries accept that, including the United States. Most nations maintain embassies in Tel Aviv.  Palestinians want East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in a 1967 war, as capital of the state they aim to establish alongside Israel in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Netanyahu held a separate meeting later on Sunday that lasted just under an hour with Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trumps rival in the Nov. 8 U.S. election. Clinton emphasized her commitment to the U.S.-Israel relationship and her plan to take the relationship to the next level, according to a statement from her campaign. She also talked about her commitment to a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict that guarantees Israels future as a secure and democratic Jewish state with recognized borders and provides the Palestinians with independence, sovereignty, and dignity, according to the statement. Secretary Clinton reaffirmed her opposition to any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council, the statement said. During the meeting with Trump, the Republican candidates campaign said he agreed with Netanyahu that peace in the Middle East could only be achieved when the Palestinians renounce hatred and violence and accept Israel as a Jewish State.  The Trump campaign said he and Netanyahu discussed at length Israels border fence, cited by Trump in reference to his own controversial immigration policies, which include building a wall on the U.S.- Mexico border and temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country. Other regional issues, including the fight against Islamic State, U.S. military assistance to Israel - an excellent investment - and the Iran nuclear deal, which both parties have criticized, were also discussed.

Clinton to press Trump to spell out policy plans in presidential debate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton will press Republican Donald Trump to provide more specifics on his policies in their presidential debate on Monday, two top Clinton campaign aides said ahead of a face-off that could set U.S. television audience records.     On the eve of the debate at Hofstra University in suburban New York, aides to Clinton have sought to cast Trump, a New York businessman and former reality TV host, as lacking the temperament and experience to serve as president. Trumps aides for their part have sought to reinforce voter doubts about Clintons trustworthiness. The debate, the first of three face-to-face matchups between the two candidates, will begin at 9 p.m. on Monday (0100 GMT on Tuesday). It comes as opinion polls show a tight race between Clinton, a former secretary of state, and Trump, six weeks before the Nov. 8 election. Were going to have a lot of people really tuning into this election for the first time. Theyre going to see these two candidates onstage, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said on Sunday in an interview with ABCs This Week. I think theyre going to see that Donald Trump is unfit, unprepared, and over his head. I doubt he will have a command of the issues. Mook said Clinton would challenge Trump at the debate to reveal what his plans are. You know, for example, he has not revealed any plan whatsoever to defeat ISIS (Islamic State) militants. Trump has said he would work closely with NATO allies to defeat Islamic State and vowed to wage a military, cyber and financial war against the militant group. Donald Trumps been all about himself. But shes got to tell people what she wants to do for them, John Podesta, chairman of Clintons campaign, told NBCs Meet the Press on Sunday. Trumps campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, in a separate This Week interview on Sunday, attacked Clintons trustworthiness. You know, if youre running against a Clinton, veracity is certainly always on the table, she said. Hillary Clintons casual relationship with the truth is well known to Americans. Im sure well see it on full display tomorrow night. The Trump campaign put to rest on Sunday the prospect that he might invite Gennifer Flowers, who had an affair with Clintons husband, former President Bill Clinton, to attend the debate. After Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, a Clinton supporter and vociferous critic of Trump, tweeted that he had a front-row seat to watch the Hofstra debate, Trump raised the possibility in a tweet of inviting Flowers to the debate. But Mike Pence, Trumps running mate, told Fox News Sunday that Flowers would not attend the debate. Donald Trump was using the tweet yesterday really to mock an effort by Hillary Clinton and her campaign to really distract attention from what the American people are going to be focused on tomorrow night, which is on the issues, on the choice that we face, Pence said. Supporters of both candidates sought to manage expectations before the debate. Mook said the moderator of Mondays debate, NBC News anchor Lester Holt, should fact-check candidates statements, although Trumps campaign said it should be up to American voters to gauge who they thought was telling the truth. To prepare for the debate, Clinton has been holding mock debate sessions where longtime aide Philippe Reines plays the role of Trump. Trump aides said their candidate, who like Clinton participated in numerous TV debates during their respective parties nominating races, was preparing for Mondays event but not doing mock debates where someone plays the role of Clinton. Trumps advisers said the Republican presidential nominee was going up against a highly seasoned politician. Hes the outsider, hes a person who has never run before, let alone be in a presidential debate, but hes going to be ready, said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. And I think one of the things Donald Trump has going for him is hes got very good instincts. ",politicsNews,"September 25, 2016 ",1
"For some Democrats, it's voting for Clinton - and keeping it quiet","NEW YORK (Reuters) - One would expect voters from the heavily Democratic Brooklyn neighborhood of Cobble Hill to pick presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 general election. Just dont expect them to advertise it. Like lawns and windowsills in liberal pockets across the country, much of the neighborhood is bereft of pro-Clinton signage in the final weeks before the election. Its a stark contrast to the 2012 and 2008 campaigns, when President Barack Obama whipped up a frenzy of support from Democrats and his signature Hope and Forward signs were ubiquitous.  The scarcity of lawn and window signs is an indication of the Democratic nominees struggle to generate enthusiasm among left-leaning voters, a challenge thats borne out in polling data, and could potentially haunt her if voters fail to turn out on election day. Clinton leads Republican challenger Donald Trump by four percentage points among likely voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Friday.  But Americans of all political stripes have been more critical of Clinton than they were of Obama when he was running for his second term four years ago, according to the daily tracking poll.  Among Democrats, 78 percent say they have a favorable view of Clinton, lower than the 89 percent favorability rating Obama had at this point in the race in 2012. Clintons favorability drops to 28 percent among independents versus Obamas 47 percent. Nancy Kimmel Viola, a 63-year-old social worker who lives about a mile away from Clintons campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, keeps a Bernie 2016 sticker taped to the front door of her Carroll Gardens home, a vestige of her support for the unsuccessful bid of Sen. Bernie Sanders. While she plans to vote for Clinton, she confesses that her hearts not in it. I have to vote for her. Viola said. Having Trump in there is too scary. In Denver, residents in the Democratic stronghold of Park Hill posted many yard signs over a local zoning issue, but few for the presidential race. Most of us around here will vote Democratic, we always do, but were not overly enthusiastic for Clinton, said resident Pablo Marron. But we are united in our opposition to Trump. In the heavily Democratic Denver suburb of Northglenn, banners for local office-seekers littered a major roadway, but there were no accompanying Clinton signs. In the affluent liberal Washington DC suburb of Chevy Chase, Maryland, signs for the Democratic nominee appeared only roughly once every 10 blocks. The lack of enthusiasm isnt just hitting the Clinton campaign. Americans from both major parties say they are generally less interested in voting this year than they were in 2012, according to the Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll, which compared results gathered during the first 20 days of September with the same period of 2012. The Clinton campaign did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Clintons online store displayed roughly a dozen different signs and banners for sale, ranging from an 11-inch by 17-inch sign, sold at $10 for a pack of two, to a four-foot by six-foot Hillary for America banner, which retailed for $100. Sales data was not immediately available and a request for comment from the store went unanswered. For some, there is a hold your nose quality to this election, said Matthew Dallek, associate professor at George Washington Universitys Graduate School of Political Management. The lack of signage in liberal enclaves may indicate, Dallek said, that there just isnt this sort of enthusiasm that existed for Obama. But there are some blocks that buck the trend. On a street in Gowanus, Brooklyn, no fewer than four homes bore pro-Clinton signage, including a life-size cutout of the Democratic nominee, which rests in the windowsill of retired lawyer Chris Morrisons home. The beaming cardboard Clinton prompts many passersby to take pictures, said Morrison, a staunch Clinton supporter. You dont see as much signage this time around. In this neighborhood I dont get so concerned (because everyone is) more or less on the same page, said Morrison, 66. I worry when I go to some other places. ",politicsNews,"September 25, 2016 ",1

Kerry's ceaseless diplomacy faces sternest test on Syria,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - John Kerry had heard enough. After last weeks bombing of a U.N.aid convoy in Syria dealt a deathblow toa ceasefire deal in which he had invested all his diplomatic capital with Russia,the U.S. Secretary of State tossedaside a page of notes and looked at Russian Foreign Minister SergeiLavrov across the horseshoe-shaped table in the U.N.Security Council. I listened to my colleague from Russia, and I sort of felt a little bit like theyre sort of in a parallel universe here, said a visibly angry Kerry, effectively calling Lavrov a liar for blaming the United States for spoiling the ceasefire. The moment in some ways capturedthe former politicians timeas the top U.S. diplomat, which will end with a new administration in January. Not for the first time, Kerryhad invested months of intensive diplomacy and tireless traveling on an issue only to end up feeling let down or deceived by negotiating partners. On Syria, Kerry has wanted greater U.S. involvement than President Barack Obama was willing to support. In an interview on Friday with Reuters, Kerry said Lavrovs blatant obfuscation of reality ... took my breath away. TheattemptedSyria ceasefire was his most ambitious effort to fix what some argue was the biggest foreign policy misstep of Obamas administration, which began with the failure in 2013 to follow through on a red line threat against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad over the use of chemical weapons. Kerry hammered out the truce two weeks ago, but was left pleading in vain with Russia last week to halt renewed air strikes on the besieged city of Aleppo.  James Dobbins, a former U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan, noted Kerrys tireless, ceaseless engagement even when pursuing administration policies he didnt alwaysagree with. Kerry to his credit has stayed in the game even when he had a weak hand, said Dobbins, a career diplomat who worked alongside Kerry in 2013 to hammer out a deal with President Hamid Karzai to keep U.S. forces in Afghanistan.  The situation in Syria is too serious and too consequential to simply back off and leave it to others.  From Kerrys perspective, it is better to fail than not to have tried. The weakest hand of all would be to have another round of migrants going into Europe, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin do whatever he wants by dropping bombs and the United States doing nothing but pretending were sending some support to people, Kerry told Reuters. That is the weakest hand,and it is far stronger to stand up and find a way to leverage getting to the table and getting some kind of an understanding, he added. In his nearly four years as Americas top diplomat, Kerry has racked up more miles than any other secretary of state, sometimes appearing to rush in without a clear strategy. It is clear that Kerry is prepared to take greater risks with his own personal reputation than others might have ... because they did not want to be identified with failure, said Dobbins.     But some critics say Kerry stayed in the game too long in negotiating with Russia, which they argue manipulated his quest for a deal over Syria to strengthen its position. The Syrian conflict, with its shifting geopolitical forces, complex new alliances and new threats such as the rise of Islamic State, has tested Kerry like no other issue. After Obama declined to carry out threatened attacks on Assads forces over chemical weapons, Kerry perceived an opening to work with Lavrov on an agreement to get Syria to turn over its chemical arsenal, he told Reuters. That deal struck in 2013 was considered a success, but the war has since deteriorated and grown more complex following Russias military intervention backing Assad last year. Now the continuing ceasefire push by Kerry strikes some as hopeless gesturing. Kerrys plan is to do more of the same despite the repeated failure of U.S. attempts to strike a deal with Russia, said Mutasem Alsyofi of the Syrian Civil Society Declaration Initiative, who met Kerry in New York last week. Its not the first time Kerrys been accused of overreaching. At the start of his term in 2013, Kerry vigorously pursued a peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians.  Even as others warned of failure, an undaunted Kerry spent months shuttling between Jerusalem and Ramallah. However, U.S. ally Israels announcement of 700 new housing units for Jewish settlements in territory the Palestinians claim for a future state finally caused the talks to collapse, although Israel blamed the Palestinians move to apply to join 15 international conventions and treaties. Kerrys biggest accomplishments came in 2015 with the Iran nuclear deal and the U.N. climate change agreement. In both instances, he had Obamas leadership and full support for the very visible U.S. role, though both deals have been vilified domestically in the polarized American political environment. Last weeks failure of a second Syrian ceasefire agreement brokered by Kerry unleashed a fresh round of stinging criticism of the administrations Syria policy. Republican Senator John McCain called Kerry intrepid but delusional for placing too much faith in the prospect of cooperation with Russia. Kerry, a Vietnam veteran who lost to George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election, is not running for office again and has often remarked that he has nothing to lose. In this business of diplomacy, you have to test things sometimes, he told Reuters. It is a mistake to delude yourself. It is also a mistake to avoid putting something to test where there is a reasonable chance something may be able to happen. Hours after the tense exchange at the U.N. Security Council, Lavrov and Kerry met again. The Russian diplomat had brought a new proposal for putting the ceasefire back on track. Kerry looked at the sheet of paper, folded it tightly and stuffed it into his top pocket. ",politicsNews,"September 25, 2016 ",1

Clinton server tech told FBI of colleagues' worries about system,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A technician hired by Hillary Clinton to run the private email system she used while U.S. secretary of state told investigators he tried to pass on colleagues concerns that the system might not comply with records laws, FBI interview summaries show.  Bryan Pagliano, the technician Clinton hired when she joined the State Department in 2009, told federal investigators he relayed the concerns to Cheryl Mills, then Clintons chief of staff. Mills, whose lawyer did not respond to requests for comment, has previously testified under oath she could not recall anyone alerting her to potential problems with Clintons email arrangement. The episode had not been disclosed until the Federal Bureau of Investigation released on Friday night nearly 200 pages of additional records from its year-long investigation into the handling of classified government documents by Clinton and her staff via an unauthorized email server in the basement of her New York home. Clinton has said the decision to use a private email system was a mistake, but the controversy has dogged her campaign as the Democratic candidate for the presidency and raised public doubts about her trustworthiness, public opinion polls show. Republicans have criticized her for putting national security at risk. The FBI closed the year-long investigation in July, recommending no charges, although FBI Director James Comey said Clinton and her staff had been extremely careless in handling classified government secrets. Pagliano has declined to answer questions by Republican lawmakers about his work on Clintons server, but spoke to federal investigators after securing a form of immunity from prosecution. He told investigators two colleagues from the technology office approached him with concerns during Clintons first year after learning about the email system. One said it could lead to a federal records retention issue, Pagliano told investigators, and urged him to raise the concern with Clintons inner circle. A colleague also warned Pagliano he wouldnt be surprised if classified information was being sent through Clintons unsecure system, Pagliano told the FBI. The newly released interview summaries from the FBI investigation show government employees undercutting other aspects of the public accounts given by Clinton and senior State officials. A State Department employee, whose name was redacted, told investigators they believed senior department officials interfered with the screening of Clintons emails for public release last year in a way that helped Clinton.  The employee, who worked on the screening process, said there was pressure to obscure the fact they were finding classified information in the messages. John Kirby, a State Department spokesman, said in a statement the department strongly disputes the claim of interference. Clinton repeatedly said last year she never sent or received classified information, but now says she did not do so knowingly since the release of the FBI findings. The employee also said the Defense Department told the State Department last year it had found about 1,000 emails between Clinton and David Petraeus in its records from his time as the director of the United States Central Command. The State Department has said that Clinton did not include any of her emails with Petraeus when her lawyers screened and returned what they said were all her work emails in 2014. A single conversation of about 10 emails later emerged last year after the Defense Department provided it. Spokesmen for Clinton have declined to discuss the omission, and did not respond to questions about the new interview summaries. Kirby, the department spokesman, said he could not speculate whether the Defense Department had found more than just a single conversation between Clinton and Petraeus. We can only speak to the records in our possession, he said. ",politicsNews,"September 24, 2016 ",1
N.Y. Times endorses Clinton in White House race,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The New York Times endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for the White House on Saturday, saying she was more qualified than Republican presidential rival Donald Trump to handle the challenges facing the United States. The newspaper described Clinton as one of the most tenacious politicians of her generation and said she had displayed a command of policy and diplomatic nuance while building a reputation for grit and bipartisan cooperation. A lifetimes commitment to solving problems in the real world qualifies Hillary Clinton for this job, and the country should put her to work, the Times said of the former secretary of state and U.S. senator from New York. Clinton will face off against Trump on Monday night in the first of three presidential debates, with opinion polls showing her once sizable lead over the New York businessman narrowing amid continued public doubts about her trustworthiness. The Times said Clintons mistakes had distorted perceptions of her character, but praised her work restoring U.S. credibility in foreign affairs as secretary of state and on behalf of children, women and families throughout her career. Mrs. Clinton has shown herself to be a realist who believes America cannot simply withdraw behind oceans and walls, but must engage confidently in the world to protect its interests and be true to its values, the newspaper said. It said Clintons decision to use a private email server for government work as secretary of state deserved the scrutiny it has received in the campaign, but considered alongside the real challenges facing the United States it looks like a matter for the help desk. Viewed against those challenges, Trump shrinks to his true small-screen, reality-show proportions, the Times said, promising another editorial on Monday explaining why we believe Mr. Trump to be the worst nominee put forward by a major party in modern American history. The endorsement from the Times editorial board is no surprise. The last Republican the Times backed for the White House was President Dwight Eisenhower in 1956. But several newspapers with more conservative editorial boards, including the Dallas Morning News and Cincinnati Enquirer, also have recently endorsed Clinton. The Times said Clintons best argument for the White House was her ability to rise to the challenges facing the country. The 2016 campaign has brought to the surface the despair and rage of poor and middle-class Americans facing the burdens of recession, technological change, foreign competition and war, it said. Over 40 years in public life, Hillary Clinton has studied these forces and weighed responses to these problems. Our endorsement is rooted in respect for her intellect, experience, toughness and courage over a career of almost continuous public service, often as the first or only woman in the arena, the newspaper said.

Ohio system of purging inactive voters not legal: court,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Ohios practice of rescinding voter registrations from people who fail to cast ballots is illegal, a court ruled on Friday, the latest legal decision affecting voting rights ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8.  The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati reversed an earlier ruling by a federal judge in June and could lead to the reinstatement of thousands of voters in the politically crucial swing state of Ohio. We dont believe that any voters should be removed from the rolls simply because they havent voted in a few elections, said Mike Brickner, senior policy director at the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought a lawsuit against the practice along with other advocates. Voting rights cases have become pivotal battlegrounds in the lead-up to the hotly contested presidential vote between Democratic party candidate Hillary Clinton and her Republican counterpart Donald Trump.  The ACLU and others have challenged laws in Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina over voting rights issues. On Friday Texas asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate a law requiring authorized identification to be presented before a citizen may vote. At issue in the Ohio case is a policy of purging voters who  fail to cast ballots over a six-year period and do not respond to a letter from the state asking if they have moved.         A Reuters analysis showed that at least 144,000 voters had been removed from Ohios rolls since the last presidential election. In their lawsuit, the ACLU and other plaintiffs argued that the process violates federal voting rights law, which prohibits removing voters from the rolls simply because they have been inactive. In June, a federal judge disagreed, ruling that an exception in the law protected Ohios practice. But the appellate court said on Friday that because the removal process was triggered solely by someones failure to vote, it was not legal. The appeals court sent the case back to U.S. District Judge George C. Smith to consider possible remedies, including reinstating all voters removed under the process. Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, said the state would appeal if Smith orders all of the purged voters to be reinstated, arguing that would open the state to potential fraud by people impersonating voters who have died or moved away. This ruling overturns 20 years of Ohio law and practice, which has been carried out by the last four Secretaries of State, both Democrat and Republican, Husted said.

'Bridgegate' trial star witness describes favors for endorsements,"NEWARK, N.J. (Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christies office turned a regional transportation agency into a goodie bag from which to dole out favors and funds to Democrats who might endorse the Republican during his 2013 re-election campaign, according to prosecutors star witness in the so-called Bridgegate trial on Friday. David Wildstein, a former executive at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey who pleaded guilty and is testifying for the prosecution, described how requests from state officials went first to a top Christie aide for approval - for everything from patronage jobs at the agency to tours of the World Trade Center site, which the Port Authority owns. The aide, Christies then-deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly, and William Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority, are on trial for wire fraud and civil rights deprivation. Kelly and Baroni are accused of arranging in September 2013 to close traffic lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge in order to cause gridlock in Fort Lee, New Jersey, as retribution after the municipalitys Democratic mayor did not endorse Christies successful re-election bid. The scandal helped torpedo Christies bid for the Republican presidential nomination. At the start of the trial, federal prosecutors claimed for the first time that Christie knew his two close associates were involved in the shutdown. Christie has denied any knowledge of the plot. Wildstein said the goodie bag scheme allowed Christies office to take credit for items given by the Port Authority, a bi-state agency run jointly with New York. That was the system that was established. All use of Port Authority resources had to be approved by the governors office, Wildstein, 55, testified. The governors office was always to be the deliverer of good news. In one case, Wildstein had the 100 flags flown over the World Trade Center site on the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11  attacks shipped to the governors office after the ceremony to be distributed to local officials as it saw fit. The office considered whether officials were willing to endorse Christie when deciding how to hand out the flags, surplus equipment, and even local grant money, he said. Baroni, whom Wildstein described as one of the closest friends Ive ever had, hired Wildstein to be the bad cop in pushing Christies agenda at the authority, Wildstein said. If it was good for Christie then it was good for us, Wildstein said. Wildsteins testimony continues on Monday. ",politicsNews,"September 23, 2016 ",1

"As Syria cease-fire fails, Obama may leave successor 'problem from hell'","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States was relegated to the sidelines of the Syrian war on Friday as an all-out assault by Syrian government and Russian forces on opposition-held Aleppo threatened to unleash a new refugee wave and drive U.S.-backed rebels into the ranks of al Qaedas Syrian branch, U.S. officials and experts said. Moscows direct participation in the offensive left fading hope for U.S.-Russian peace efforts, raising the likelihood that U.S. President Barack Obamas successor will inherit a worsening conflict. Entering its sixth year, the Syrian civil war already has left some 250,000 people dead, uprooted more than 11 million and provided a base for Islamic State to launch and inspire attacks in the West. For the next president on Day One, this becomes the problem from hell, said Frederic Hof, a former Obama adviser on Syria who is now at the Atlantic Council think tank. Its a problem thats going to persist in one way or another throughout the first term of the next president and probably beyond. A U.S. official suggested White House plans to keep Syrian chaos under control as Obama leaves office have been upended. It was hoped that they could turn over a simmering mess to the next president, said a U.S. official. But what happened was that the simmering mess blew up and now they are going to have to figure out what to do. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Russian aircraft, long-range artillery and special forces advisers were directly participating with Syrian government forces in the drive to conquer eastern Aleppo, the largest urban stronghold of the U.S.-backed moderate opposition. Shiite militiamen from Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan also were involved in the assault on the devastated enclave, where an estimated 250,000 civilians were suffering the most intense airstrikes of the war, they said. The Russians are actively participating in the current offensive in Aleppo, said one U.S. official. It appears to be a no-holds barred attempt to crush the opposition.  Russian aircraft were flying sorties at the same rate  about 40 per day - as they were before Washington and Moscow negotiated a failed ceasefire between the Syria government and opposition forces in February, the officials said. Some U.S. intelligence officials believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is taking advantage of Obamas refusal to intervene militarily in Syria and his lame duck status to seize as much territory as possible before the new U.S. president takes office. These officials argue that Russia has not sincerely engaged in peace-making efforts and that Putin aims to weaken the opposition as rapidly as possible, a goal in which he is gradually succeeding. Damascus announced the offensive on Thursday as Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov failed to salvage a ceasefire that collapsed on Monday. The ceasefire was supposed to lead to U.S.-Russian cooperation on airstrikes against Islamic State and al Qaedas Syrian affiliate, formerly known as the Nusra Front. What course Obama will now take remained unclear. There doesnt seem to be a Plan B right now, Hof said. Obama has sought to restrict U.S. involvement in Syria, repeatedly rejecting proposals by advisers for actions such as establishing a no-fly zone or arming the moderate opposition fighting to topple President Bashar Assad. One of the things that haunts me the most was our failure to ask ourselves about the consequences of inaction, said one former senior official involved in Syria policy. We were always focused on the consequences of action ... But we should have also considered how doing nothing for several years might have an impact on U.S. credibility and the conflict more broadly. Obama has limited the U.S. role to supporting groups fighting Islamic State in northeastern Syria. He has pursued  talks with Russia, which intervened on Assads behalf in September 2015, on a peace accord between U.S.-backed moderate rebels and Damascus. Obama, however, no longer can count on securing a ceasefire that will keep a lid on the crisis until his successor is sworn-in on Jan. 20, experts said. Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute think tank said he doubted that Obama would adopt a more robust policy. Given the posture the Obama administration has developed with regards to how it faces the war in Syria, I dont see it shifting the strategy, he said. That would be the most extraordinary foreign policy shift in the last eight years. Obama, however, faces the prospect of a deepening humanitarian disaster, officials and experts said. The fall of Aleppo could unleash a new wave of migrants fleeing toward Europe, which has been struggling since last year to accommodate more than 1 million refugees. Moreover, U.S.-backed rebels, dismayed over what they saw as Obamas abandonment of Aleppo, could begin joining al Qaedas Syrian branch. It is widely regarded as the most effective opposition group and has vehemently rejected a negotiated settlement with Assad, U.S. officials and experts said. Lister, who maintains contacts with rebels inside Syria, said opposition leaders are growing disillusioned with U.S. efforts to negotiate a diplomatic solution with Assads main military backer. Things are deteriorating so quickly now. The U.S. is losing leverage on the ground every week, he said.      ",politicsNews,"September 23, 2016 ",1
"Obama vetoes Sept. 11 Saudi bill, sets up showdown with Congress","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Friday vetoed legislation allowing families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia, which could prompt Congress to overturn his decision with a rare veto override, the first of his presidency. Obama said the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act would hurt U.S. national security and harm important alliances, while shifting crucial terrorism-related issues from policy officials into the hands of the courts. The bill passed the Senate and House of Representatives in reaction to long-running suspicions, denied by Saudi Arabia, that hijackers of the four U.S. jetliners that attacked the United States in 2001 were backed by the Saudi government. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals. Obama said other countries could use the law, known as JASTA, as an excuse to sue U.S. diplomats, members of the military or companies - even for actions of foreign organizations that had received U.S. aid, equipment or training. Removing sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated as state sponsors of terrorism, based solely on allegations that such foreign governments actions abroad had a connection to terrorism-related injuries on U.S. soil, threatens to undermine these longstanding principles that protect the United States, our forces, and our personnel, Obama said in a statement. Senator Chuck Schumer, who co-wrote the legislation and has championed it, immediately made clear how difficult it will be for Obama to sustain the veto. Schumer, the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate, issued a statement within moments of receiving the veto, promising that it would be swiftly and soundly overturned. He represents New York, home of most of the Sept. 11 victims. Both the Democratic and Republican candidates for president, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, said they would have signed the bill into law if they were in the White House. If two-thirds of the lawmakers in both the Senate and House vote to override, the law would stand, the first such override since he became president in 2009, and possibly the last.  Obama leaves office in January. Fridays veto was the twelfth of his presidency. An override has been expected, despite some lawmakers saying they had doubts about the measure. In a letter seen by Reuters on Friday, Republican Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the powerful House Armed Services Committee, said he would oppose the override. My primary concern is that this bill increases the risk posed to American military and intelligence personnel, diplomats and others serving our country around the world, Thornberry wrote in a letter encouraging his fellow Republicans to sustain the veto. House Speaker Paul Ryan said Wednesday he thought there were enough votes to override a veto, but had concerns. I worry about trial lawyers trying to get rich off of this. And I do worry about the precedent, he told reporters. The 9/11 Families & Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism group, which has pressed Congress to uphold the legislation, called Obamas veto explanation unconvincing and unsupportable. The Saudi government has lobbied heavily to stop the bill,  the European Union has formally opposed it and Gulf States have condemned it. Major U.S. corporations such as General Electric and Dow Chemical have also pressed lawmakers to reconsider. The bill is not balanced, sets a dangerous precedent, and has real potential to destabilize vital bilateral relationships and the global economy, GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who supports the bill.

"In Trump/Clinton face-off on Monday, winning over women will be key","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton face off in their first presidential debate together on Monday, they will have their best chance yet to win over the roughly 27 million Americans who have yet to decide who to vote for. In some ways, this group looks like a typical Trump supporter: they are mainly white, without college degrees, older, and frustrated by the status quo. But while Trumps supporters are mostly men, Americas uncommitted voters are mostly women, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. With polls showing a close fight between Trump and Hillary, this is a group that could decide the election.  Katie Packer, a Republican strategist who served as a top aide to Mitt Romney in 2012 said polls show that many undecided women have been put off by Trumps inflammatory rhetoric, while others see Clinton, the first female presidential candidate from a major U.S. party, as dishonest. These are the same women who dont trust Hillary and think shes phony, she said. But Trump is scary to them.  Roughly 20 percent of Americas likely voters are still on the fence, compared to just 12 percent at the same time in the 2012 election, underscoring the unpopularity of both Trump and Clinton.  Some 77 percent of them think the country is on the wrong track, which puts them more in line with Trump supporters than Clinton backers. They are also similar in age to many Trump backers: some 54 percent are at least 55 years old. And 67 percent never earned a college degree, compared with 71 percent for Trump supporters and 56 percent for Clinton supporters. Gender-wise, they track more closely with Clintons base. Some 60 percent are women. Trumps base is made up of about 48 percent women, compared with 52 percent for Clinton. The most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found Clinton leading Trump by 4 percentage points in a two-way race. The Democratic nominee has mostly led Trump in the poll this year, but the gap between the two candidates has narrowed with six weeks left before the Nov. 8 election.  With neither candidate a clear favorite on issues like creating jobs or keeping the nation safe, nearly a third of uncommitted voters said they may be more likely to vote for a third-party candidate than for either Clinton or Trump. One of the most important issues in this election is just making sure that our country has a future both through education and jobs, said undecided voter Erika Szotek, 43, of Hanover Park, Illinois, who voted for Romney in 2012. She said she thought Trumps flamboyancy is going to get the country into a lot of trouble with other countries. But she isnt sold on Clinton either. There are some things I just dont trust about her.  Women have been a lingering problem for Trump, whose unfiltered speaking style and fiery rhetoric on immigration and security have put many off. He has also gotten into trouble for some remarks he has made about women. He was widely criticized for saying Fox News host Megyn Kelly had blood coming out of her wherever, a comment many interpreted as referring to her menstruating, although he insisted that was not what he meant.  He has also called television personality Rosie ODonnell a fat pig and made fun of former presidential rival and ex-Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorinas face, saying, Would anyone vote for that? Clintons campaign has seized on the vulnerability. This week it launched an ad titled Mirrors that shows images of girls looking in mirrors while recordings of Trump comment on womens weight and breast size, calling them slob, pig, and fat.   But Clinton has her own troubles. Multiple polls show that her use of a private email server without approval while secretary of state has deepened voters mistrust of her even though she has since acknowledged it was a mistake. Trump frequently calls her Crooked Hillary. FBI director James Comey recommended in July that no criminal charges be brought against Clinton for her handling of classified information while she was secretary of state, but he called her use of the server extremely careless.  Ruth Hammett, 77, of Kingsland, Georgia, said she would be looking to the debates for guidance on which candidate to support. She is leaning toward Clinton but wants to hear both candidates address national security.  Im very scared, most so for my kids and my grandkids, Hammett said. Im scared to death.

"Long a rival, Ted Cruz endorses Trump in U.S. presidential race","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In an abrupt shift, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz endorsed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Friday, saying he is the only candidate who can stop Democrat Hillary Clinton from winning the White House on Nov. 8. A year ago, I pledged to endorse the Republican nominee, and I am honoring that commitment. And if you dont want to see a Hillary Clinton presidency, I encourage you to vote for him, the former Republican presidential candidate said in a lengthy statement. Cruz, a senator from Texas who is a favorite of the conservative Tea Party movement, was one of Trumps last challengers for the Republican presidential nomination to drop out of the race. When Cruz addressed the Republican National Convention in July in Cleveland, where Trump accepted the nomination, he declined to endorse Trump and was essentially booed off stage by the New York businessmans supporters. During the heated primary battle, Trump had insulted Cruzs wife, Heidi, for her physical appearance. His wild suggestion that the senators father was linked to President John F. Kennedys assassin prompted Cruz to denounce Trump as a pathological liar. In July, Trump said, I dont want his endorsement. On Friday he said he was greatly honored to have Cruz backing him. We have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent. I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again, Trump said. Cruz cited the possibility of Democrats taking control of the U.S. Supreme Court as a major reason why he decided to drop his opposition to Trump. Trump earlier in the day released the names of 21 prominent conservatives and said he would pick from this list in nominating a replacement for conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February. The Senate has refused to take any action on President Barack Obamas nomination of Merrick Garland, chief judge of the federal appeals court in Washington, to fill the vacancy. One of the names on Trumps list was that of U.S. Senator Mike Lee of Utah, a key ally of Cruz. Cruz said that for some time he had been seeking greater specificity on Trumps views toward filling the opening on the court, which is currently deadlocked between four right-leaning and four left-leaning jurists. He said Trumps list provides a serious reason for voters to choose to support Trump and that Lee would make an extraordinary justice. Cruz noted his qualms about Trump, saying, I have struggled to determine the right course of action in this general election. But in the end, he decided, Trump is the only thing standing in the way of a Clinton presidency that he said would be devastating to the United States. ",politicsNews,"September 23, 2016 ",1
Clinton leads Trump by 4 points ahead of first presidential debate: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton had a four-percentage point advantage in support over Republican Donald Trump ahead of their first U.S. presidential debate, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll released on Friday. The Sept. 16-22 opinion poll showed that 41 percent of likely voters supported Clinton, while 37 percent supported Trump. Clinton has mostly led Trump in the poll during the 2016 campaign, though her advantage has narrowed since the end of the Democratic and Republican national conventions in July. With just six weeks before the Nov. 8 election, Mondays debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York will be the first of three between the White House rivals. It presents a major opportunity for them to appeal to voters who have yet to commit to a candidate after a mostly negative race in which Clinton and Trump have sought to brand each other as untrustworthy and dangerous for the country. The live, televised matchup is expected to draw a Super Bowl-sized television audience of 100 million Americans, according to some commentators. Among those watching will be people who so far remain on the fence. This could be a sizable group: Some 22 percent of likely voters said in the latest poll that they do not support either major-party candidate. That was more than twice the proportion of uncommitted voters at the same point in the 2012 election between Democratic President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney. These uncommitted voters appear to be leaning more toward Trump than Clinton, according to the latest poll, though they have not been convinced enough to say they will vote for him in November. It was also possible that some of these voters would pick an alternative-party candidate like Libertarian Gary Johnson or the Green Partys Jill Stein. Clinton led a separate four-way poll that included Trump, Johnson and Stein. Among likely voters, 39 percent supported Clinton, 37 percent favored Trump, 7 percent picked Johnson and 2 percent supported Stein. The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English in the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii. It included 1,559 respondents who were considered to be likely voters given their voting history, registration status and stated intention to show up on Election Day. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points, meaning results could vary by that much either way. National polls have produced varying measurements of support for Clinton and Trump during the 2016 campaign. The differences are partly due to the fact that some polls, like Reuters/Ipsos, try to include only likely voters, while others include all registered voters. The Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll gathers responses every day and reports results twice a week, so it often detects trends in sentiment before most other polls.  Polling aggregators, which calculate averages of major polls, have shown that Clintons lead over Trump has been shrinking this month. The most recent individual polls put her advantage at 3 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"September 23, 2016 ",1
"White House, government agencies discuss possible shutdown","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House budget office scheduled a call with U.S government agencies on Friday to plan for a government shutdown in case the U.S. Congress fails to pass a short-term funding bill by a deadline next week. It is our hope that this work will ultimately be unnecessary and that there will be no lapse in appropriations, a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) said in a statement. The federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30 and Congress must pass a spending measure by then to keep the government open.  In recent years, lawmakers have seldom agreed on a full federal budget and instead have relied on stop-gap measures. On Thursday, Republicans produced a bill which Democrats immediately rejected. The Senate is expected to hold an initial procedural vote on the legislation on Tuesday, according to a senior Republican aide.  The White House was pleased that bill includes funding to fight the Zika virus, but has concerns about other provisions, spokesman Josh Earnest said, noting that it was too soon to panic about the bill. I think it is unclear at best right now whether or not this particular piece of legislation will pass both houses of Congress and make its way to the presidents desk. Even if it were, its also unclear at best right now if the president would sign it, Earnest told reporters. The OMB said there was enough time for Congress to pass a short-term funding bill, but prudent management requires that the government plan for the possibility of a lapse. Republicans and Democrats annually fight about spending bills but normally reach a deal to avert a shutdown, particularly during election years. In 2013, the two sides failed to agree, and the government stopped operations for 16 days. ",politicsNews,"September 23, 2016 ",1

Most Clinton emails to be released after election: WSJ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Most of the emails the FBI recovered during its investigation of Hillary Clintons use of a private email system while secretary of state will not be made available until after the Nov. 8 presidential election under a timetable set by a judge on Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported. The judge ordered the U.S. State Department to finish processing 1,050 pages of material for release by Nov. 4, just days before Americans go to the polls, the Wall Street Journal said. The paper said that material was out of what could be as much as 10,000 pages. Under the schedule set by the judge, there will be also be pre-election releases on Oct. 7 and Oct. 21, and the State Department will process 500 pages per month after that, the Wall Street Journal reported. The State Department is responding to dozens of lawsuits brought over Clintons use of a private, home-based email system while she was the agencys top diplomat from 2009 to 2013. The timetable announced on Friday was in a lawsuit brought by Judicial Watch, a conservative group that has filed multiple lawsuits to obtain government records related to Clintons tenure as secretary of state. The State Department voluntarily agreed to produce to Judicial Watch any emails sent or received by Secretary Clinton in her official capacity during her tenure as Secretary of State which are contained within the material turned over by the FBI, agency spokesman John Kirby said in a statement.

Anti-Trump campaigners tear down cardboard wall at Brandenburg Gate,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Activists from the online campaign group Avaaz tore down a cardboard wall near the site of the former Berlin Wall on Friday to urge American expats in Germany to vote against Republican nominee Donald Trump in the U.S. election on Nov. 8. Many identify Trump with his proposal to build a huge border wall between the United States and Mexico to keep migrants out; moreover, the event was staged in front of the Brandenburg Gate, near the place where U.S. president Ronald Reagan publicly urged Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987 to tear down this wall. Holding red and blue placards saying Stop Trump and Tear Down Trumps Wall, dozens of cheering activists toppled the 2.5 meter (8.2 foot) structure, emblazoned with a picture of Trump, with their hands and rubber mallets. Many of the 150 or so onlookers chanted The wall must come down! as it was knocked over.  Around 8 million Americans live abroad but only 12 percent of them voted in the 2012 election, Avaaz said in a statement. Americans abroad are the Swing State that nobody knows about, who could, however, decide the vote this year. A large number of them live in Germany, said Emma Ruby-Sachs, deputy director of Avaaz.

Trump names Cruz ally Mike Lee as possible Supreme Court justice,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump on Friday named U.S. Senator Mike Lee as a potential Supreme Court nominee, turning to an ally of former rival Ted Cruz in an apparent gesture to conservative Republicans who have been wary of the Republican presidential candidate.  Lee was included on a new list of 21 potential Supreme Court justices that Trump would consider for the high court if he is elected over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. This list is definitive and I will choose only from it in picking future justices of the United States Supreme Court, Trump said in a statement. The announcement came out on a day in which neither candidate had a public event and were preparing for Mondays first presidential debate. The list Trump announced included 10 new names and 11 conservative jurists from a list the New York businessman had announced in May. Lees brother, Thomas Lee, an associate justice of the Utah Supreme Court, was on the initial list and remains on Trumps expanded list. Trumps listing of Mike Lee amounted to a gesture to U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas, a conservative who fought Trump fiercely as a rival for the Republican presidential nomination and who has refused to endorse Trump. Trumps bombastic style and proposals breaking with some conservative orthodoxies such as support for free trade agreements have sparked unease among traditional conservative Republicans.  Mike Lee, in a statement, said he appreciated being considered. Right now Im focused on my job in the Senate, where Im in a good position to defend the Constitution by fighting against government overreach. Both lists that Ive seen from the Trump campaign are fantastic.  While my brother and I might disagree as to which list is better, theyre both great, he quipped. The death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on Feb. 13 left the court with a four-to-four tie between right-leaning and left-leaning justices. Democratic President Barack Obama has nominated Merrick Garland, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, but the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate has refused to consider confirming him. Trump said his list was based on who would follow constitutional principles on the high court. The possibility of Republicans ceding control of the court to the Democrats has been one of his main rallying cries at campaign events. Others on Trumps list include Keith Blackwell, a justice on the Supreme Court of Georgia; Charles Canady, a Florida Supreme Court justice; Neil Gorsuch, a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, and Edward Mansfield, an Iowa Supreme Court justice. Other names included Federico Moreno, a judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida; Margaret Ryan, a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces; Amul Thapar, a judge of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky; Timothy Tymkovich, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit; and Robert Young, chief justice of the Supreme Court of Michigan.

Trump doubles down on 'law-and-order' appeal in White House bid,"PITTSBURGH (Reuters) - Donald Trump on Thursday praised aggressive police tactics and condemned attacks on officers amid criticism of his plan to use stop-and-frisk tactics to reduce crime, in a speech following a second night of unrest that shook Charlotte, North Carolina. The Republican presidential nominee said drugs were a very, very big factor in urban unrest and that those suffering the most from the violence were law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration, Trump told an energy conference in Pittsburgh, as a room full of natural gas and coal industry executives listened in silence. The violence against our citizens, and our law enforcement, must be brought to an end, he added. Trump has portrayed himself as the law-and-order candidate. Stop-and-frisk, in which police stop, question and search pedestrians for weapons or contraband, has drawn protests and successful legal challenges because it is seen as unfairly targeting minorities. At the same time, Trump has recently reached out to African-American voters as the gap in many opinion polls has narrowed between him and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. Clinton, who did not immediately respond to Trumps remarks on Thursday, has pushed for stricter gun controls to help rein in gun violence and called for the development of national guidelines on the use of force by police officers. In Pittsburgh, Trump, a New York businessman, called for better training of police and more community engagement. If youre not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what youre watching on television at night, Trump said. My administration will work with local communities and local officials to make the reduction of crime a top priority. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said later in a statement that Trumps comments were not referring specifically to the violence in Charlotte, but addressing a major concern that authorities and moms across the country are raising with him, which is indiscriminate drug use and opiate addiction. The fatal police shooting of a black man sparked the protests in Charlotte, and a state of emergency was declared on Wednesday.  There have also been protests in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in recent days after a fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man who a video showed had his hands in clear view at the time. A white Tulsa officer was charged with first-degree manslaughter on Thursday in the shooting. Police tactics and deadly encounters with African-Americans, many of them unarmed, have sparked protests and unrest across the country in recent years.  Clinton said on Wednesday that the deaths in Charlotte and Tulsa added two more names to the list of African-American victims of police killings. Its unbearable, and it needs to become intolerable, she said. Trump was at an African-American church in Cleveland on Wednesday when he praised stop-and-frisk, which had triggered protests and court rulings that it was unconstitutional or required outside monitoring in cities like New York, Chicago and Newark, New Jersey. Before going to Pittsburgh, Trump was asked on Fox News Fox and Friends program to define the tactic. He said: If they see a person possibly with a gun or they think may have a gun, they will see the person and theyll look and theyll take the gun away. Theyll stop, theyll frisk, and theyll take the gun away. And they wont have anything to shoot with, he said. In Washington, White House spokesman John Earnest pointed to what he said was a contradiction in Trumps remarks. It does raise questions that a politician would be so dogmatic about protecting Second Amendment rights (to bear arms) yet rather cavalier about protecting the constitutional prohibition against illegal search and seizure, he told a news briefing. While Trump did not mention stop-and-frisk by name in Pittsburgh, he used the speech to repeat his praise for the policing tactics fostered by former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, now a major Trump supporter, who promoted the practice. Trump again credited policing under the Republican mayor with reducing crime in the candidates hometown. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio rejected that argument on Thursday, warning Trump against embracing a tactic that would  worsen relations between police and the minority community. De Blasio attributed the sharp drop in crime to another strategy adopted by Bill Bratton, the citys longtime police commissioner, who retired less than a week ago. Bratton championed the broken windows policing strategy that emphasizes pursuit of crimes no matter how minor. In his resignation letter, he attributed the decline in crime in New York, the nations most populous city with 8.5 million people, to additional officers and an emphasis on building bonds within neighborhoods.  De Blasio, who supports Clinton, said in an interview with CNN that Trump should really be careful because if we reinstitute stop-and-frisk all over this country, you would see a lot more tension between police and community.

Trump says he would push universities to reduce tuition,"CHESTER TOWNSHIP, Pa. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Thursday he would work with U.S. lawmakers if elected to tie federal funding and tax breaks for colleges and universities to a good faith commitment by them to lower tuition costs for students. If universities want access to all of these federal tax breaks and tax dollars paid for by you, Trump told a rally in a Philadelphia suburb, they have to make good faith efforts to reduce the cost of college. Trump did not offer specifics on how he would tie federal funding to changes in college tuition.  His Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, has proposed making in-state tuition for colleges and universities free immediately for families earning $85,000 or less, and free by 2021 for families making up to $125,000 a year.  Trump, a New York businessman, has not said much about the cost of college while campaigning. But U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who competed against Clinton for the Democratic nomination, made government-funded college tuition central to his campaign platform.  Sanders drew a great deal of support from the youngest group of American voters, and Trump, who needs to win over more women and young people before the Nov. 8 election, took up a similar theme in his proposal. U.S. student debt has surged about 24 percent to around $1.2 trillion since 2012, according to figures earlier this year from the New York Federal Reserve, leaving many graduates with mortgage-sized tabs before they enter the workforce.

Hillary Clinton spars with comedian on parody talk-show interview,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton played it strictly deadpan while parrying decidedly off-the-wall questions from comedian Zach Galifianakis on his online parody talk show, Between Two Ferns, released on Thursday.  Galifianakis, star of The Hangover films, is known for his cringe-inducing banter on the web program, asking subjects awkward questions. Past interview subjects include Brad Pitt, Charlize Theron, Bradley Cooper and President Barack Obama. Sitting between two fern plants on a sparse set, Galifianakis did not dial back his trademark style of appearing uninterested and unprepared as he interviewed Clinton, riffing on her previous role as U.S. secretary of state in Obamas first term.  As secretary, how many words per minute could you type? And how does President Obama like his coffee? Like himself - weak? Galifianakis said. You know Zach, those are really out-of-date questions. You need to get out more, Clinton responded. Other topics brought up included the comedians interest in the designer of Clintons signature pantsuits and whether her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, discussed romantic crushes with Ivanka Trump, daughter of Clintons Republican opponent, Donald Trump, in the Nov. 8 election. In closing, Galifianakis made a wry reference to Clintons use of a private email server during her tenure as Americas top diplomat, which was investigated by the FBI. This has been a lot of fun, Mrs. Clinton. We should stay in touch. Whats the best way to reach you? E-mail? As a poker-faced Clinton looked on, Galifianakis hit a button to play AOLs famous email alert: Youve got mail. ",politicsNews,"September 22, 2016 ",1
Trump praises 'stop-and-frisk' police tactic,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, in remarks at an African-American church on Wednesday, praised stop-and-frisk policing methods that have aroused protests and successful legal challenges, for singling out minorities. The anti-crime tactic in which police stop, question and search pedestrians for weapons or contraband, gained traction in New York City under Mayor Rudy Giuliani, now a top Trump supporter. But opposition to the practice led police departments in New York, as well as Chicago and Newark, New Jersey, to agree to cut back on its use, in some cases submitting to outside monitoring and improving police training. I would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to, Trump said, according to excerpts of a Fox News town hall in Cleveland, after a listener asked what he would do to reduce crime in predominantly black communities across the nation. I see whats going on here, I see whats going on in Chicago, I think stop-and-frisk. In New York City it was so incredible, the way it worked, he added.   Ending the practice in New York was a key plank of Democrat Bill de Blasios successful 2013 run for mayor. As the race between Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton tightens ahead of the Nov. 8 election, he has been reaching out to African-American voters, shown by opinion polls to largely favor Clinton. Trump has portrayed himself as the law-and-order candidate. But Clinton has criticized many of his proposals as unconstitutional attacks on American freedoms. Clintons campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trumps statement. Stop and frisk had saved lives and reduced crime in New York City under Giuliani, the Trump campaign said in a statement. Mr. Trump believes that a locally tailored version of stop and frisk should be used in Chicago to help reduce skyrocketing violence and make our Chicago safe again, spokesman Jason Miller said. Anger over police tactics has risen as their fatal encounters with African-Americans, many of them unarmed, have sparked protests and unrest across the country. In his appeal to African-American voters, Trump has lamented the woes of black communities, asking those who traditionally vote Democratic to take a chance on him. But his often dire portrayals of their lives have left some black voters unmoved.    Connie Tucker, a pastor at Father Heart Ministries in Columbus, Ohio, said she liked policies that brought results, so if stop-and-frisk helped cut crime, she backed it. But Tucker, who is white, said she sensed discomfort in the room at Trumps remarks. I felt like there was a pause, she said.      Another attendee, Geoff Betts, 38, who is black, said he felt dismayed by Trumps response. Betts, a hair products distributor, said he was registered to vote as an independent and attended to learn how Trump would try to win over black voters.  He said he thought police unfairly discriminated against black citizens and that he opposed stop-and-frisk. We are victims, he said, adding that he had walked out of the meeting. I just couldnt take it anymore, I had to go. I dont think that Donald Trump gets it. ",politicsNews,"September 21, 2016 ",1
California ballot has record number of local revenue measures,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A record number of local tax and bond measures will fill the California ballot this November, including over $32 billion of proposed funding for education, infrastructure and homeless services. Some 650 local measures will go before voters, including 427 revenue measures. That is considerably more than the number proposed during any of the last five gubernatorial or presidential elections, according to data compiled by the local government finance consulting firm CaliforniaCityFinance.com. Previously, the most measure-packed election was in November 2014, with 268 local revenue measures. California is one of 24 states that allow initiative rights to its citizens. Voter-approved measures are used to raise revenues for specific construction projects, change tax policy, or create new laws.      In the Golden State and nationwide, a boom in bond proposals  follows years of federal cutbacks to state and local programs, continued low interest rates and years of unmet infrastructure needs. The largest monetary requests by local municipalities in California include $3.5 billion for the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), $1.2 billion for Los Angeles homeless housing and services, and $950 million for affordable housing in Santa Clara County. There are 184 local measures to fund public school and community college projects, totaling more than $25 billion.  Michael Coleman, head of CaliforniaCityFinance.com, said the surge in education bond measures coincides with statewide Proposition 51, which authorizes $9 billion in general obligation bonds for public school facilities. Proposition 55 aims to increase education funding by extending upper income tax rates. Theres a lot of folks that think this is the time to go for a new school bond, said Coleman. They see it as a synchronous message, and time to get in line for matching funds. The Nov. 8 election is a focus for statewide propositions as well. There are 17 in total, regarding issues ranging from marijuana legalization to the public cost of prescription drugs, tobacco taxes and the death penalty.  The surge of ballot measures comes during an election year in which the presidential race is sure to draw large crowds to voting booths. There is also the lingering effect of low voter turnout during the November 2014 election that reduced the signature threshold for a proposition to qualify.  Across the country, 74 citizen-initiated measures fill state ballots, more than double the number certified in 2014, according to Natalie Cohen, senior analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. Growing populist sentiment and frustration with traditional government contributed to the groundswell, Cohen wrote in a recent report about upcoming ballot measures. In California, some local measures are reactive to state propositions. For example, Proposition 64 aims to legalize recreational cannabis, and 37 local measures would create marijuana taxes for local cities and counties.  Thirteen countywide measures would fund transportation improvements. Thats coming from an acknowledged, pent-up demand for badly needed infrastructure repairs, Coleman said. Eighty-eight measures would increase or extend local sale taxes. Another 39 support parcel taxes for road improvements, fire and emergency services, hospitals and police. Parcel taxes are flat taxes on properties that originated after Proposition 13 severely limited property taxes in 1978.  Three Bay Area measures would tax sugary beverages.

Clinton proposes 65 percent tax on U.S. billionaire estates,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Thursday proposed raising taxes on inherited property to 65 percent for the largest estates as she bolstered plans for tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans. Known by conservative opponents as the death tax, the estate tax, levied on property such as cash, real estate, stock or other assets transferred from deceased persons to heirs, currently is imposed only on inherited assets worth $5.45 million or more for an individual. Clintons plan, posted on her campaigns website, would raise the estate tax from the current 40 percent to 45 percent, the rate that existed in 2009. But the biggest estates would face rates of up to 65 percent for property valued at more than  $500 million for a single person or $1 billion per couple, under her proposal, an update of an earlier plan. Clintons proposed top rate of 65 percent would be the highest estate tax since the 1980s, and is in line with a proposal made during the Democratic primaries by her former rival for the partys presidential nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders.  Her campaign said the boosted estate tax and a change in the rules to tax capital gains associated with inherited assets would help pay for other proposals to benefit middle-class people, such as expanding a tax credit for working parents. Clintons campaign said the plan would hit only the wealthiest people.  Hillary Clinton has made a commitment throughout this campaign to make sure there is a plan to pay for the progressive policies we have laid out, said Mike Shapiro, an economic adviser to Clinton.  The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group focused on budget issues, said Clintons new tax proposals including the estate tax changes, taxes on capital gains of inherited assets and other provisions would together raise $260 billion in revenue over a decade. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, a wealthy real estate developer, wants to eliminate the estate tax. Clintons proposal prompted criticism from conservatives ahead of her first debate with Trump on Monday night at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, issued a statement decrying Clintons dramatic hike in the death tax. Republicans want to eliminate estate taxes altogether because they believe the system penalizes families who want to pass down businesses, said U.S. Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the tax-writing House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee. Brady said in a statement that Clintons plan was dead on arrival. The nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said this month that only the estates of the wealthiest 0.2 percent of Americans, about two out of every 1,000 people who die, currently owe any estate tax because the first $5.45 million per person is exempt. Clinton would lower that exemption to $3.5 million. ",politicsNews,"September 22, 2016 ",1
Trump vs. Clinton: Debate will mark biggest moment of election,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton, suddenly vulnerable in the presidential race, is under pressure to deliver a strong performance against Republican Donald Trump in their first debate on Monday, a moment that could be the most consequential yet of the 2016 election. Political veterans involved in preparing for past presidential debates said Clinton should drive home how she would run the country during uncertain times and draw a contrast as the steady, experienced alternative to the untested Trump. For his part, Trump needed to show enough gravitas to convince skeptics that he is ready to be commander in chief, they said. The 90-minute face-off at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, the first of three debates, takes place at a time when Clintons once-comfortable lead in opinion polls over the former reality TV star has evaporated. History shows that a single bad debate performance can alter the trajectory of a U.S. presidential race.  Reuters/Ipsos polling shows about 20 percent of the electorate remains undecided, far higher at this stage in the campaign than the 12 percent undecided four years ago.  The TV audience for the debate is expected to be a record, easily surpassing the record 46.2 million households who watched the first encounter between President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, according to the Nielsen ratings company.     I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and the bigotry that we have seen coming from my opponent, Clinton said on Tuesday on the Steve Harvey Radio show. Anita Dunn, who helped President Barack Obama prepare for debates against Republican nominee John McCain in 2008, said Obama succeeded at their first debate by steering the conversation repeatedly back to the struggling U.S. economy even though the event was supposed to be about foreign policy. She said she expected Clinton to try to exploit Trumps weaknesses and emphasize her strengths. The contrast between them is what you want to hone, she said. The debate will be the best opportunity for two candidates, both widely seen by voters as untrustworthy, to put to rest questions about their fitness for the White House with the Nov. 8 election fast approaching. Even the candidates body language will be closely scrutinized, just as it has been in past elections. Brett ODonnell, a debate coach who helped President George W. Bush in his 2004 debates and McCain in 2008, said Bush did not put in the necessary work for his first debate against Democrat John Kerry that year and it showed. Quickly put on the defensive, Bush blinked rapidly and slouched behind the lectern. Kerry was judged the winner. Bush got more serious about the debates after that, ODonnell said. Clinton had a shaky performance at a Sept. 7 NBC Commander-in-Chief forum where she became prickly in response to questions about her handling of classified emails while serving as U.S. secretary of state. Presentation is very important, and Hillary has to work on that. Her presentation at the Commander-in-Chief forum was not very good. She didnt come off as likeable. She came off as sour and defensive, ODonnell said. Clinton is spending most of this week in debate preparations with a small circle of top aides at her home in Chappaqua, New York. Clinton aides said she is preparing for two scenarios: One in which Trump is measured and serious, and another in which he is freewheeling and makes inflammatory personal attacks. Trump relied on his famed spontaneity to fire off one-line zingers to dismantle 16 Republican rivals during the primaries, dispatching low-energy Jeb Bush or lying Ted Cruz and little Marco Rubio. He has repeatedly called Clinton crooked Hillary at rallies. Youre just not sure who is going to show up, said Jennifer Palmieri, a senior adviser to Clinton. He may be aggressive or he may lay back. Thats hard to game out necessarily so I would say most of the focus is on what points does she want to make. A Trump supporter, Republican U.S. Representative Chris Collins of New York, said Trump understands that he needs to put forth a presidential demeanor. I think the seriousness of that cant be understated and that were going to see the debate prep making sure that shes not going to be able to pull him somehow off the message, he said. Rick Lazio, a Republican former congressman from New York, found Clinton a tough opponent when he faced her in a U.S. Senate debate in New York in 2000. He was seen as bullying, lost the debate and the election, and now says Trump will need to treat Clinton carefully. What he has to avoid is a sense that he is name-calling, highly disrespectful, badgering, anything like that, he said. ROLE-PLAYING Former Republican Senator Judd Gregg, who played Democrats Al Gore and John Kerry in George W. Bushs mock debate sessions in 2000 and 2004, said Bush began preparing in early June unbeknownst to the news media and for a while did two practice sessions a day. For that reason, he said, he suspects Trump is doing more preparation work than he lets on. I have to believe he is doing something because it would be foolish to go in there and not practice at hearing lines, he said. A Republican source close to the campaign said former Fox News Chief Executive Roger Ailes has been coaching Trump but that the former reality TV star does not want to be over-prepared. Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Trump is preparing for the debates but theres nobody whos playing the role of Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump prepares for everything that he does, he said.

Presidential debate could score Super Bowl-sized audience,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Live, unscripted and unpredictable, the first 2016 U.S. presidential debate on Monday is expected to set new television audience records, with some commentators forecasting Super Bowl-sized viewership of around 100 million Americans.  The face-off between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton at Hofstra University in the New York City suburb of Hempstead will be carried across multiple U.S. broadcast and cable networks without commercial breaks for 90 minutes. Political and media experts say the extraordinary nature of the campaign, featuring Trump, the outspoken N.Y. businessman and former reality TV star, vying for votes with Clinton, the former U.S. secretary of state and first woman to run for the White House, is expected to break the record TV audience of 80 million for the 1980 debate between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, according to Nielsen. My prediction is a 100 million audience, and maybe more, said Paul Levinson, a communications professor at New Yorks Fordham University and author of McLuhan in an Age of Social Media. The Super Bowl shows that when there is something that is really special, something that can command peoples interest, something you want to see on a big screen, television has this enormous power and reach, Levinson said. The National Football Leagues annual Super Bowl is the most watched television event of the year in the United States, with the 2015 game holding the record of 115 million viewers. The 1983 finale of comedy series M*A*S*H holds the record for a non-sporting event with 105 million viewers, per Nielsen. This years Academy Awards ceremony was watched by just 34 million Americans.  The optimistic predictions for Mondays debate are fueled by the primaries record audience of 24 million for the first Republican primary debate in August 2015 that was attributed to Trumps presence. Alan Schroeder, author of Presidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trail, said an audience of 100 million seemed possible, especially given Trumps wild-card nature. Normally we see candidates in very choreographed settings, and in situations where they are fully in control. (In the debates) they have to give that up and that makes it attractive to viewers - the sense of danger, of not knowing how it will play. Add in the media hype with cable news channels showing count-down windows days in advance, and the first debate becomes must-see TV. Schroeder, a journalism professor at Bostons Northeastern University, compared the allure of Trump versus Clinton to the 2008 vice presidential debate between Republican Sarah Palin and Democrat Joe Biden. At 69.9 million U.S. viewers, it ranks as the second most viewed campaign debate ever. Palin was also a really compelling TV figure and had that same sense of danger around her, he said.  Mondays debate will be broadcast at the same time as the popular Monday Night Football on ESPN, but Levinson doubted it would make a big dent in the debate audience. Its not a crucial game, its not a Super Bowl, its not a playoff ... I think most football fans will feel they can afford to miss this game, Levinson said. ",politicsNews,"September 22, 2016 ",1
Senate splits over bill to avoid government shutdown,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A behind-the-scenes congressional battle to avoid a U.S. government shutdown broke into public view on Thursday when Republicans produced a stop-gap funding bill that Democrats immediately rejected. The federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30 and Congress must pass a spending measure by then to keep the government open. In recent years, lawmakers have seldom been able to agree on a full federal budget and instead have relied on stop-gap measures. Senate Majority Mitch McConnell capped weeks of labored negotiations by proposing a continuing resolution that would fund government agencies from Oct. 1 through Dec. 9 at an annual rate of just over $1 trillion.  The measure also includes $1.1 billion to combat the spreading Zika virus, $500 million in flood relief for states including Louisiana and funding for U.S. military operations overseas at an annual rate of $74 billion.  There have been broad requests for a clean continuing resolution. So thats what Ive just offered, said McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, who described the measure as a product of bipartisan negotiations. Democrats quickly opposed the resolution as a Republican-only bill that would not help Flint, Michigan, cope with lead-contaminated water and would leave in place a prohibition against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requiring public companies to disclose political spending. We Democrats cannot vote for that, said Senator Barbara Mikulski, top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters that plans were already in place for an orderly government shutdown in the event that Congress cannot agree on a funding measure. McConnell left out a provision backed by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his former White House rival, Senator Ted Cruz, that would have stopped the U.S. government from moving oversight of the internets technical management to a global community of stakeholders on Oct. 1. Also absent was language that would have enabled the U.S. Export-Import Bank to approve loans or guarantees of more than $10 million. Republicans and Democrats had sought to include a provision, but the issue proved too controversial for the must-pass funding resolution. A senior Republican aide said the Senate would begin voting on the funding legislation as early as Monday. ",politicsNews,"September 22, 2016 ",1
U.S. lawmakers accuse Russia of seeking to influence U.S. election,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Democrats on the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives intelligence committees accused Russia on Thursday of trying to influence the Nov. 8 U.S. election via computer hacking, and called on President Vladimir Putin to order a halt. Based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election, Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Adam Schiff said in an unusually strongly worded joint statement. Officials in the administration of President Barack Obama have said they concluded that Russia or its proxies were responsible for hacking political party organizations. The government has not publicly blamed Russia. Russia has denied it sponsors or encourages any hacking activity. The lawmakers said the Russian effort was intended to sow doubt about the security of the U.S. election, and that the orders for intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the Moscow government. We call on President Putin to immediately order a halt to this activity. Americans will not stand for any foreign government trying to influence our election. We hope all Americans will stand together and reject the Russian effort, the statement said. U.S. relations with Russia have had a high profile in campaigning for the Nov. 8 election, in which the White House, one third of the Senate seats and all the House seats are up for grabs. Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has been criticized by Democrats - and some Republicans - for his praise of Putin. ",politicsNews,"September 22, 2016 ",1
U.S. appeals court hears arguments on Virginia's voter ID law,"RICHMOND, VA. (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday heard Virginia Democrats challenge to a Republican-backed state law requiring prospective voters to show approved photo identification before casting ballots. The three-judge panel from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals repeatedly questioned attorneys about similarities between Virginias 2013 statute and North Carolinas photo ID law. The appeals court struck down the North Carolina law in July, ruling that it intentionally discriminated against minority voters. The Virginia Democratic Party wants the law overturned, contending the measure was intended to counter its growing political clout in the state. Republicans say it was aimed at combating voter fraud. Judge Dennis Shedd asked attorney Bruce Spiva, who  represented opponents of the law: Was it as egregious as North Carolinas [law] was as seen by the court? Yes, your honor, said Spiva. Was the motive in Virginia as bad if not worse? Shedd asked, referring to the intent of racism found by the court in North Carolinas law. As bad, your honor, Spiva said. He added that the law was especially burdensome for minorities and young people, who tend to vote Democratic. Mark Hearne, who defended the state measure, said the Virginia photo ID law was different from North Carolinas. Among other factors, Hearne said, there had been no evidence of discriminatory intent as the court found in the North Carolina case. The appeal ahead of the Nov. 8 elections is among several legal challenges around the United States to voter identification laws that were driven by Republicans, who argue that they prevent election fraud. The appeals panel did not say when it might rule. U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson in May had upheld the law passed by the Republican-led legislature and signed by then-Governor Robert McDonnell, also a Republican. He said the inconvenience to potential voters was not enough to merit striking it down. Democrats have made gains in the state, once a Republican stronghold. President Barack Obama won the state in 2008, boosted by turnout among black, Latino and young voters, and again in 2012. Virginias governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and both U.S. senators are Democrats. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton also leads Republican opponent Donald Trump in Virginia opinion polls.

NYC mayor warns Trump: 'stop and frisk' will make things worse,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio warned Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday against embracing the stop and frisk police tactic that he said would worsen relations between police and community in the country. Trump has praised the anti-crime tactic in which police stop, question and search pedestrians for weapons or contraband and said on Fox News on Thursday it massively changed the crime statistics in New York City. Stop and frisk worked, Trump said on Fox & Friends on Thursday. He said the crime-ridden city of Chicago needed to adopt the tactic.  De Blasio rejected that claim and attributed the sharp drop in crime to another strategy adopted by Bill Bratton, the citys longtime police commissioner who retired less than a week ago. Bratton championed the broken windows policing strategy that emphasizes pursuit of crimes no matter how minor. In his resignation letter he attributed the decline in crime in New York City, the nations largest with 8.5 million people, to additional officers and an emphasis on building bonds within neighborhoods.  Donald Trump talks about stop and frisk like he knows the facts, de Blasio said in an interview with CNN. He has had no experience with policing, no experience with public safety.  He should really be careful because if we reinstitute stop and frisk all over this country, you would see a lot more tension between police and community. Police tactics and deadly encounters with African-Americans, many of them unarmed, have sparked protests and unrest across the country. A state of emergency was declared in Charlotte, North Carolina, after a second night of unrest sparked by the fatal police shooting of a black man. There have also been protests in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in recent days demanding the arrest of a police officer seen in a video last week fatally shooting an unarmed black man who had his hands in clear view at the time.  The stop and frisk policy gained traction in New York City under Mayor Rudy Giuliani, now a top Trump supporter. De Blasio promised to end the practice during his 2013 mayoral campaign. De Blasio also credited the continued drop in crime in New York City in recent decades to a crime reduction strategy adopted by Bratton called CompStat, which adopts statistical strategies to achieve more effective policing. Thats what changed things in New York City, de Blasio said, adding crime has gone down in the three years since his administration curtailed the use of stop and frisk.

Obama to veto September 11 lawsuit bill by Friday: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama intends to veto by Friday evening legislation allowing survivors and families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia, the White House said. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters the president will veto Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act within the constitutionally mandated 10-day window, which ends Friday evening. The Obama administration opposed the bill on grounds that other countries could use the law as an excuse to sue U.S. diplomats, service members or companies.  ",politicsNews,"September 22, 2016 ",1
U.S. presidential debates: from Kennedy-Nixon to Clinton-Trump,"(Reuters) - Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump face off on Monday in the first of a series of televised debates that could prove crucial to who wins the White House on Nov. 8. The first debate will take place at Hofstra University on New York states Long Island. The Commission on Presidential Debates has scheduled two more such presidential matchups and a vice presidential debate in October. The rhetorical contests, which first appeared on television in 1960, have provided some of the most memorable moments and quotations in modern American political history. Here is a look at the highlights over more than five decades. 1960: Seventy million viewers watched the first televised American presidential debate, which pitted Republican Vice President Richard Nixon against Democratic nominee John F. Kennedy. Nixon was recovering from a hospital visit and had a 5-oclock shadow, having refused makeup. In contrast, Kennedys delivery was smooth and charismatic. Viewers focused on what they saw, not what they heard. Kennedy won the election. 1976: In the first TV debate in 16 years, Democrat Jimmy Carter faced off against unelected incumbent President Gerald Ford. This was also the first time vice presidential candidates debated on television, with Republican U.S. Senator Bob Dole squaring off against Democratic U.S. Senator Walter Mondale. Carter benefited when Ford said: There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration. News media played up Fords remark as a major blunder, and many analysts thought it helped Carter win the  election. 1980: Carter appeared only in a second debate with Republican Ronald Reagan after boycotting the first one because it included a third-party candidate, John Anderson. The president accused Reagan of planning to cut Medicare healthcare funding for the elderly. Reagan, who had complained Carter was misrepresenting his stands on any number of issues, said: There you go again, and chuckled, prompting audience laughter and coining a catchphrase. Reagan won the election. The encounter attracted 80.6 million viewers, the highest number ever for a presidential debate, according to ratings company Nielsen. 1984: Reagan, 73, successfully defused the issue of his age during the second debate with Democratic candidate Walter Mondale, 56, when he quipped: I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponents youth and inexperience. Reagan was re-elected. 1988: The second presidential debate involving Republican Vice President George H.W. Bush and Democratic challenger Michael Dukakis opened with a question to the Massachusetts governor on whether he would favor the death penalty for someone who raped and murdered his wife. The question was posed to bring out the human side of a candidate dubbed the Ice Man. His laborious response on an emotional issue did just the opposite. Bush won the election. The vice presidential debate came alive when U.S. Senator Dan Quayle, Bushs running mate, compared himself politically to John F. Kennedy. Democratic U.S. Senator Lloyd Bentsen replied in quiet, deadly tones: Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, youre no Jack Kennedy.  1992: This years three debates became the first time three candidates - Bush, Democrat Bill Clinton, and independent Ross Perot - shared the platform. Clinton won the election. 1996: In the second debate between Republican Bob Dole and Clinton, Dole was asked by a student whether at 73 he was too old to understand the needs of young people. He replied that at his age, intelligence and experience meant he had the advantage of wisdom. Clinton retorted: I can only tell you that I dont think Senator Dole is too old to be president. Its the age of his ideas that I question. Clinton was re-elected. 2000: Vice President Al Gore and Republican contender George W. Bush took part in three debates. We all make mistakes. Ive been known to mangle a syllable or two myself, Bush said during the second of the debates, purposely mispronouncing the word syllable. During the first encounter, Gore drew negative reviews for sighing loudly while Bush spoke. The Texas governor and son of George H.W. Bush won the election. 2004: The last debate between Bush and Democratic U.S. Senator John Kerry offered voters a stark contrast in styles, with Bush sticking to simple arguments while Kerry released an array of facts to make his case. Bush was re-elected. 2008: The three Obama-John McCain encounters averaged 57.4 million viewers, more than the average for the three debates in 2004, according to Nielsen. Republican U.S. Senator McCain, his back against the wall, turned in his best performance in the last debate, but Democratic U.S. Senator Barack Obama won the White House. The vice presidential debate riveted about 69.9 million Americans, and thus tied as the second most-viewed debate ever.     Republican Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and Democratic U.S. Senator Joe Biden clashed on the economy and Iraq during a lively but polite debate. She frequently displayed a folksy style. At one point, she said: Aw, say it aint so, Joe, adding a doggone it for good measure. Biden and Palin both said they would work to change current U.S. economic policy to make it more friendly to middle-class workers, but Biden said that McCain had called the fundamentals of the economy strong as the financial crisis broke out. 2012: Obama stumbled in his first debate with Republican challenger Mitt Romney, surprising and worrying his supporters. But in the second debate, Romney, responding to a question about gender pay equality, said he had binders full of women as candidates for Cabinet posts. The phrase became a meme on social media, with tweets, original artwork and a Facebook group spoofing the former Massachusetts governor. ",politicsNews,"September 22, 2016 ",1
Judge dismisses case against North Carolina's gay marriage opt-out law,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge threw out a challenge to a North Carolina law that allows government officials to refuse to perform same-sex marriages if they cite religious objections, claiming the couples who brought the suit failed to establish they were harmed by the law. The six plaintiffs, who include gay couples, argued in the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Asheville that the legislation - Senate Bill 2 - allows magistrates and other officials performing marriages to put their personal beliefs before their sworn constitutional duty.  The plaintiffs said on Wednesday they would appeal the ruling issued by U.S. District Judge Max Cogburn on Tuesday. Cogburn said the plaintiffs had not argued they were being directly injured by the law, but instead said that their tax dollars were not being used according to the constitution.  He said they had not presented enough evidence to prove they had been harmed as taxpayers, although he did add that citizens could potentially suffer real or emotional harm as a result of the law because the magistrates decision to opt-out is secret.  North Carolinas Republican-led legislature passed the law in 2015 as social conservatives nationwide pushed for so-called religious freedom bills in response to same-sex marriage becoming legal. State legislators overrode Republican Governor Pat McCrorys veto of the measure the same month the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage across the country. Data from September 2015 showed at least 32 magistrates across the state have thus far exempted themselves as have Register of Deeds employees in five counties, according the Campaign for Southern Equality, which supported the suit.   Senate Bill 2 expressly declares that magistrates religious beliefs are superior to their oath of judicial office, said attorney Luke Largess from Tin Fulton Walker & Owen, which represented the couples in the case. The law spends public money to advance those religious beliefs. That is a straightforward violation of the First Amendment.  The office of North Carolinas Attorney General declined to comment on the case, according to spokeswoman Noelle Talley. Magistrates who ask to opt out are barred from performing any marriage, gay or heterosexual, for six months.         The nonprofit group the Liberty Counsel, which represented a magistrate as an intervenor in the case, said both the U.S. Constitution and the North Carolina Constitution require accommodation of religious beliefs even for government officials.  North Carolina has come under fire for another law passed earlier this year that prohibits people from using public restrooms not corresponding to their biological sex.  Major sports organizations including the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the National Basketball Association have moved their competitions from the state to protest the so-called bathroom bill.

Putin's close friend: Donald Trump will be next U.S. president,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - One of Vladimir Putins closest friends said on Thursday he believed Donald Trump would be the next president of the United States and that Western leaders were no match for the Russian president. Sergei Roldugin, a childhood friend of Putins and godfather to his eldest daughter, made international headlines earlier this year after his name featured in the leaked Panama Papers as the owner of a sprawling network of offshore accounts. Some Western media said the papers suggested Roldugin, 64, was looking after Putins money. Putin called such reports a provocation and said Roldugin, a famous cellist, had done nothing wrong and spent the money he earned from business on buying expensive musical instruments. Speaking to reporters in the Kremlin on Thursday before Putin bestowed a state award on him, Roldugin said: I know who will win in America. You may check it later. Trump will win. He went on to say that politicians changed their behavior once they were in power. I cant say I feel euphoria about Trump winning because he said he was with Putin and Hillary (Clinton) hasnt said that. Putin has said he will work with either and hes right.  Trump, the Republican candidate, has been criticized by Clinton, his Democratic Party rival, for praising Putin as a strong leader and saying ties with Moscow should be improved at a time when Moscow and Washington are at odds over Syria and Ukraine. The Kremlin has tried to take a neutral stance on the U.S. election, saying it will respect the choice of the American people, though  Kremlin-backed TV channels have tilted their coverage in favor of Trump, whom Putin called very talented. Roldugin told reporters Putin was a more impressive leader than his various Western counterparts. The one thing Ive always admired about him is that he is not afraid to assume responsibility. He often comes under heavy criticism, but he is not afraid (of that) and says: Yes thats what we decided, thats what I decided. He is not afraid of taking responsibility, unlike many Western politicians and American politicians who, as far as I understand, cant bring themselves to say Thats what I decided and thats how it will be. Roldugin listed German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, and U.S. President Barack Obama as being guilty of not taking responsibility and of concealing the true nature of agreements they had struck.

Senate clears way for $1.15 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate cleared the way for a $1.15 billion sale of tanks and other military equipment to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, defending a frequent partner in the Middle East recently subject to harsh criticism in Congress. The Senate voted 71 to 27 to kill legislation that would have stopped the sale. The overwhelming vote stopped an effort led by Republican Senator Rand Paul and Democratic Senator Chris Murphy to block the deal over concerns including Saudi Arabias role in the 18-month-long war in Yemen and worries that it might fuel an ongoing regional arms race. The Pentagon announced on Aug. 9 that the State Department had approved the potential sale of more than 130 Abrams battle tanks, 20 armored recovery vehicles and other equipment to Saudi Arabia. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency said General Dynamics Corp would be the principal contractor for the sale. Paul, Murphy and other opponents of the arms deal were sharply critical of the Riyadh government during debate before the vote, citing Yemen, the kingdoms human rights record and its international support for a conservative form of Islam. If youre serious about stopping the flow of extremist recruiting across this globe, then you have to be serious that the ... brand of Islam that is spread by Saudi Arabia all over the world, is part of the problem, Murphy said. The criticism came days before lawmakers are expected to back another measure seen as anti-Saudi, a bill that would allow lawsuits against the countrys government by relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks. President Barack Obama has promised to veto that bill, but congressional leaders say there is a strong chance that lawmakers will override the veto and let the measure become law. Overriding a presidential veto requires a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate. In Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition is battling Iranian-allied Houthis, the Houthis have accused the United States of arming and supporting the Saudis, who intervened on the side of Yemens exiled government. The war has killed over 10,000 people and displaced more than 3 million. But backers of the deal said Saudi Arabia is an important U.S. ally in a war-torn region, deserving of U.S. support. This motion comes at a singularly unfortunate time and would serve to convince Saudi Arabia and all other observers that the United States does not live up to its commitments, Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said.

Rubio campaign test: Can money bring U.S. Republicans happiness?,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Marco Rubio, the failed U.S. presidential contender, is battling to hold on to his U.S. Senate seat from Florida in what is shaping up to be the costliest congressional contest of 2016. More than $33 million has been raised and over $24 million spent so far by both parties in the Florida race, according to the latest U.S. Federal Election Commission data. That high price tag testifies, in part, to Rubios success in building a national fundraising base as a presidential candidate, even though he was trounced in his own backyard by eventual nominee Donald Trump in the states Republican presidential nominating contest. It also underscores Republicans firm belief that if they cannot hold Rubios seat, they cannot hold the Senate. Rubios re-election bid, launched late in the game in June, is bolstered by the deep pockets of the Senate Leadership Fund. The groups mission is to protect the Republican Senate majority in the Nov. 8 election. It is run by confidants of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. So far, the group has devoted more money to Florida than any other state, spending $3.4 million to attack Rubios Democratic opponent, U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group. The Republican fund is sitting on a mountain of cash - at least $40 million on hand for the closing weeks of Senate campaigns nationwide. That looks to be having an impact.  Rubio led Murphy by an average of 5.7 percentage points on Wednesday in RealClear Politics basket of polls for Aug. 31 to Sept. 19. With that in view, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has decided to scale back its plans for television and internet advertisements for Murphy in Florida to $6 million from $10 million between now and Nov. 8, a DSCC official said. Even the remaining money is being held back until the final three weeks of the campaign, the official added. Instead, Democrats are redeploying into lower-cost media markets in North Carolina, Missouri and Indiana, according to the DSCC, which works to elect more Democrats to the Senate. Until June 22, when Rubio decided he wanted to return to the Senate despite a low attendance record in his first term, Democrats saw Florida as low-hanging fruit. That was because Republicans had fielded a roster of candidates with limited statewide appeal and money-raising ability. Rubio, hoping to remain a rising Republican star with an eye on a 2020 run for president, quickly cleared the field, knocking out his last Republican opponent, a wealthy political novice, and setting up his race against Murphy. As of Aug. 10, Rubio had raised $14.2 million and spent $6.3 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, citing Federal Election Commission figures. Murphy had raised $11.2 million and spent $7.8 million. Despite the money disadvantage, Murphy is by no means vanquished. A Sept. 16-19 poll by Monmouth University had Rubio leading by only 2 percentage points, and showed Murphy enjoying a 14-point lead in Rubios home base of South Florida. If the numbers improve further for Murphy, the DSCC could readjust and, like a race-track bettor, scurry to plunk down millions of new dollars in a renewed Florida push. Last week, a Democratic political action committee and the AFSCME labor union announced a $1.8 million anti-Rubio ad campaign as part of a $10 million ad plan. While money plays an outsized role, it is not everything in this freewheeling U.S. election season. For instance, the political fortunes of Republican presidential nominee Trump could benefit other Republicans, including Rubio. Trump has opened a 4-point lead against Democratic presidential nominee  Hillary Clinton in Florida, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos polling. In a Senate hallway interview, Rubio downplayed any Trump effect, even a positive one, saying: I always feel like I need to win my own race. Rubio has endorsed Trump, but clashed sharply with him when they were presidential rivals. U.S. Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, who heads the National Republican Senatorial Committee emphasized the importance of Florida to Republicans hopes of keeping control of the Senate. Asked about Democrats refocusing resources from Florida to other states, Wicker said: If they take their money out and put it someplace else, well combat it there, adding: We are going to stay vigilant in the state of Florida.

"Biden warns Ukraine on reforms, says EU sanctions on Russia at risk","(Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday warned Ukraine needs to live up to its promises economic and political reforms or risk seeing the European Union walk away from its sanctions on Russia. We know that if they give an excuse to the EU, there are at least five countries right now that want to say We want out of sanctions against Moscow, Biden said, speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Europe imposed sanctions after Russia annexed Ukraines Crimea peninsula in 2014. Fighting has continued in the east of the country, despite the so-called Minsk ceasefire agreement, and Western powers fear peace efforts could unravel. In exchange for financial support from the United States and other Western allies, Ukraine promised reforms, but progress has been mixed. Bidens comments came a day after he met with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko at the United Nations, pushing on reforms in Ukraines energy and justice sectors, while saying conditions had been met for a third U.S. sovereign loan guarantee of up to $1 billion. Biden said he has spent two to three hours a week on the phone with Ukrainian leaders since the crisis began, urging them to persist with reforms, while also pressuring Germany, France and Italy to hold fast on sanctions. Theres an overwhelming instinct in Europe to say, Hey: before [Poroshenko] became president, this was owned by Russia anyway. They had a puppet there. What difference does it make? What the hells the difference? Why are you making us engage in these sanctions? Biden said. Noting a crisis of self-doubt in Europe caused by the United Kingdoms referendum decision to leave the bloc and the Syrian migration crisis, Biden said he has warned Poroshenko to make sure that the failure of the Minsk deal is not blamed on Ukraine. Ive been the guy on the back of Ukrainians - which was a thoroughly corrupt system when they came in - making the case that, You have to understand: everybodys willing to blame the victim, and you better straighten up and fly right, Biden said.

Bill Clinton delivers defense of his foundation's 'profound' work,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Bill Clinton on Wednesday called running his familys charitable foundation one of the great honors of his life in a passionate defense against criticism of its work as his wife, Hillary Clinton, campaigns to become president. Speaking onstage in a New York City hotel ballroom for about an hour, he told supporters of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation that it had brought about a profound advance in the conduct and impact of modern philanthropy.  Dont give up what brought you here, he said, closing out the 12th and final annual conference organized by the foundation, called the Clinton Global Initiative. You have done something good and noble and worthy. The foundation, which Clinton founded as he prepared to leave the White House in 2001, has come under intense scrutiny brought about by a long presidential campaign.  Journalists have scoured newly released email records from Hillary Clintons tenure running the State Department from 2009 to 2013, which show foundation officials seeking meetings with Clinton or other diplomats on behalf of donors.  Donald Trump, Clintons Republican opponent for the presidency, has called for a special prosecutor to investigate allegations of breaching government ethics rules. The Clintons have said that even if some of their wealthiest donors, which include corporations and foreign governments with interests before the U.S. government, may have hoped for special favors in return, none were granted. To avert suggestions of conflicts of interest, the foundation has said it will drastically limit its operations if Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Partys presidential candidate, wins the election to succeed Barack Obama on Nov. 8.  It would stop accepting money from foreign and corporate donors, foundation officials say, and much of its work would be spun off into independent entities not controlled by the Clintons. Bill Clinton, 70, has expressed frustration that political journalists covering his wifes campaign have written more about the foundations donors, which include the government of Saudi Arabia and foreign billionaires, than the charitable programs it runs.  He spoke at length about how he had been moved by meeting children with HIV in Cambodia, orphans left behind by the 2004 tsunami that struck Indonesia and victims of the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. He made only oblique references to the 2016 election campaign. Everywhere today there is a temptation to say that everything I just told you is wrong, Life is a zero-sum game and Im losing; no, youre wrong, our differences matter more than our common humanity, he said. These are not the right choices. (Refiles to make clear in paragraph 5 that foundation officials were seeking the meetings on behalf of donors.) ",politicsNews,"September 22, 2016 ",1
U.S. cities push for local laws to oversee police surveillance,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - A number of U.S. cities are introducing proposals to mandate community oversight of police use of digital surveillance technology as evidence mounts that black or poor neighborhoods are being more heavily scrutinized than others, civil rights activists said on Wednesday. The legislative measures are being introduced by lawmakers in 11 cities from Seattle to Washington, D.C., and are backed by a coalition of 17 groups led by the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. (We need) to build the legislative power of local communities to prevent high-tech racial profiling and policing from turning our neighborhoods into open-air prisons, Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice, told reporters on a conference call during which the proposals were announced on Wednesday. The coalition said the proposals stemmed from the growing use by departments across the country of high-tech equipment or software, some of which was developed for battlefields, to surreptitiously monitor poor or predominately black neighborhoods, Muslims, or the street-level movements of activists within the Black Lives Matter movement. The proposed bills would mandate city council approval of the use and purchase of surveillance equipment, and input and oversight from communities on how it is used. We want to give municipalities the ability to say no, Cyril said.  Proposals were introduced on Wednesday in Miami Beach and Pensacola, Florida, and others were expected in the coming weeks in New York City, Milwaukee, Muskegon, Michigan, and other localities, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said. Palo Alto, California, will vote on its proposal later in September, and Hattiesburg, Mississippi, is introducing legislation in October, the ACLU said. Police departments across the United States are facing intense scrutiny over the use of excessive force especially against black people, accountability and accusations of racial bias. Police officials have said digital surveillance tools are needed for crime prevention and pointed to reduced crime in some areas where they are used. The coalition said blacks have been disproportionately targeted by automatic license plate readers in Oakland, California, closed-circuit television surveillance in Lansing, Michigan, a stingray that mimics cell phone towers to track a phone users location in Baltimore, Maryland, and social media monitoring software.",politicsNews,"September 21, 2016 ",1
Trump opposes plan for U.S. to cede internet oversight,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump opposes a long-planned transition of oversight of the internets technical management from the U.S. government to a global community of stakeholders, his campaign said in a statement on Wednesday. Congress should block the handover, scheduled to occur on Oct. 1, or internet freedom will be lost for good, since there will be no way to make it great again once it is lost, Stephen Miller, national policy director for the Trump campaign, said in a statement. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a former presidential primary foe of Trumps who has refused to endorse the real estate developer, has led a movement in Congress to block the transition, arguing it could cede control of the internet itself to authoritarian regimes like Russia and China and threaten online freedom. Technical experts have said those claims are baseless, and that a delay will backfire by undermining U.S. credibility in future international negotiations over internet standards and security. Publicly proposed in March 2014, the transfer of oversight of the nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, is expected to go forward unless Congress votes to block the move.  A vote to delay the transition may come as an amendment to a temporary spending bill that Congress must pass by Sept. 30 to prevent much of the federal government from shutting down. Congressional negotiators on Wednesday were working to finalize an agreement on the spending package. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton supports the Obama administrations planned transition to a global community of technologists, civil society groups and internet users, according to policy positions available on her campaign website.

Kansas argues against boost in school funding,"(Reuters) - Kansas sought on Wednesday to avoid a court ruling that could force the cash-strapped state to increase school funding by more than $1 billion. Lawyers for the state and for public school districts faced off before the Kansas Supreme Court in the latest chapter of a decades-long battle over equitable and adequate funding. Stephen McAllister, the states solicitor general, argued that while Kansas may be spending less on education than some other states, student achievement is improving. Kansas is making excellent use of resources to do pretty well compared to the nation, he told the justices. The state spends about $4 billion on schools, but lawyers for the four districts suing the state claim another $430 million to $1.4 billion would be required to meet the state constitutions requirement for adequate funding.  Were falling short and were leaving massive numbers of kids behind, said Alan Rupe, an attorney for the districts. He asked the court to declare the system unconstitutional and give the state legislature some direction on achieving constitutionality and a full legislative session to come up with a new system. The justices did not indicate when they might rule. The adequacy question comes after the court ruled in June that Kansas had complied with its order to resolve inequities in educating students. Kansas budget is feeling the effects of actions taken by Republican Governor Sam Brownback and the legislature in recent years to cut corporate and other income taxes in hopes of helping the state compete with bordering Missouri and other states for business development and jobs. The states fiscal woes led Standard & Poors to downgrade Kansas credit rating by one notch to AA-minus in July. ",politicsNews,"September 21, 2016 ",1
Ryan has concerns over 9/11 Saudi bill but predicts veto override,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives would override any presidential veto of a bill allowing survivors and families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia, Speaker Paul Ryan predicted on Wednesday while also citing concerns with the legislation. I worry about legal matters. I worry about trial lawyers trying to get rich off of this. And I do worry about the precedence. At the same time, these victims do need to have their day in court, Ryan, a Republican, told reporters. Congress has overwhelmingly passed the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act in reaction to long-running suspicions, denied by Saudi Arabia, that hijackers of the four U.S. jetliners that attacked the United States in 2001  were backed by the Saudi government.  Obama in coming days is expected to veto the bill on grounds that other countries could use the law as an excuse to sue U.S. diplomats, service members or companies. But Congress could have the last word if the Senate and House of Representatives each override that veto by a two-thirds vote. I do think the votes are there for the override, Ryan said. When asked by a reporter if U.S. support for Saudi Arabia was unconditional, Ryan responded that the country is a very important and valuable ally and is helping Washington in the war on terror. He noted, however, Our support for any country is not unconditional. ",politicsNews,"September 21, 2016 ",1
European Union asks Obama to stop 9/11 Saudi bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The European Union on Wednesday called on President Barack Obama to block a U.S. bill allowing survivors and families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia, saying it was in violation of international law. The possible adoption and implementation of the (bill) would be in conflict with fundamental principles of international law and in particular the principle of State sovereign immunity, the European Union delegation to the United States said in a letter to the U.S. Department of State seen by Reuters.

"Trump scores with small money, lags with big donors","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been a hit with small donors, raking in two-thirds of his individual campaign contributions in sums of $200 or less, according to financial disclosures filed on Tuesday.  But with the big-money donor class, the players Trump blasted during the primary season as greedy influence peddlers, the celebrity businessman has fallen short of expectations, the disclosures filed with the federal government showed. Trump took in 65 percent of his total $75 million in individual campaign contributions from people who pitched in $200 or less, but Super PAC contributions fell short of expectations.  Great America PAC, the pro-Trump Super PAC led by Republican operative Ed Rollins, said in July it expected to pull in more than $20 million by now. Instead, it has raised just $11 million, according to the latest campaign finance disclosures.  In a similar fashion, a pro-Trump Super PAC kicked off by Los Angeles real estate investor Tom Barrack, Rebuilding America Now, said in June it had $32 million in fundraising commitments. But it received just over $2 million that month. A spokesperson for the Super PAC says it has now raised $18 million. It will not file its next report until October 15.   The Republican kingmaker who was expected to be Trumps single biggest backer, casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, has scaled back his initial pledge of $100 million, made in a private meeting with Trump in May, to just $5 million, according to two associates close to Adelson familiar with the matter. Democrat Hillary Clinton, who will face Trump in the Nov. 8 election, has received about a quarter of her campaign donations from people who contributed $200 or less - $71 million out of a total of $289 million, according to disclosures.  Among the biggest backers to the pro-Clinton Super PAC, Priorities USA, were Donald Sussman, president of Paloma Partners Advisors, Inc, George Soros, chairman of Soros Fund Management, and Daniel Abraham, executive at SDA Enterprises. Clintons money advantage will help her fund ad campaigns and get-out-the-vote efforts in the final stretch the 2016 election. She leads Trump by 4 percentage points nationally, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll. Together, Clintons campaign and Super PAC have raked in a total of $520 million. By comparison, Trumps campaign and two Super PACs backing him have brought in a combined $200 million. Super PACs can raise unlimited money for candidates as long as they dont directly coordinate with the campaign. The latest filings, which cover spending through August 31, showed a big increase in Trumps spending, with $30 million in disbursements, more than any month so far. They also provided further insight into the stark differences between the two candidates operations. The Clinton campaigns outlays reflect a traditional presidential playbook, spending five times more than Trumps has on television ads and nine times more on payrolls. The Trump campaign has spent $21 million on online advertising and strategy, $11 million on T-shirts, trucker hats and yard signs, and $4 million on field consulting.  Trump recently scored a promise of a $1 million donation from the Ricketts family, which had previously backed a Super PAC opposing him, but he has yet to see the flurry of large checks that flowed into the coffers of former Republican White House rivals such as Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz.  Instead of plowing money into the Trump campaign, Adelson -  like his fellow top conservative backers, the billionaire industrialist Koch Brothers - will focus his efforts and donations on Senate and House of Representatives races, two sources said. Tuesday nights filings show Adelson and his physician wife Miriam gave $20 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican Super PAC.  The Adelsons plan on giving an additional $20 million to the Super PAC that backs Republican House candidates, the sources said. (Corrects date) ",politicsNews,"September 21, 2016 ",1
House committee launches review of FDA criminal office,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional committee has launched an examination of the Food and Drug Administrations criminal office, raising questions about the units management and handling of cases involving food, drugs and devices. The House Energy and Commerce Committee told FDA Commissioner Robert Califf it is examining management concerns and possible morale concerns with the field offices of the Office of Criminal Investigations. The September 20 letter, signed by committee chairman Fred Upton and Tim Murphy, chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, seeks answers to a detailed list of questions by October 12. Among other issues, the House committee questions why George Karavetsos, director of the Rockville, Maryland-based FDA criminal office, is allowed to run the unit from an office in South Florida, near his home. An FDA spokeswoman said the agency received the letter and will respond to the committee directly. The House questions come two weeks after Reuters reported how some FDA agents complain criminal office managers have forced them to pursue cases involving mislabeled foreign-imported injectable drugs, at the expense of cases with more potential to protect the public health. Current and former agents complain they have turned into the Botox Police, spending thousands of hours chasing doctors who purchased authentic versions of Allergans anti-wrinkle drug that were labeled for use in other countries. Some agents say their efforts have done little more than protect the pharmaceutical industrys high drug prices in the United States. Those concerns come as the criminal office has had mixed success in bringing cases. From fiscal year 2008-2015, Reuters found, more than half of all opened OCI cases were closed without action. The House committee asked Califf to explain the process for how criminal cases get opened, and to provide statistics on OCIs arrests, convictions, case initiations and amount of money recovered. Reuters also reported on Karavetsos relocation to Florida, a move that came less than two years after the FDA paid more than $25,000 to move him to Maryland. Karavetsos, in a prior interview, defended the offices efforts, saying statistics are not a fair measure of OCIs success because public health and safety will always trump the criminal investigation.  FDA Regulatory Affairs Associate Commissioner Melinda Plaisier defended Karavetsos move to Miami, saying it was good for the FDA and his family. The House committee letter also questions how the FDA responded to two prior reports, from the Government Accountability Office and the Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, that were critical of the criminal office. The 2012 OIG report cited problems with how the Rockville-based office is run and concluded that field offices lack the discretion to open cases to address food and drug concerns prevalent in their locales. The report cited a lack of independence within the FDAs criminal office. OCI is housed within the Office of Regulatory Affairs, which is responsible for compliance inspections and helps determine the criminal offices budget. The inspector general recommended structural changes to ensure the independence of investigations. FDA leadership at that time rejected those suggestions. The criminal office headquarters controls the opening of investigations. Some agents have questioned the offices priorities and say they have, on occasion, been told not to open cases involving other federal agencies. A September 2015 email from Robert West, the recently retired Special Agent in Charge of the Miami field office, is one example. West, in the email, contended agencies including the FBI, the HHS OIG and Homeland Security investigators were riding our coattails and were not bringing anything to the table. Involving those agencies in an investigation from day one, he wrote, is unacceptable. West previously declined interview requests. Reuters could not immediately reach him Tuesday through an FDA spokeswoman. ",politicsNews,"September 21, 2016 ",1
"Clinton calls national security team after attacks, as Trump challenges her credentials","WASHINGTON/HIGH POINT, N.C. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton consulted national security advisers on Tuesday after weekend bomb blasts renewed fears of domestic attacks, as Republican Donald Trump accused her of pushing policies that made the United States less safe. The two rivals in the Nov. 8 election have been vying to portray themselves as the best equipped to protect the nation.  The domestic security issue returned to the forefront after a New York City bomb injured 29 people, a pipe bomb went off and unexploded bombs turned up in separate incidents in New Jersey, and a man stabbed 10 people at a Minnesota mall.  Clinton spoke by phone with former Defense Department official Michele Flournoy, former CIA deputy head Mike Morell and other advisers, her campaign said in an email.  We cant lose our cool and start ranting and waving our arms, Clinton said on the call, according to her campaign in an apparent reference to Trump. We shouldnt toss around extreme proposals that wont be effective and lose sight of who we are. Thats what the terrorists are aiming for. The call was supposed to be open to news media, but when reporters called in, they could not hear anything. Clintons campaign provided notes to reporters afterward. Clinton has called for better intelligence, new efforts to counter online recruiting of militants and smashing Islamic State strongholds in the Middle East. She has said Trumps rhetoric against what he calls radical Islamic terrorism is helping Islamic State recruit more fighters. At a rally in High Point, North Carolina, Trump countered by saying that Clinton, as Democratic President Barack Obamas first secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, backed policies that made the United States less safe. Im much tougher than her on this horrible situation, but she goes around saying its a recruiting tool, Trump said. The New York businessman accused Clinton of supporting policies in Iraq and Syria that he said allowed Islamic State to take root.  Trump has pointed to the pullout of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011 - which occurred after the Obama administration and Iraqi leaders could not agree on the withdrawal - and what he has characterized as a push for regime change in Syria. A U.S.-led coalition has conducted air strikes on Islamic State in Iraq and northern Syria. Trump also criticized Clinton for supporting the entry of some Syrian refugees into the United States, reiterating his call for tougher vetting of people seeking admission. He has instead proposed safe zones for refugees, which he says Gulf states would fund. Theres nothing like doing things with other peoples money, Trump said at a rally later on Tuesday in Kenansville, North Carolina. On Monday, U.S. authorities arrested Ahmad Khan Rahami following a shootout with police in Linden, New Jersey, in connection with the Saturday night bombing in Manhattans Chelsea neighborhood. Rahami, 28, is a naturalized American citizen born in Afghanistan. Law enforcement officials were also investigating the stabbings, also on Saturday night, at the St. Cloud, Minnesota, mall as an act of terrorism. An off-duty policeman fatally shot the attacker, Dahir Adan, 20, whom an Islamic State news agency claimed as a soldier of the militant group. Reuters could not verify the claim. Adan came from a Somali family that settled in the United States. At the Kenansville rally, Trump said he would dislodge a political establishment that he said ignored working people. They go to the same restaurants, they go to the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections, they write checks to the same think tanks and produce the same papers, its a gravy train that never ends, Trump said. Democrats, in turn, criticized Trumps business activities. U.S. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid called the real estate developer a fraud in a speech on the Senate floor, pointing to his multiple bankruptcies and lawsuits. Clintons campaign repeated its call for Trump to release his tax returns after The Washington Post reported Trumps charitable foundation had spent thousands of dollars to settle lawsuits involving his businesses.

China's premier says U.S. ties will develop no matter who wins election,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - China and the United States will keep developing positive relations no matter who wins Novembers U.S. presidential election, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told an economic forum in New York on Tuesday. Li declined to comment on which candidate he favored. Republican Donald Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on Chinese goods and push for tougher trade talks if elected. His Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has changed tack on trade, backing away from a Pacific trade pact she previously endorsed. Both candidates have been critical of Chinas assertive pursuit of territory in the South China Sea, a potential flashpoint in Asia and a cause of significant friction in relations between Washington and Beijing. Li, who was attending the U.N. General Assembly in New York, said the U.S. election was an internal affair for the United States, so what he could say was very limited, but he went on to remark: No matter who gets elected in the U.S. presidential election, I believe that China-U.S. ties will continue to grow steadily and in a positive direction. Li responded to complaints from foreign business leaders about restricted access to the Chinese market by saying that China was open to foreign investment, although some economic sectors were not yet mature. This process of them becoming more mature is also a process for them to open up and the areas of the Chinese economy open to foreign investment will only increase and China will only open its door even wider. The door will not close, he said. Referring to a U.S.-China Bilateral Investment Treaty that has been long in negotiation given disagreements about access to sectors the sides deem sensitive, Li said as long as both countries took a strong and pragmatic approach, they would be able to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. As an example of Chinas willingness to open up its markets,  Li said China had decided to designate a Chinese investment bank as a clearing bank for renminbi business in New York and welcomed foreign banks in the city which met eligibility requirements to become clearing banks for the currency. He also said China would soon allow imports of beef on the bone from the United States, now that Chinese quarantine procedures had been completed. Li pledged that China would not engineer a devaluation of its currency to boost exports for its economy, which is growing at its slowest rate in two decades. Some critics in Washington have charged that Beijing is still manipulating its currency, although the U.S. Treasury says its assessment is that it is not undervalued. Chinas economy will continue its growth momentum this year, Li said. I can say here that in the third quarter of this year, or until the end of this year, Chinas economy will maintain this momentum of steady growth.  Chinas growth target for this year is 6.5 to 7 percent. In the second quarter of this year, the worlds second-largest economy grew 6.7 percent from a year ago, according to official data.

Obama urges Israel end occupation and Palestinians accept Israel,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Both sides would benefit if Israel recognized it cannot permanently occupy Palestinian land and if Palestinians rejected incitement and recognized Israels legitimacy, U.S. President Barack Obama told the United Nations on Tuesday. Obamas efforts to bring about an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement have failed over the nearly eight years he has been in the White House, with the latest push by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry collapsing in 2014. U.S. officials have held out the possibility Obama could lay out the rough outlines of a deal - parameters in diplomatic parlance - after the Nov. 8 presidential election and before he leaves office in January, but many analysts doubt this would have much effect. Surely Israelis and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel ...(and if) Israel recognizes that it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land, Obama said. Speaking at the General Assembly annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations for the last time as president, Obama also said Russia was trying to recover lost glory through force.  He warned Russia that if it continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it may be popular at home, it may fuel nationalist fervor for a time, but over time it is also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure. Russia annexed Ukraines Crimean peninsula in 2014 after months of protests in Kiev ousted pro-Moscow Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich. On the international dispute over the South China Sea, Obama said: A peaceful resolution of disputes offered by law will mean far greater stability then the militarization of a few rocks and reefs.  China claims almost all of the South China Sea, through which ships carrying about $5 trillion in trade pass every year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims in the sea, which is also believed to be rich in energy resources and fish stocks. In July, an arbitration court in The Hague said Chinas claims to the waterway were invalid, in a case was brought by the Philippines. Beijing has refused to recognize the ruling.

Senators push Wells Fargo CEO on pay clawbacks after bogus accounts,"(Reuters) - U.S. Senate lawmakers excoriated Wells Fargo & Cos chief on Tuesday for his oversight of the bank as it opened 2 million bogus customer accounts, potentially laying the groundwork for new rules and reviving questions of whether banks are too big to fail.  Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that customers who had bogus accounts opened in their name will be made whole and compensated for any damage to their credit rating, but some Democratic senators called for his resignation. Under fire, Stumpf said he has told his managers to do whatever it takes to make customers whole, refunding fees or compensating them for damage to their credit ratings. But he stood behind the former executive who ran the unit that oversaw many of the practices, and at times downplayed the scope of the affair. In answer to a question, he declined to commit to setting aside mandatory arbitration agreements that prohibit clients from suing Wells Fargo. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau has proposed a ban on such clauses that prohibit class-action lawsuits. Earlier this month, the lender agreed to pay $190 million in penalties and customer payouts to settle the case involving the creation of credit, savings and other accounts without customers knowledge. About $5 million will directly go to customers, many of whom might have paid a small fee on the unwanted accounts. The revelations are a severe hit to Wells Fargos reputation. During the financial crisis, the bank trumpeted itself as conservative, in contrast to its rivals.  Besides potential criminal charges against the company and its executives, Wells Fargo may face pressure from shareholders to change its practices on executive pay and governance.  The scandal also renewed debate over whether U.S. banks are too big to fail and need closer government oversight to prevent a massive collapse.  Lawmakers could use the fraud settlement as a springboard for new rules on executive pay, including clawbacks of compensation, and limits on forced arbitration. Wells Fargo has said its board will assess whether to cancel or claw back any incentive compensation paid to a now-retired executive at the center of the scandal, Carrie Tolstedt.  Democratic Senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called for Stumpf to resign, with Warren saying Stumpf should give back his salary and be criminally investigated.  You should resign. You should give back the money you took while this scam was going on, and you should be criminally investigated, Warren said.  The banks board of directors is examining what action it should take against company executives, Stumpf told the committee.         I accept full responsibility for all unethical sales practices, Stumpf said, adding later, I apologize to all of the American people and our customers, and I will make it right.  Lawmakers said the phony bank accounts might have hurt customer credit ratings, increased the cost of a mortgage or car loan. New credit card applications and consumer borrowing trends can weight on an individuals credit. Wells Fargo has acknowledged bank employees inappropriately opened the customer accounts and that about 5,300 employees were fired over five years. Former bank employees say they were under intense pressure to add accounts for each customer.     Abuses were found as early as 2011, Stumpf said, but bank executives only realized the scale of the problem early last year. At that time, Stumpf said, managers came to recognize how a pattern of creating phony accounts could be used to boost unwarranted fees. It never dawned on us that there could be a cycle, the CEO said. It just sort of begs the issue of where was management, said Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the panel. Brown said employees were caught forging signatures, and stealing identities, Social Security numbers, and customers hard-earned cash, so as to hang on to their low-paying jobs and make money for the high-paying executives at Wells Fargo. Thomas Curry, the Comptroller of the Currency, said the agency is considering action against individual Wells Fargo executives who may have violated laws or regulations.  The U.S. Attorneys Offices in Manhattan and in San Francisco are investigating Wells Fargo, a person familiar with the matter said last week.  While Democratic lawmakers were the most outspoken in their attacks, Republicans also grilled Stumpf. Louisiana Senator David Vitter pressed the CEO on how  customer fraud could persist for years and thousands of employees could be fired before the head of the bank got involved. Why isnt this crystal clear proof that an entity as big as Wells is not only too big to fail but its too big to manage and too big to regulate? Vitter asked. Stumpf said the widespread abuse was a problem of focus and not of size. Stumpf appeared before the congressional panel with a bandaged right hand. He suffered an injury playing with his grandchildren, according to the bank.  Wells Fargo shares rose 2 percent to $46.94. ",politicsNews,"September 20, 2016 ",1
Clinton tells Wells Fargo customers CEO owes them an explanation,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took on the Wells Fargo & Co bogus-accounts case in a letter to the banks customers to be released on Tuesday, when Wells Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf will testify before a Senate committee. Clinton, who faced accusations during her partys primary elections of representing Wall Streets interests, said in the letter that Stumpf owes all of you a clear explanation as to how this happened under his watch.  Earlier this month, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators announced a $185 million settlement with the bank for creating 2 million phantom accounts under actual customers names in a bid to meet internal sales goals. In the letter sent to customers, Clinton laid out a three-prong plan to address what she called the culture of misconduct and recklessness in the banking system. It included clawing back the compensation of individual executives involved in wrongdoing and breaking up big banks that are not managed effectively. She also called for maintaining the CFPB, an agency created in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that Republican lawmakers would like to reorganize. ",politicsNews,"September 20, 2016 ",1
U.S. lawmakers probing Wells Fargo scandal blast arbitration pacts,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co customers aiming to sue the bank over bogus accounts opened in their names may be in for an unpleasant surprise: the fine print requires them to take their claims to an arbitrator instead of a court. Mandatory arbitration rules inserted into account-opening agreements prohibit customers from joining class actions or suing the third-largest U.S. bank in court. Instead, the agreements require individual, closed-door arbitration.  U.S. senators highlighted the issue on Tuesday as they grilled Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf during a hearing. Asked if he would set aside the mandatory arbitration agreements for customers affected by the phantom accounts, Stumpf demurred. Im not an expert in that, he said, adding he would talk to his legal team. That was not enough for some lawmakers. If we had class action on this in 2010, 2009, 2008, the problem never would have gotten so out of hand, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said later, when questioning regulators about the practice. Class actions can be more affordable for unhappy customers, especially those with limited resources, because they can band together to sue, rather than having to hire lawyers individually. Consumers also complain that target companies often choose the arbitrators; proceedings are confidential; and decisions are hard to appeal. Three Wells Fargo customers filed a lawsuit Friday in a Utah federal court, seeking class action status on behalf of hundreds of thousands of customers nationwide they say were harmed by the San Francisco-based banks fraud and recklessness. It was unclear whether they could get around the mandatory arbitration clauses, though. Last year, Wells successfully invoked the clauses to defend against a class action suit tied to bogus accounts. In that case, the judge said customers had to arbitrate because of agreements they signed when opening legitimate accounts at the bank. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a brainchild of Warren, was part of the regulatory group that negotiated a $190 million settlement from Wells Fargo over the bogus accounts. The bureau is considering rules to ban banks, credit card issuers and other companies from forcing customers to submit to arbitration and waive their right to join class action lawsuits. Under the proposal, companies could still use arbitration, but would have to tell consumers they could join class action lawsuits instead. Mandating arbitration when signing up for financial products has become standard practice after a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court decision validated the practice. Still, the tide may be turning, said Joseph Peiffer, a New Orleans lawyer who has represented investors and others in class action lawsuits.  Class actions dissuade companies from ripping people off a thousand dollars here and a thousand dollars there, Peiffer said. ",politicsNews,"September 20, 2016 ",1
White House presses Congress on bill allowing 9/11 families to sue Saudi Arabia,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The White House said on Tuesday it is trying to persuade Congress not to press ahead with a bill that would allow survivors and families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia for damages, in an apparent effort to avoid having a presidential veto overridden. White House spokesman Josh Earnest, speaking during a press briefing in New York, repeated a promise that President Barack Obama would veto the bill, which has been passed by both houses of Congress, but said there was a push to change legislators minds about the law.  White House officials and other senior officials on the presidents national security team have engaged members of Congress and their staffs in both parties in both houses, Earnest said. Congressional aides have said the measure appeared to have enough support, two-thirds majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, for lawmakers to override an Obama veto for the first time since he took office in January 2009. The Senate sent the bill to Obama last week, giving him a 10-day window, which ends on Sept. 23, to veto the measure. Were going to continue that engagement up to and through the president vetoing this legislation in the hopes that we can find an alternative that preserves the effective response that weve already designed to counter state sponsors of terrorism rather than leaving that designation subject to individual decisions by individual judges, Earnest said.      The bill could lead to U.S. diplomats, service members and companies being taken to court all over the world because it would erode the principle of sovereign immunity, he said.

Bid to block U.S. arms sale to Saudis faces tough opposition,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will vote on Wednesday on a measure to block the sale of tanks and other military equipment worth $1.15 billion to Saudi Arabia, but the measure is not expected to pass despite lawmakers growing frustration with the longtime U.S. ally. The Senates Republican Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, said on Tuesday he would aggressively oppose the effort.  I think its important to the United States to maintain as good a relationship with Saudi Arabia as possible, and I hope well defeat the resolution of disapproval of the arms sale, McConnell told reporters, calling Saudi Arabia a good ally. The Pentagon announced on Aug. 9 that the State Department had approved the potential sale of more than 130 Abrams battle tanks, 20 armored recovery vehicles and other equipment to Saudi Arabia. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency said General Dynamics Corp would be the principal contractor for the sale. A bipartisan group of senators, led by Republican Rand Paul and Democrat Chris Murphy, introduced a joint resolution seeking to block the arms deal, expressing concern that Saudi-led air strikes had killed civilians in Yemen, worries that the deal might fuel a regional arms race and concern that Congress was giving up its power to declare war. We should be part of the debate over whether or not we go to war. But then we should debate the practicalities of whether or not its a good idea to be involved in the war in Yemen, Paul told Reuters. Paul said the conflict could lead to instability and perhaps the rise of a militant group in Yemen, as Islamic State did in Syria. The resolution also underscores concerns over what many in Congress see as Riyadhs international promotion of a severe form of Islam they view as hostile to U.S. interests. Weve let them get away with it for years and years. And because theyre less bad than other people in the Middle East, we keep giving them weapons, Paul said. Democratic Representative Ted Lieu and Republican Representative Mick Mulvaney introduced companion legislation on Tuesday seeking to block the sale in the House of Representatives. Lieu in August sent a letter signed by 64 lawmakers asking U.S. President Barack Obama to postpone the sale. Separately, Congress could vote this week to override Obamas promised veto of a measure allowing relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue the Saudi government.

Senators want to change massive new Israel aid package,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. lawmakers launched an effort on Tuesday to modify a $38 billion military aid agreement with Israel by providing more money and easing controls on how it is spent, setting up a showdown with President Barack Obama over the package days after it was signed. Senators Lindsey Graham, Kelly Ayotte, John McCain and Ted Cruz told a news conference they had filed a measure to give Israel an additional $1.5 billion in military aid, while renewing U.S. sanctions on Iran. Republican Senators Mark Kirk, Marco Rubio and Roy Blunt also co-sponsored the bill introduced on Tuesday. Ayotte, McCain, Kirk, Rubio and Blunt all face competitive races for re-election on Nov. 8. Arguing that U.S. law gives Congress control of spending, they objected to a provision preventing Israel from asking for additional funds from Congress after the new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), begins at the end of fiscal 2018. This is a very dramatic moment in the U.S.-Israel relationship between Congress and the state of Israel. Congress is not going to sit on the sidelines, Graham said. The senators also object to Israels agreement to return any money if Congress tries to send it more than $3.8 billion per year before then. Graham said he would introduce legislation to overturn a provision in the agreement that phased out an arrangement that has allowed Israel to spend 26.3 percent of U.S. military aid on its own defense industry instead of on U.S. weapons. U.S. and Israeli officials signed the agreement on Wednesday. The 10-year package is the largest in U.S. history. It was reached after nearly 10 months of negotiations that underscored continuing friction between Obama and Israeli Prime  Minister Netanyahu. But Netanyahu decided it would be best to forge a new arrangement with Obama, who leaves office in January, rather than hoping for better terms from the next U.S. administration, according to officials on both sides. The senators insisted that Netanyahu was forced into signing because Israels arch-enemy Iran is growing stronger as it obtains billions of dollars unfrozen under an international nuclear agreement reached last year. Now is not the time to say that were going to nickel and dime Israel, Graham said. Congressional Republicans strongly oppose the nuclear pact. They angered the White House in 2015 by inviting Netanyahu to give an address to Congress opposing it. They have offered several pieces of legislation to overturn or undermine the nuclear deal, and sought to make it an issue in the 2016 U.S. elections. ",politicsNews,"September 20, 2016 ",1
More than 300 scientists warn over Trump's climate change stance,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hundreds of top scientists warned on Tuesday against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps vow to pull the United States out of the Paris climate-warming accord if elected in November. The 375 members of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, including 30 Nobel Prize winners, said in an open letter that a U.S. abandonment of the agreement would make it far harder to develop global strategies to lessen the impact of global warming. Thus it is of great concern that the Republican nominee for President has advocated U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Accord, the letter said. A Parexit would send a clear signal to the rest of the world: The United States does not care about the global problem of human-caused climate change. You are on your own. Among the signers are biologist E.O. Wilson, physicists Stephen Hawking and Claude Canizares, astrophysicist Simon D.M. White, and Nobel winners Thomas Steitz, Michael Levitt and William Daniel Phillips. The National Academy of Sciences is a private society of scholars who advise the United States on science and  technological matters. The signers of the letter said they did so as individuals and not on behalf of the Academy or their institutions. In Paris last December, almost 200 countries agreed to slash greenhouse gases and keep global temperature rises to well below 2 degrees Celsius. The United States and China, the two largest producers of carbon emissions, ratified the accord this month. Trump will speak at a natural gas industry conference in Pennsylvania on Thursday. A Trump spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. Trump has dismissed manmade climate change as a hoax invented by the Chinese and says he will abandon the Paris agreement if elected. He has vowed to reverse much of the work the administration of President Barack Obama has done to address climate change, including rules to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The Republican Party platform also questions the legality of Obamas executive order ratifying the Paris deal. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is a strong supporter of the Paris accord. ",politicsNews,"September 20, 2016 ",1
Ex-President George W. Bush dips toe into U.S. trade debate,"DALLAS (Reuters) - Former U.S. President George W. Bush on Tuesday entered the debate over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, hosting a forum at his presidential library extolling his successors Asian free trade deal. Bush, who signed several such accords during his two terms in office, met with U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman before the event to promote the strategic benefits of the agreement. President Barack Obama is still pushing for Congress to approve the 12-country TPP following the Nov. 8 presidential election, even though both Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton oppose it.  Bush, who has largely stayed out of the campaign - in which Trumps anti-trade rhetoric fueled his rise to the Republican nomination - did not attend the forum at the George W. Bush Institute in Dallas. Im very grateful for him welcoming me to this institute and having the institute host this important conversation, Froman told the audience of largely business people after his meeting with Bush. And Im very grateful for his support of free trade as well.  Ken Hersh, director of the Bush Institute, called TPP a no-brainer on a whole host of fronts.  The forum followed a similar event on Monday night in Houston where Froman enlisted the help of another Republican free-trader, James Baker, who served the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush as secretary of the Treasury and secretary of state, respectively. Both major party candidates for the presidency oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. And guess what? Theyre both wrong, Baker, 86, said at the Rice University institute that bears his name. Ive often found myself in disagreement with President Obama. But on TPP I am with him, and I am with him 100 percent, Baker added. In a speech at the Houston event, Froman emphasized the need for TPP as a counterbalance to Chinas growing economic and political influence in Asia, citing its own regional trade deal and more assertive stance in the South China Sea.   If we dont act, it will create a vacuum. These economies arent going to stand still. Beijing will step in to fill the void, Froman said.   At the Bush Institute, Susan Schwab, who served as George W. Bushs last trade representative, said failure to pass TPP would mark an abdication of U.S. leadership. There are countries out there that would dearly love to see the United States fall on its face by not enacting, by not ratifying this deal, she said.     ",politicsNews,"September 20, 2016 ",1
Trump Jr. tweet likening Syrian refugees to poisoned Skittles irks candy maker,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The maker of Skittles candies on Tuesday objected to a social media post by Donald Trump Jr. in which the Republican presidential hopefuls son compared admitting Syrian refugees to the United States to eating poisoned pieces of the brightly colored, fruit-flavored treats. Candidate Donald Trump has opposed letting Syrian refugees enter, while his Democratic rival in the Nov. 8 election, Hillary Clinton, has supported accepting some of those fleeing the war-torn country. In a post on Twitter on Monday accompanied by an image of the candy, Donald Trump Jr. wrote, If I had a bowl of Skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? Thats our Syrian refugee problem. A spokeswoman for Skittles maker Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co said the company did not feel Trumps analogy was appropriate. Skittles are candy. Refugees are people, said spokeswoman Michelle Green, adding that the Mars Inc [MARSIW.UL] subsidiary would refrain from further comment, as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing. U.S. admission of Syrian refugees has long been a politically sensitive issue, although the country has admitted far fewer than many close allies. Trump has said violent militants could enter the country posing as refugees. In 2015, Democratic President Barack Obama announced plans  to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees this year, sparking fierce criticism, mostly from Republicans who said the plan could put Americans at risk. His administration announced in August that it would meet that goal. The younger Trumps tweet drew return fire from the Clinton campaign and many Twitter users. Thankful my grandfather was allowed into this country and not compared to a poisonous skittle, Josh Schwerin, a Clinton spokesman, posted on Monday. Twitter user Neal Rogers on Tuesday, tweeted, Id rather die eating a handful of Skittles than live a single day with @realDonaldTrump as president. Trumps running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, hit back at the Skittles criticism in an NBC News interview. It is remarkable to me to see the level of outrage about a metaphor used by (Donald Trump Jr.) when Hillary Clintons calling for a 550 percent increase in the Syrian refugee program, Pence said. A year ago, Clinton said she supported the admission of 65,000 Syrian refugees. The former U.S. secretary of state has not updated that figure in recent months but says all refugees should be vetted. The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Pences remarks. Trump adviser Jack Kingston, a former U.S. congressman from Georgia, also defended the tweet in an interview with MSNBC. What he was doing was making an illustration. I dont think he was comparing refugees to candy at all, he said. The hashtag #SkittlesWelcome was trending on Twitter in the United States, as social media users mocked the tweet.

Trump calls first debate moderator a Democrat; records show otherwise,"(Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump may have gotten it wrong when he said the moderator of the first U.S. presidential debate next week between him and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, is a Democrat. NBCs Lester Holt, who will moderate the debate on Monday, is registered as a Republican, according to voter information on the New York State Board of Elections website. NBC did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday about Holts party affiliation. Trump has said repeatedly the presidential debates will be stacked against him. He said on Fox News on Monday that Holt was a professional but that he was a Democrat, adding that the NBC News anchor may be under pressure after critics accused fellow NBC journalist Matt Lauer of giving Clinton tougher treatment than Trump during a recent forum on defense issues.     Look, its a phony system. Lester is a Democrat. I mean, they are all Democrats. OK? Its a very unfair system, Trump said on the show. Bill OReilly, the Fox News host conducting the interview, said two other debate moderators, ABCs Martha Raddatz and CNNs Anderson Cooper, were also Democrats.  Cooper is registered in New York with no party affiliation, according to the state elections site, which CNN confirmed. ABC did not respond to a request for comment about Raddatzs registration. The fourth presidential debate moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox News, is a registered Democrat in Washington, D.C., according to the Districts elections website. Wallace has said in interviews that he registered with the party so he could vote in primaries in the heavily Democratic District of Columbia. ",politicsNews,"September 20, 2016 ",1
"Skeptical of Russia, Clinton seen going toe-to-toe with Putin","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Hillary Clinton attended her first major White House meeting on Russia in February 2009, the new secretary of state insisted that she wanted to play a leading role in President Barack Obamas effort to reset U.S. relations with Moscow. But while Clinton became implementer-in-chief for one of Obamas signature first-term initiatives, she was consistently more skeptical than most of his top aides about howfar Russian leader Vladimir Putin was prepared to go in turning the page, according to current and former U.S. officials. That stance is indicative of how she would go about dealing with Moscow if she is elected U.S. president on Nov. 8, aides to both Clinton and Obama told Reuters. With U.S. relations with Moscow already plumbing post-Cold War lows, the aides and veteran Russia watchers said she would likely take a harder line than Obama or Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has praised Putin as a strong leader. Dealing with Putin, who is flexing his geopolitical muscle from Ukraine to Syria to cyberspace, will be among Clintons biggest foreign policy challenges  one made more daunting by the personal bad blood between them. Jake Sullivan, a former top State Department aide and now senior Clinton campaign advisor, said Clinton could consider the shipping of lethal arms to Ukraine government forces and the creation of no-fly or safe zones in Syria. Obama has rejected both ideas. While such moves could further stoke tensions and might even face resistance from some U.S. allies, Sullivan said in an interview with Reuters that Clinton could manage ties with Russia effectively because Putin would respect her as U.S. president, her strength, her clarity, her predictability. According to current and former Clinton advisers, she could consider other policy moves such as stiffer sanctions against Russia over Ukraine and doing more to wean Russias neighbors off reliance on Moscows energy supplies. Russia is watching warily. She is not perceived by many people as the Kremlins preferred candidate, said Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a think tank close to the Russian Foreign Ministry. Many here believe that she would be tougher on Russia than Obama, he said.  Clintons first fence-mending effort in March 2009 was not so much a show of strength than of diplomatic clumsiness. She handed Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov a red button that was supposed to have the word reset on it. Instead, it was labeled with the Russian word meaning overcharged. Clintons distrust of Putin deepened, mirrored by his growing list of grievances against her. By the time she prepared to leave the State Department in early 2013, former officials said, she wrote at least two confidential memos to Obama urging a more hard-nosed approach. At the time, many in the presidents inner circle were not convinced the reset had run its course, they said. Since Clintons departure, Putin has reasserted Russia on the world stage, seizing Ukraines Crimea region and intervening militarily in Syrias civil war. U.S. officials have linked the hacking of Democratic Party computers to the Russian government  which the Kremlin denies. Like most national security policies under Obama, the attempt to reset U.S.-Russian relations was managed from the White House by the president himself, along with aides from his 2008 campaign, including Russia specialist Michael McFaul. No one should pretend that this wasnt an Obama-driven policy, said Philip Gordon, Clintons top Europe adviser at the State Department. But its also not as if she went grumpily to the table and was told by the president youre doing it ... She thought it had logic. McFaul, who later became ambassador to Russia, said in an interview that from the first White House meeting on Russia in early 2009 Clinton was skeptical of the prospects for transforming U.S.-Russian relations in a way that some of us aspired to back then.  Two other officials backed up his account.  The first fruits of the reset were promising. Putin had - temporarily, it turned out - stepped down as   president, with the younger, reform-minded Dmitry Medvedev in his place. Obama and Medvedev signed a new strategic nuclear arms control pact, cooperated to sanction Iran for its nuclear program and agreed to let U.S. troops and equipment transit Russia to support a American military surge in Afghanistan.  But after little more than two years, the reset ran out of steam. By mid-2011, it was clear that Putin was returning to the presidency. Clinton first met Putin at his residence outside Moscow in March 2010. She persuaded him to back tougher U.N. sanctions on Iran, according to two people with knowledge of the session. In front of the TV cameras, however, Putin railed against U.S. trade and economic policies as Clinton watched. Clinton and Putin have been exchanging broadsides for nearly a decade. Putin, a former KGBagent, doesnt have a soul, Clinton quipped on the eve of the 2008 New Hampshire presidential primary, riffing off of President George W. Bushs comment seven years earlier that he had looked into Putins eyes and seen his soul. The Russian leader retorted: At a minimum, a head of state should have a head. A U.S. official who was involved in Russia policymaking said Clinton sometimes chose her words poorly, inflaming Russian resentment over its perceived post-Cold War humiliation, a nationalist strain that Putin has long used to his advantage.  She played into that, said the official, who requested anonymity.  The most serious rift of Clintons tenure occurred in late 2011, as crowds filled the streets of Russian cities protesting parliamentary elections marred by allegations of voting fraud. Clinton, in a statement approved by the White House, called the election neither free nor fair. Putin, who was preparing to retake the presidency, accused her of trying to foment a new Russian revolution. A steady slide in contacts between Clinton and the Russian leadership and in overall relations followed. Secretary Clintons views on Russia were always a little harder-edged than President Obamas, said John Beyrle, Obamas first ambassador to Moscow. That partly reflected a splitting up of responsibilities, he said. Obama cooperated with Medvedev; Clinton grappled with Lavrov and Putin. Some Russia watchers say Clintons record was mixed. The reset was the right approach, said Thomas Graham, former Russia adviser under Bushs Republican administration. But he faulted Clinton and Obamas team for not doing more to actively reach out to Putin and open lines of communication. ",politicsNews,"September 20, 2016 ",1
"Clinton, Trump vie for world leaders' attention in New York","NEW YORK (Reuters) - With national security again a major U.S. election issue after bombings in New York and New Jersey, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump sought to burnish their foreign-policy credentials on Monday by meeting world leaders at the United Nations. For Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, it was a return to a role she knows well after she served as President Barack Obamas secretary of state for four years. Trump, the Republican nominee, is a newcomer to the global stage who is hurriedly trying to play catch-up.  In rapid succession, Clinton met briefly with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and then Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Trump also met Sisi minutes after the Egyptian leader spoke with Clinton in the same Manhattan hotel. The meetings came on a day that started with Clinton suggesting Trumps harsh rhetoric toward Muslims aids the Islamic State militant groups recruiting efforts. Trump pushed back, arguing the United States was less safe as a result of Obama and Clintons policies. Security questions arose in each of Mondays bilateral sessions, which took place as world leaders gathered for the U.N. General Assembly, with Clinton and Abe discussing concerns over North Korea and maritime issues involving China.  Clinton and Trump both spoke with Sisi about working more closely with Egypt to combat the Islamic State threat.  Trumps campaign released a statement saying that Trump highlighted how Egypt and the U.S. share a common enemy and the importance of working together in defeating radical Islamic terrorism.  With Clinton, Sisi also discussed his goal of moving Egypt toward a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law and respects human rights and liberties.  Clinton and Poroshenko addressed Russian incursions into Ukrainian territory. Clinton started the session by saying Ukraine faces very real problems and threats from Russian aggression and that she was anxious to know how we can be supportive.  The session also resonated because of Trumps praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month. Trump called Putin a stronger leader than Obama, rattling both Democrats and Republicans in Washington.  The evening was not without drama, starting with Clintons motorcade zooming through packed New York streets at rush hour and then quickly rushing from hotel to hotel. Trump also tried to bolster his foreign policy credentials last month when he went to Mexico to meet President Enrique Pena Nieto, but both sides ended up disagreeing about whether who would pay to build a border wall had been discussed.  Clinton called that episode an embarrassing international incident. ",politicsNews,"September 20, 2016 ",1
"Despite flaws, paperless voting machines remain widespread in the U.S.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One in four registered voters in the United States live in areas that will use electronic voting machines that do not produce a paper backup in the November presidential election despite concerns that they are vulnerable to tampering and malfunctions, according to a Reuters analysis. The lack of a paper trail makes it impossible to independently verify that the aging touch-screen systems are accurate, security experts say, in a year when suspected Russian hackers have penetrated political groups and state voting systems and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has said the election may be rigged. Election officials insist the machines are reliable, but security experts say they are riddled with bugs and security holes that can result in votes being recorded incorrectly. A Reuters analysis of data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Election Assistance Commission and the Verified Voting Foundation watchdog group found that 44 million registered voters, accounting for 25 percent of the total, live in jurisdictions that rely on paperless systems, including millions in contested states such as Georgia, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The picture has improved gradually since the 2008 presidential election, when 31 percent of U.S. voters lived in areas that used paperless touch-screen systems. In 2012, 27 percent lived in jurisdictions that used paperless systems. Clearly we still have a long way to go to ensure that all Americans have access to a form of voting technology they can trust, said Alex Halderman, a University of Michigan computer-science professor who has helped to uncover security flaws on touch-screen systems. (Graphic showing different types of voting systems across the U.S. -- tmsnrt.rs/2cZiKQ5) Most of these machines are nearing the end of their expected life span, making them more vulnerable to problems. And Congress has not authorized money for upgrades since 2002, just after the disputed 2000 presidential recount battle in Florida highlighted flaws in aging punch-card and lever-voting systems. In some states, a divide has emerged between poorer areas that continue to use paperless touch-screen systems and wealthier areas that have bought new optical scan systems that process paper ballots, which many experts say are a better way to ensure accurate elections. In Virginia, for example, counties that still use touch-screen systems have a poverty rate of 23 percent, while those that have switched to optical-scan systems have an average poverty rate of 11 percent. I would have liked to have had the new machines, but the county says we dont have the money, said Patsy Burchett, the top election official in rural Lee County, which has been hit hard by the decline of the coal and tobacco industries and is the poorest county in the state. These machines are on their last legs, she said. U.S. election officials have known about the shortcomings of touch-screen systems since shortly after they were widely adopted in the early 2000s, when researchers showed that vote results could be manipulated with tools as simple as a magnet and a Palm Pilot-style handheld device. The systems haveproduced questionable results in some elections. In Florida, more than 18,000 iVotronic machines did not record a vote in a 2006 congressional race in which the margin of victory was less than 400 votes. In Fairfax County, Virginia, electronic machines subtracted one vote for every hundred cast for one candidate in a 2003 school-board race. More than 4,400 electronic ballots in Carteret County, North Carolina, were lost and never recovered in the 2004 presidential election. Since 2008, states such as Maryland have traded in their touch-screen machines for optical-scan systems. Others like California and Ohio have added printers to their touch-screen machines which produce a backup paper trail, whileWashington and Colorado moved to mail-in ballots.Absentee balloting is also cutting into the use of paperless systems. In 2012, for example, roughly 1 in 10 voters who lived in areas that used paperless systems cast absentee ballots. Election officials say the touch-screen machines that remain in use are more secure now than they were a decade ago whether they are fitted with printers or not, thanks to extensive testing and better poll-worker training. They say that a hacking incident is unlikely because the machines are not connected to the Internet.  Voters should have confidence in whatever systems are being used in their jurisdiction because election officials have taken the necessary steps to secure these systems and ensure the integrity of the process, said Matthew Masterson, a commissioner with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. Although there has so far been no confirmed major incident of U.S. voting machines being hacked, security experts say that those aiming to manipulate votes could spread a virus through memory cards, with no Internet connection needed. The best way to stop that is to switch to paper-based systems, they say. With 55 percent of all U.S. registered voters living in areas that use systems that are no longer in production, according to the Reuters analysis, election officials must rely on a dwindling supply of spare parts. Virginia Beach, Virginia, for example, pulled 32 of its 820 Accuvote TSX touch-screen machines in a 2014 election after residents complained that the machines were registering votes for candidates they didnt support. The city has since purchased a new optical-scan system. Lacking fresh federal funds, some states have opted to upgrade on their own. Louisiana aims to switch to an iPad-based system by 2019, while Los Angeles and Austin, Texas, are designing systems from scratch. Others see no reason to switch. In Georgia, Secretary of State Brian Kemp said he hasnt asked the state legislature for money to replace its fleet of paperless AccuVote TS touch-screen machines. Its working just fine and all these so-called experts that are making these accusations about our system havent seen it, he said. ",politicsNews,"September 20, 2016 ",1
Japan PM stresses importance of TPP trade pact in Clinton meeting,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met U.S. Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Monday and stressed it was important for the United States to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal that she opposes, Japanese officials said. Abe and Clinton met for about 15 minutes at Abes hotel in New York, where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly, the officials said. The meeting was held at Clintons request, they said. The two stressed the importance of strengthening the U.S.-Japan security relationship and both outlined their known positions on the 12-nation TPP, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The pact has been agreed, but not ratified by the United States or Japan. Clinton, the Democratic candidate in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, has opposed the deal, which is unpopular with labor unions and environmental groups, although she championed it while serving as secretary of state. In a speech to U.S. business leaders in New York on Monday, Abe described TPP as a pillar of the U.S. rebalance of policy emphasis to Asia, which comes in response to Chinas rise. Through the TPP, the U.S. can make clear its commitment to playing a leadership role in the growing Asia-Pacific, he said. Japan and the U.S. must each obtain domestic approval of the TPP as soon as possible, Abe said. Success or failure will sway the direction of the global free trade system, and the strategic environment in the Asia-Pacific. Abe said he would pursue TPP approval at an upcoming session of Japans parliament. Japan will spare no effort, and we count on the U.S. to do the same, he said. On Friday, U.S. President Barack Obama engaged Ohio Governor John Kasich, a high-profile political foe, to help press Republicans to approve the TPP before he leaves office in four months. The unusual move is a sign of how the White House intends to make a final full-court push to convince Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress to approve the deal in a lame duck session after the election. The TPP has been pilloried by both Republican and Democratic candidates. Republicans traditionally have backed free trade deals, but their presidential candidate, Donald Trump, has blamed them for U.S. job losses and threatened to tear them up should he win. Abe had no meeting with Trump, who has accused Tokyo of not  pulling its weight in its security alliance with Washington. The Japanese officials said Trump had not requested a meeting.

"U.S., China to step up cooperation on North Korea","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang agreed on Monday to step up cooperation in the United Nations Security Council and in law-enforcement channels after North Koreas fifth nuclear test, the White House said. China and the United States are also targeting the finances of Liaoning Hongxiang Industrial, a Chinese conglomerate headed by a Communist Party cadre, that the Obama administration thinks has a role in assisting North Koreas nuclear program, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. U.N. diplomats say the two countries have started discussions on a possible U.N. sanctions resolution in response to the nuclear test earlier this month, but Beijing has not said directly whether it will support tougher steps against North Korea. Obama met Li on the sidelines of the annual United Nations General Assembly session in New York. Both leaders condemned North Koreas September 9 nuclear test and resolved to strengthen coordination in achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, including by invigorating cooperation in the United Nations Security Council and in law enforcement channels on North Korea, a White House statement said. China is isolated North Koreas most important diplomatic backer and its biggest trading partner. It has been angered by Pyongyangs repeated nuclear and missile tests and signed on to increasingly tough U.N. sanctions, but it has said it believes such steps are not the ultimate answer and called for a return to talks with North Korea. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Japanese counterpart last week China opposes unhelpful unilateral sanctions on North Korea but will work within the United Nations to formulate a response. Washington has pressed Beijing to do more to rein in North Korea. The United States has said it is willing to negotiate with the North if the country commits to get rid of its nuclear weapons, which Pyongyang has refused to do. The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) is preparing as early as this week to announce legal action against Chinese firms suspected of providing financial assistance to Pyongyang, the Journal reported, citing officials familiar with the matter. It said DoJ prosecutors visited Beijing twice last month to make their Chinese counterparts aware of alleged criminal activities being committed by Liaoning Hongxiang Industrial.  A social media post last week from the police in Liaoning, the northeastern border province of China, said they were investigating the firms alleged long-term involvement in serious economic crimes and that relevant suspects were cooperating. A report by Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul and C4ADS in Washington says it identified more than $500 million in trade from January 2011 to September 2015 between the North and the Liaoning Hongxiang Group, which states on its website that it trades heavily with the North. The figure includes more than $360 million in imports from North Korea by one group company, Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co., an industrial machinery and equipment wholesaler. While no judgment is being made on the final use of these funds, trade at this volume is of particular note. By one estimate, this amount would have been almost enough to both fund North Koreas uranium enrichment facilities, and to design, make and test its nuclear weapons, the report said. Certain assets related to the company, its founder and top executive Ma Xiaohong, and some of her relatives and associates, have been frozen by Chinese authorities in recent weeks, according to government and corporate filings cited by the Journal. The Asan report said its trading of goods that could qualify as potential military and nuclear dual-use products under U.S. export restrictions were of particular concern. The companies identified have had dealings with sanctioned North Korean entities, the report said. Chang Yong-seok, senior researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies, Seoul National University, said this case was symbolic and could have real practical impact. This was the U.S. taking China into consideration and working with China.More such cases may follow if the U.S. or South Korea have firm evidence ... Chinese companies that have capacity for producing or securing goods for North Korea may be worried now, he said. Chinas Foreign Ministry said relevant departments were investigating Liaoning Hongxiang Group and were following the provisions of U.N. resolution 2270, which imposed tighter sanctions on North Korea in March in response to its fourth nuclear test in January and the launch of a long-range missile a month later. Representatives of the U.S. Department of Justice and Hongxiang Industrial were unavailable for comment. The Liaoning Hongxiang Group is also heavily involved in North Korea-related shipping, with Ma and other people associated with the group owning and operating a combined fleet of 10 ships that regularly sail between the North and China. Ma, who served on Liaonings Peoples Congress before resigning at the weekend, is described by Chinese media as the most successful businessperson in Dandong involved in cross-border trade with North Korea. Government records say Mas investment in Hongxiang was frozen on Sept. 2. ",politicsNews,"September 19, 2016 ",1
U.S. and China target Chinese firm suspected of North Korean nuclear link: WSJ,"(Reuters) - The United States and China are targeting the finances of Hongxiang Industrial, a Chinese company headed by a Communist Party cadre which the Obama administration thinks has a role in assisting North Koreas nuclear program, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. Police in Liaoning, the northeastern border province of China, started a probe into the firm's alleged long-term involvement in ""serious economic crimes"" over the course of its trading activities, the paper reported.

Most states on track to meet emissions targets they call burden,"LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON(Reuters) - The 27 states challenging Obamas Clean Power Plan in court say the lower emissions levels it would impose are an undue burden. But most are likely to hit them anyway. Already, Arkansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma and South Dakota appear to be meeting the CPPs early targets. And changes in the power market, along with policies favoring clean generation, are propelling most of the rest toward timely compliance, according to researchers, power producers and officials, as well as government filings reviewed by Reuters. We are seeing reductions earlier than we ever expected, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy said in an interview. Its a great sign that the market has already shifted and people are invested in the newer technologies, even while we are in litigation. States engaged in the legal battle that is set for an appellate court hearing later this month say their concerns go beyond whether they can meet the mandate. The states, most of them led by Republican governors, say they object to what they view as federal overreach by Obama and the Democrats and want to maintain flexibility to make energy decisions at the state level that reflect changing market conditions. Cynthia Coffman, attorney general of Colorado, said her states likely ability to comply with the CPPs mandate truly is not the issue. We dont have anything against clean air, Coffman said. That really doesnt factor into my decision to say the federal government has gone beyond its legal authority. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt said that he sees the Clean Power Plan as a form of federal coercion and commandeering of energy policy and that the state should have sovereignty to make decisions for its own markets. The Obama administration finalized the Clean Power Plan in 2015 as a central part of meeting U.S. obligations under the Paris Climate Agreement. In February, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed implementation of the rule pending resolution of the states litigation. Later this month, a panel of the D.C. Circuit Court is scheduled to hear arguments in the case. The CPP sets carbon-reduction goals for each state, but allows states to decide how to meet them. During the early years of implementation, the goals are guidelines intended to put states on track to meet the final deadline of 2030. If a state fails to submit a plan to the EPA by interim deadlines, the agency can impose its own plan on that states power producers. Failure to comply by 2030 could open a state up to administrative penalties and lawsuits. To be sure, some states fighting the mandate would have to drastically change course to meet it. West Virginia, which is leading the legal challenge with Texas, still relies largely on carbon-spewing, coal-fired power. And Wisconsin, North Dakota, Montana and Wyoming have large gaps between their current emissions and the plans mandates. But, in a reflection of how rapidly the power market is shifting, the U.S. governments Energy Information Administration earlier this year reduced its forecast for 2030 power plant carbon emissions by nearly 11 percent, without factoring in reductions that may be generated by the Clean Power Plan. The projection for the nation as a whole would be nearly two-thirds of the CPPs target by 2030, even if the law never takes effect. A 2015 analysis by consulting firm M.J. Bradley & Associates for the Environmental Defense Fund found that 21 of the 27 states suing to block the Clean Power Plan are on track to meet its 2024 targets with existing plants and planned investments. Eighteen states are on track to hit the 2030 targets with no changes to current plans, according to the Bradley analysis, which was filed with the court as part of an amicus brief from the Environmental Defense Fund in support of the government. And the outlook has improved for some states since the Bradley forecast. It didnt expect Arkansas, for example, to meet the 2024 target. But in 2015, after shifting significant energy generation from coal to natural gas, the state reported power plant emissions for the year that were below the 2030 requirement. Some of the states contesting the rules say they object to strict timelines. The CPP is very dramatic in the speed at which it would require things to happen, said Chris Nelson, chairman of the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission. If you let the market play out, those things take care of themselves. Texas also has protested the CPPs timetable, saying it would require the construction of transmission lines that could raise costs for consumers. But the state already has moved heavily into wind and solar in recent years, and is nearing its 2030 goals. John Hall, Texas director for EDF and a former environmental regulator for the state, said Texas could profit from the rule, noting the state ranks at the top of the list of wind energy producers and is making big moves into solar. The CPP would enable Texas to make money by exporting wind and solar electricity, he said. States that export coal or gas-fired power, on the other hand, are concerned about their ability to keep doing so. It is very important that we dont get caught in the fray of an EPA energy policy that dictates what we do as an exporting state, said Stuart Spencer, Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality Associate Director. Whatever happens in court, energy policy will remain a highly charged political issue. Republicans are overwhelmingly opposed to the administrations attempts to curb carbon emissions. When I ran for office, I promised I would do everything in my power to protect coal miners jobs, said West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in a statement to Reuters. I have followed through on that promise. ",politicsNews,"September 18, 2016 ",1
"After bomb blasts, Clinton, Trump trade charges on national security","PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton on Monday accused Republican Donald Trump of aiding Islamic State recruitment, while Trump said she had helped weaken national security as bomb blasts in New York and New Jersey resonated on the U.S. presidential trail. Both candidates for the Nov. 8 election tried to use the weekend attacks to flex their credentials to protect America as world leaders gathered in security-heightened New York for the annual United Nations General Assembly. Clinton said Trumps rhetoric against what he calls radical Islamic terrorism was helping Islamic State recruit more fighters.  We know that a lot of the rhetoric weve heard from Donald Trump has been seized on by terrorists, in particular ISIS, because they are looking to make this into a war against Islam rather than a war against jihadists, she told reporters in White Plains, New York. ISIS is an acronym used for Islamic State. Trump fired back by saying Clinton bore some responsibility for the violence by not persuading President Barack Obama to leave a residual force of U.S. troops in Iraq when she was his secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Obama and the Iraqi government failed to reach agreement at the end of 2011 on extending a U.S.-Iraqi status of forces agreement, and most American troops were withdrawn. Trump has sought to tie Clinton to the decisions of the Obama administration. Her attacks on me are all meant to deflect from her record of unleashing this monster, Trump told a large crowd in Fort Myers, Florida. The campaigns weighed in after the bomb incidents and a stabbing attack at a mall in central Minnesota. In the most serious incident, a bomb went off in New York Citys Chelsea neighborhood on Saturday, injuring 29 people. An unexploded pressure-cooker bomb was found nearby. Earlier that day, a pipe bomb went off in Seaside Park, New Jersey. On Monday, an Afghanistan-born American suspected in some of the incidents was arrested in nearby Linden, New Jersey, after a gunbattle with police. Authorities had said earlier they wanted to question Ahmad Khan Rahami, a 28-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen, about the Chelsea and Seaside Park bombings.   The incidents, just days after the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, put the United States most populous city on edge. Trump, who has in the past talked of the need for a resumption of harsh interrogation tactics like waterboarding for terrorism suspects, said authorities need to get information from the bombing suspect before it comes no longer timely, but that instead he would probably be coddled. Now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And hell probably even have room service knowing the way our country is, he said. At a speech in Philadelphia on Monday, Clinton called for vigilance. This is a fast-moving situation and a sobering reminder that we need steady leadership in a dangerous world, she said. Trump seized on a government report that said 858 immigrants from countries with which the United States has national security concerns who were pegged for deportation were mistakenly granted citizenship. He said the report showed the need for tighter control over who gets into the United States. Immigration security is national security, Trump said in Fort Myers. Peter Feaver, a political science professor at Duke University who worked on the National Security Council under Republican President George W. Bush, said Clinton was trying to argue Trump did not pass the commander in chief test. When bad news happens, she wants to be able to say, this is why you need a steady hand on the tiller, Feaver said. The renewed focus on terrorism came as Clinton and Trump prepared for their first debate next Monday at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, east of the city. With world leaders gathered in New York for the U.N. conclave, Clinton was expected to meet leaders of Japan, Egypt and Ukraine later on Monday, while Trump was expected to meet Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. A U.S.-led coalition has been fighting Islamic State mainly through air strikes in Syria and Iraq. Trump, who has based much of his campaign message on arguing that the United States is no longer safe and that he alone can protect the nation, told Fox News on Monday morning that he expected more attacks.  I think this is something that maybe will ... happen more and more all over the country, he said.  ",politicsNews,"September 19, 2016 ",1
Obama urges China to address industrial excess capacity: White House,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama met Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Monday and urged China to accelerate efforts to address the problem of industrial excess capacity, the White House said.

Senate to vote on Saudi arms sale measure this week: senators,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will vote as soon as Wednesday on a joint resolution seeking to block a $1.15 billion sale of military equipment to Saudi Arabia over concerns about the conflict in Yemen, sponsors of the measure said on Monday. Republican Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee and Democratic Senators Chris Murphy and Al Franken introduced the legislation on Sept. 8. Backers of the joint resolution say it would block the sale of Abrams tanks and other equipment if it were passed by both the Senate and House of Representatives and signed by President Barack Obama. However, any effort to stop the sale would face stiff opposition from the White House, which has already approved the sale, as well as in Congress. The measures backers said that, even if it does not pass, a positive vote or a strong vote would send a strong message about continued U.S. support for Saudi Arabia. Paul and Murphy told a meeting at the Center for the National Interest in Washington on Monday that they have deep concern about the Saudi conflict in Yemen, and think the United States should rethink its automatic support for the Riyadh government. I think holding back the arms may give them a chance to show that they can do better, Paul said. Murphy said supporting Saudi action in Yemen hurts U.S. security. If we are helping to radicalize Yemenis against us, we are participating in the slaughter of civilians, and we are allowing extremist groups that have plans and plots against the United States to grow stronger, how can that be in our security interest? Murphy asked. ",politicsNews,"September 19, 2016 ",1
"Trump gets skewered, Clinton finds support at TV's Emmy awards","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - As the U.S. presidential election draws near, televisions stars didnt hold back on their opinions at Sundays Emmy awards, some taking jabs at Republican nominee Donald Trump while others voiced support for Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton.  During his opening monologue, Emmy host Jimmy Kimmel called out producer Mark Burnett, the producer of reality series The Apprentice and Celebrity Apprentice which Donald Trump hosted, saying who is to blame for the Trump phenomenon? That guy. If Donald Trump gets elected and he builds that wall, the first person we are throwing over it is Mark Burnett, Kimmel said, setting the political tone of the show 50 days before America elects its next president. Burnett, who later accepted the best reality series Emmy for The Voice, joked on stage that he had just received a call from Clinton criticizing Kimmel for giving Trump free publicity on ABC. Im sure Donald was thrilled with him, Im sure hes emailing Jimmy right now saying thanks for the free media, Burnett told reporters backstage. Trump, known for his rapid-fire responses on Twitter, had nothing to say about the Emmys on Sunday night. After winning best comedy actress for a fifth consecutive time for HBOs Veep, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who plays flawed U.S. president Selina Meyer on the show, said I want to personally apologize for the current political climate. I think that Veep has torn down the wall between comedy and politics; our show started out as a political satire but it now feels like a sobering documentary, she said on stage.  Master of None star Aziz Ansari, who penned an essay in June for the New York Times entitled Why Trump Makes Me Scared for My Family, quipped on stage, Ive decided Im going with Trump. Im recommending that we get rid of all Muslim and Mexican people from the ceremony. This would be so much easier at the Oscars, the Muslim Indian-American actor joked, hinting at the controversy over the lack of diversity at films Oscar awards. Mum, dad, you need to be escorted out immediately, he added.  Backstage, Transparent creator Jill Soloway, who won best directing for a comedy series, criticized Trump for other-izing people.  He blames Muslims and Mexicans for problems ... This is other-izing with a capital O. He needs to be called out every chance we get for being one of most dangerous monsters to ever approach our lifetimes, Soloway said.  Saturday Night Live star Kate McKinnon won best supporting comedy actress and thanked Clinton, one of the people she plays on the NBC sketch series, and got a loud cheer from the crowd. In response, Clinton tweeted Congratulations on your Emmy, Kate! Big fan of yours, too, with a photo of McKinnon in character as Clinton. ",politicsNews,"September 19, 2016 ",1
Charlotte not budging on ordinance that spurred North Carolina bathroom law,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - The mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina, refused on Monday to back off an ordinance that had aimed to expand anti-discrimination protections for gay and transgender people in the states largest city but also sparked a controversial state law. The Republican leaders of North Carolinas legislature said in a statement late on Sunday they believed their colleagues would support repealing the law that voided the city ordinance - if Charlotte made the first move.    North Carolinas Republican governor and lawmakers blame Charlotte for spurring the state measure, which has drawn rebuke from major companies and sports organizations since it was passed in March.  The state law, known as House Bill 2, requires transgender people to use publicly owned bathrooms that correspond with the gender on their birth certificate and bars local ordinances protecting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people from discrimination. A spokesman for Governor Pat McCrory told local media last week McCrory would call a special session for legislators to consider a repeal of H.B. 2 if Charlotte rescinded its ordinance. But Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts, a Democrat, said the city had no plans to reconsider the ordinance at a council meeting Monday night. We appreciate the state wanting to find a solution to the challenges we are facing and applaud the governor for recognizing the state should overturn H.B. 2, which the state can do at any time without any action from the City of Charlotte, Roberts said in a statement. Calls for a repeal of the state law mounted last week after the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) pulled a total of 17 championship sporting events from North Carolina in protest of it. Previously, the National Basketball Association relocated its 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte. Entertainers, including Bruce Springsteen, canceled concerts and companies such as Deutsche Bank scrapped plans to add jobs in the state over objections to the law. Senate leader Phil Berger on Monday questioned whether Roberts was seeking to prolong this debate for political reasons  regardless of the impact on Charlotte and our states business community. LGBT advocates applauded the Charlotte mayor for standing firm, while some business, tourism and hospitality groups urged elected officials to find a compromise to end the economic fallout. An Elon University Poll released on Monday found that almost half of likely voters in the state oppose H.B. 2. But the survey also showed McCrory leading Democratic challenger Roy Cooper by about 49 percent to 46 percent and indicated that some opponents of the law still planned to vote for the incumbent.

"Clinton, Trump to both meet with Egyptian president at U.N.","WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (Reuters) - An adviser to U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps campaign said on Sunday that Trump will meet with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Monday during the United Nations General Assembly, just as Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, is also scheduled to do.  Clinton, who faces Trump in the Nov. 8 election, announced last week that she would meet both with Sisi and Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko in bilateral sessions expected to take place late on Monday. A foreign policy advisor to Trump, Walid Phares, told Reuters on Sunday that Trump would also have talks with Sisi on the same day. For Trump, a New York real estate magnate and reality-TV show host who has never held political office, it marks the second time in recent weeks he has tried to burnish his foreign-policy credentials to compete with Clinton, the former Secretary of State under President Barack Obama and a U.S. Senator from New York.  Trump ventured to Mexico late last month to meet with President Enrique Pena Nieto to discuss border security between the two nations.  But afterward, both sides quickly accused the other of not accurately representing the scope of the conversations, with Trump insisting that the subject of which country would pay for a proposed wall between the two nations never came up, and Pena Nieto saying that his country would never agree to finance it. Egypt remains in flux after the countrys chaotic revolution in 2011 that deposed President Hosni Mubarak, a movement that the Obama administration supported. Then-Secretary Clinton has since written that she advised a more conservative approach than the White House ultimately took toward Mubaraks exit. Egypts Islamist President, Mohamad Morsi, was eventually supplanted by Sisi, the nations former defense minister and a secularist, in 2013. Some Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have since accused the Obama administration of abandoning its support of Egypts government in its battle against Islamic militants.  Trump has called for aggressive measures in combating the threat of Islamic State forces in Iraq and Syria and has proposed blocking immigrants from countries that he says pose a threat to the United States. Earlier in his campaign, he suggested banning all Muslims from entering the country. Clintons meeting with Ukraine President Poroshenko also is likely to be provocative given the reportedly close ties between Trumps campaign and the administration of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula, considered part of Ukraine, in 2014.  ",politicsNews,"September 18, 2016 ",1
Obama tells Clinton fundraiser U.S. still grapples with powerful women,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. society is uncomfortable with powerful women and that is why the United States has not yet elected a woman president, President Barack Obama said on Sunday. Obama, who is eager to see fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton succeed him in office, told a fundraiser for her in New York that the election between his former secretary of state and Republican businessman Donald Trump should not be close. However, political polarization in the country would make it tight, he said. The first African-American U.S. president then told the group of donors why he thought a woman had never held the office.  Theres a reason why we havent had a woman president, he said. We as a society still grapple with what it means to see powerful women. And it still troubles us in a lot of ways, unfairly. And that expresses itself in all sorts of ways. Obama has often spoken about the role of strong women in his life, including his mother, grandmother, wife and daughters.  Polls have tightened between Clinton, a former U.S. senator and first lady, and Trump, a real-estate tycoon.  This should not be a close election, but it will be, Obama said. And the reason it will be is not because of Hillarys flaws, but rather because, structurally, weve become a very polarized society, he said. The president has not hidden his disdain for Trump, who was one of the leaders of the movement that questioned whether Obama was born in the United States. Trump conceded on Friday that Obama was U.S. born. Obama told the donors that Trump was unlike the two candidates he faced in the 2008 and 2012 general elections. When I ran against John McCain, we had deep differences, but I couldnt say that he was not qualified to be president of the United States, Obama said of his 2008 opponent.  I couldnt say that electing Mitt Romney would be an unmitigated disaster. This guy (Trump) is not qualified to be president. ",politicsNews,"September 19, 2016 ",1
"As 'Bridgegate' trial begins, New Jersey's Christie remains focus","NEW YORK (Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is not expected to attend the trial this week of two former associates charged in the 2013 Bridgegate scandal, but the failed Republican presidential hopefuls shadow will loom over the proceedings. Opening statements are scheduled for Monday in federal court in Newark, New Jersey. Bill Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly are charged with conspiracy and fraud in a nine-count indictment alleging they arranged lane closings that caused gridlock on the heavily traveled George Washington Bridge. The resulting traffic delayed commuters for hours and left emergency vehicles slow in responding to 911 calls. Prosecutors said the two defendants planned the lane closures to take revenge on a mayor who refused to endorse Christie for re-election. The governor, at one time a leading Republican presidential hopeful, has not been charged in the scandal that nevertheless helped torpedo his hopes for nomination to the White House in 2016. In the three years since the scandal broke, Christie has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the plan to disrupt traffic on the worlds busiest road bridge, despite speculation to the contrary. The trial could finally provide a definitive answer to the question of whether he knew about the alleged plot, and if so, when. Bridgegate took place after Democratic Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich declined to endorse the governors reelection campaign in 2013. Christie was seeking support from local mayors to demonstrate bipartisan backing for a Republican governor in a Democratic-leaning state, part of an effort to position himself for a 2016 White House bid. Prosecutors say the lane closures were ordered in September 2013 by Kelly, Christies then deputy chief of staff; Baroni, then deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey; and David Wildstein, another Christie ally at the Port Authority who has since pleaded guilty.  The GW carries more than 250,000 vehicles a day across the Hudson River between New Jersey and Manhattan. The trio concocted a cover story, saying the closure was part of a traffic study, prosecutors contend. The shutdown lasted four days, while Baroni and Wildstein ignored increasingly frantic messages from the mayor, according to prosecutors. The ruse fell apart under scrutiny from journalists and the Democratic-controlled state legislature. In January 2014, emails and text messages were publicly disclosed that showed the officials involvement, including an Aug. 13, 2013, email in which Kelly told Wildstein: Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee. Wildstein, who is expected to be a star government witness, has previously said there is evidence that Christie was aware of the lane closures when they occurred. Jurors also may hear from Kelly and Baroni, as lawyers for both defendants have said they plan to testify in their own defense. The defense has suggested it will point the finger at others, including Christie, in arguing that Kelly and Baroni would never have acted on their own. In a pretrial motion, a lawyer for Baroni revealed that a former Christie aide said in a text message that the governor flat-out lied when he said during a 2013 press conference that none of his senior staff were involved in the scandal.  A spokesman for the governor has said the text message does not disprove Christies contention that he was unaware of the plot. Since abandoning his own candidacy for president, Christie has become one of Republican nominee Donald Trumps most visible supporters. ",politicsNews,"September 18, 2016 ",1

Trump VP Pence says he views Cheney as a role model,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, said he views former vice president Dick Cheney as a role model for the No. 2 job in the administration. I frankly hold Dick Cheney in really high regard in his role as vice president and as an American, Pence said in an interview on ABCs This Week that was taped on Saturday and aired on Sunday. Vice President Cheney had experience in Congress as I do and he was very active in working with members of the House and the Senate, Pence said. Cheney, vice president to Republican George W. Bush, was known for wielding strong influence in the administration, particularly in Bushs first term. Cheney was a forceful advocate of the decision to invade Iraq and some aides to Bush have said they believed he wielded too much power. Pence said he had spoken with Trump about areas he would focus on as vice president but said he did not want to discuss their private conversations. Cheney has said he will support Trump in the Nov. 8 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton. ",politicsNews,"September 18, 2016 ",1
Kaine accuses Trump of inciting violence against Clinton,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine on Sunday accused Donald Trump of inciting violence against Hillary Clinton after the Republican candidate said Clintons security detail should be disarmed given her support for tighter gun rules. Kaine, speaking on Fox News Sunday, called Trumps remarks irresponsible. When you look at a series of these comments that hes making, I do believe it is an incite or at a minimum an expression of indifference to whether violence would occur, he said. On Friday, Trump said at a campaign rally that Clintons bodyguards should drop all weapons. They should disarm. Take their guns away, she doesnt want guns. Take them, lets see what happens to her. Take their guns away, okay. It will be very dangerous, he added. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a top adviser to Trump, told Fox News Sunday that Trumps comments had been misinterpreted and demanded that Kaine apologize to Trump for suggesting he had a malicious intent. Senator Kaine should be ashamed of himself for saying that Donald Trump would like to have violence perpetrated against Hillary Clinton but it just shows how desperate and scared the Clinton-Kaine campaign is now because this race now is a dead heat and they cant believe it, Christie said. Trumps vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, called any interpretation of Trumps Friday remarks as a call to violence absolute nonsense. His comment was that if she didnt have all that security, shed change her attitude about the right to keep and bear arms. And Ill bet thats probably true, Pence said on ABCs This Week. Trump was criticized by opponents last month when he suggested that gun rights activists could act to stop Clinton from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices, a comment some interpreted as encouraging a political assassination. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks, Trump told a rally in North Carolina on Aug. 9. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I dont know, he said. In that case, Trumps campaign also insisted that his comments were not intended to incite violence. ",politicsNews,"September 18, 2016 ",1
Republican VP candidate Pence in 'excellent' health: doctor,"(Reuters) - U.S. Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence released a letter from his doctor on Saturday declaring Donald Trumps running mate was in excellent health. You are medically able to maintain your high level of professional work and your physical activity programs without limitations, wrote Michael Busk of the St. Vincent Health, Wellness and Preventative Care Institute in Indianapolis. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has released a note from his doctor saying that he, too, was in excellent health. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election, and her running mate, Tim Kaine, also released medical information this week. The candidates moved to show their physical fitness to run for office after Clinton fell ill on Sunday at an event in New York City, prompting her campaign to disclose that she had been diagnosed with non-contagious, bacterial pneumonia. Busk said in the letter dated Thursday that he last examined Pence, who is the governor of Indiana, in July and has been his doctor since 2013. Pence exercises four days a week, mainly by biking, and takes no medications except for seasonal allergies. He had hernia repair surgery in 2015 and had basal cell carcinomas, a common form of skin cancer, removed in 2002 and 2010, the letter said. Pences father died of a heart attack, the letter said. But it said his father smoked cigarettes, while Pence neither smokes nor drinks alcohol. Pences cardiologists feel he has a very good and strong heart, the letter said.

Race tightens in projected U.S. Electoral College vote: Reuters/Ipsos,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - An election analysis conducted in the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project shows that the race has tightened considerably over the past few weeks, with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump projected to win Florida, an essential battleground state, if the election were held today.   The project, which is based on a weekly tracking poll of more than 15,000 Americans, shows that the 2016 presidential race could end in a photo finish on Nov. 8, with the major-party candidates running nearly even in the Electoral College, the body that ultimately selects the president.   The States of the Nation project, which delivers a weekly tally of support for the candidates in every state, shows that the race has tightened in several traditional battlegrounds. Pennsylvania has been moved from a likely win for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to a tossup; Ohio has been moved from a tossup to a likely win for Clinton. And Florida is now considered a likely win for the Republican nominee, with 50 percent support for Trump to 46 percent support for Clinton. If the election were held today, the project estimates that Clinton has a 60 percent chance of winning by 18 electoral votes. Last week, the project estimated that Clinton had a 83 percent chance of winning the election.  In a separate national Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll, Clinton continues to lead Trump by 4 percentage points, and her recent bout with pneumonia doesnt appear to have scared away her supporters.   The national Sept. 9-15 tracking poll showed that 42 percent of likely voters supported Clinton while 38 percent backed Trump. Clinton, who has mostly led Trump in the poll since the Democratic and Republican national conventions ended in July, regained the advantage this week after her lead briefly faded in late August.      Clinton has an advantage among minorities, women, people who make more than $75,000 a year, and those with moderate political leanings. Trump has an advantage with whites, men, avid churchgoers, and people who are nearing retirement age. Overall, Americans appear to be relatively uninspired by their choices for president with less than eight weeks to go before the election. One out of every five likely voters said they do not support Clinton or Trump for president. In comparison, about one out of every 10 likely voters wouldnt support Obama or Republican challenger Mitt Romney at a similar point in the 2012 presidential campaign. Respondents took the survey after video surfaced of Clinton nearly collapsing at a Sept. 11 memorial in New York on Sunday. Her campaign later said she had a non-contagious, bacterial form of pneumonia. The video sparked a renewed discussion about the health of both candidates. Trump, 70, would be the oldest president to take office, while Clinton, 68, would be the second oldest. Clinton and Trump candidates have since released details of their personal health. Clintons doctors said her physical exam was normal, apart from the pneumonia, and that she was in excellent mental condition. Trump released a note from his doctor saying that he was in excellent physical health. Americans do not appear to be overly concerned with the health of either candidate. According to a separate question in the poll conducted this week, most American adults said the issue would make no difference to how they voted. A negligible percentage of Clinton supporters said concerns about her health made them less likely to vote for her. Clinton led all candidates in a four-way poll of likely voters that included Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Jill Stein of the Green Party. Seven percent of respondents supported Johnson, and 2 percent backed Stein.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English in all 50 states. The latest horserace poll surveyed 1,579 likely voters over the past week. The question on the candidates health surveyed 1,179 American adults from Sept. 12-16. Both polls had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.  National polls have produced varying measurements of support during the 2016 campaign for Clinton and Trump. The differences are partly due to the fact that some polls, like Reuters/Ipsos, try to include only likely voters, while others include all registered voters. The Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll gathers responses every day and reports results twice a week, so it often detects trends in sentiment before most other polls.  Polling aggregators, which calculate averages of major polls, have shown that Clintons lead over Trump has been shrinking this month. The most recent individual polls put Clintons advantage at 1 or 2 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"September 16, 2016 ",1
Trump proposes disarming Clinton guards: 'Let's see what happens to her',"MIAMI (Reuters) - Donald Trump on Friday called for disarming the bodyguards who protect his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, and mused about the consequences of such a move by saying Lets see what happens to her.    The Republican presidential nominee was speaking at a rally in Miami, where he contrasted his supporters, who he said back police and want crime reduced, to Clinton, who he derided as someone who lives behind walls and raises money from hedge funds. I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons. They should disarm. I think they should disarm immediately, what do you think, yes?, he said. Take their guns away, she doesnt want guns. Take them, lets see what happens to her. Take their guns away, okay. It will be very dangerous. Both candidates have been protected by the Secret Service for months, but Trumps latest take on Clintons security detail brought swift denunciations, particularly from Clinton allies.  Tonight, Donald Trump once again alluded to violence against Hillary Clinton, said Elizabeth Shappell, spokeswoman for Correct The Record, a pro-Clinton media watchdog group. This is a truly deplorable comment that betrays our nations most fundamental democratic values, Shappell said in a statement. Stuart Stevens, a Washington-based political consultant who worked on Republican Mitt Romneys 2012 presidential campaign, tweeted: The Secret Service should investigate this threat   Trump made a similar comment about Clinton and her armed protection in May while accepting the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, when he said Clinton would end the U.S. Constitutions Second Amendment, which guarantees the right to bear arms.  Lets see how they feel walking around without their guns or their bodyguards, he told the gun lobby group, speaking about Clinton and her Secret Service detail.  Trump was criticized by opponents last month when he suggested that gun rights activists could act to stop Clinton from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices, a comment some interpreted as encouraging a political assassination. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks, Trump told a rally in North Carolina on Aug. 9. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I dont know, he continued. Clinton has called for tighter access to guns, including universal background checks, but has never said she planned to get rid of the Second Amendment.  Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said Fridays remarks fall into a pattern of Trump inciting people to violence.

"Trump finally backs off Obama birth claim, falsely says Clinton started it","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Friday abandoned his false claim that Barack Obama was not born in the United States after spending five years peddling conspiracy theories that the countrys first African-American president started life as a foreigner. But, never one to let a controversy go without fanning its flames, Trump accused Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival in the Nov. 8 election, of starting the so-called birther movement in her failed 2008 presidential campaign against Obama, a claim that does not stand up to scrutiny. Trump, who has won back some ground in opinion polls and made the White House race more competitive after he went through a summer slump, made his announcement in an attempt to clear the air as he prepares for the first of three televised presidential debates with Clinton on Sept. 26. President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period, said Trump, a real estate developer. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again, he said at an event in Washington at a new Trump International Hotel down the street from the White House. Devoting only about 30 seconds to the subject, Trump did not apologize and did not expand upon his abrupt decision to shift from a stance he held for five years. The New York businessman brought up the birther controversy as far back as 2011, appealing to a right-wing fringe of voters who formed the early base of his support when he launched his presidential bid last year. The birther conspiracy movement is aimed at challenging the legality of Obamas presidency - the U.S Constitution requires that a president be a natural-born citizen. During his presidential campaign, Trump has readily trafficked in other theories that are the stuff of American supermarket tabloids. There was his declaration that the father of U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, one of Trumps many rivals for the Republican nomination, might have been linked to the assassin of President John F. Kennedy. And there was his false claim that thousands of Muslims in Jersey City, New Jersey, cheered when the World Trade Center twin towers collapsed in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In making his announcement on Friday, Trump advanced a widely debunked claim that Clinton and her 2008 campaign had been the original birthers. Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. You know what I mean, he said. His campaign directed reporters to a 2007 memo from then-Clinton adviser Mark Penn, who had encouraged the Clinton campaign to go negative against Obama by saying that his Hawaiian birth and boyhood in Indonesia gave him limited roots in American values and culture. Penn eventually left the Clinton campaign, and his advice was never acted upon.     The Democratic National Committee on Friday condemned Trumps bid to link Clinton to the birther idea. He had the audacity to spout a new lie about the birther movement that he helped to build, it said. Clinton, who leads Trump by 4 percentage points in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, on Friday demanded Trump apologize to the president for having helped spread the birther idea and said Trump had tried to delegitimize our first black president. His campaign was founded on this outrageous lie. There is no erasing it in history, Clinton said in an address to the Black Womens Association in Washington. Clinton seized on the issue after struggling to overcome the fallout from her remark a week ago that half of Trumps supporters are in a basket of deplorables and her initial secrecy about her pneumonia diagnosis. Obama, who produced the longer version of his Hawaiian birth certificate in 2011 to prove doubters wrong, had famously mocked Trump over the issue at a White House Correspondents Association dinner as the wealthy businessman sat in the audience fuming. Still, Trump clung to the contention that Obama was foreign-born, tweeting in August 2012: An extremely credible source has called my office and told me that @BarackObamas birth certificate is a fraud. On Friday, Obama was asked for his reaction to the latest Trump declaration. Im shocked that a question like that has come up at a time when we have so many other things to do. Well, Im not that shocked actually. Its fairly typical. Weve got other things to attend to, he said. I was pretty confident about where I was born. Trumps embrace of the birther movement has incensed black Americans, whose votes Trump has been trying to court. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus held a news conference on Friday to urge African-American voters to resist any temptation to support Trump. Im wondering when this country is going to awaken from this reality show, said Representative Brenda Lawrence, a Democrat. First lady Michelle Obama told a crowd in Fairfax, Virginia, that her husband has set a strong example for those who have doubted whether my husband was even born in this country. Well, during his time in office, I think Barack has answered those questions with the example hes set: by going high when they go low. And hes answered these questions with the progress that weve achieved together, she said. At a rally in Miami later on Friday, Trump pushed back on the idea that he and his supporters were racist, saying that when Democrats are in trouble politically, they always pull out the racist word. He walked out at the rally to a song from the musical Les Miserables in front of a backdrop that read Les Deplorables, a reference to Clintons comment last week about his supporters. The issue of Obamas birthplace has not been a factor in the campaign leading up to the November presidential election, but it resurfaced in recent days, taking the focus of Trumps White House bid away from topics such as immigration, trade and the economy, which he has been using to hit Clinton. Trump revived the birther controversy on Thursday in an interview with The Washington Post when he declined to say whether he believed Obama was born in Hawaii.     Trump had promised a big announcement about the birther issue on Friday, giving the impression it was the purpose of the event at his hotel.  Instead, he held off saying anything about it through more than 20 minutes of endorsements from military veterans. Only then did Trump make a brief statement about Obamas birth. Trump devoted more time at the beginning of the event to talking about his hotel where the event took place. He ignored reporters shouted questions. ",politicsNews,"September 16, 2016 ",1
Popular Michelle Obama courts young people for Clinton,"FAIRFAX, Va. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintons campaign deployed a popular surrogate on Friday to gin up enthusiasm amid young voters who could be critical to victory on Nov. 8: Michelle Obama. The U.S. first lady and wife of President Barack Obama, who won the White House in 2008 and 2012 with high levels of support from young voters, told a crowd of students in Virginia that they could mean the difference between a Clinton win or a loss to Republican nominee Donald Trump. Lets be clear, elections arent just about who votes, but who doesnt vote. And that is especially true for young people like all of you, she said, noting that voters under the age of 30 provided the margin of victory for Obama in the swing states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida and Virginia in 2012. Without those votes, Barack would have lost those states and he definitely would have lost that election. Period, end of story, she said. A New York Times/CBS poll this week showed Clinton with more support from people under 30 than Trump but still well below the levels Obama achieved.  Though she has not yet been a frequent presence on the 2016 campaign trail, Mrs. Obama has proven to be an especially powerful advocate for Clinton, her husbands one-time rival. Her speech in support of Clinton at the Democratic convention in July was praised as one of the best of that event. Im inspired, she said, listing Clintons positions in public service and rejecting arguments that Clinton was not an inspiring figure. The current first lady praised the former first lady as one of the most qualified people for the office of president in history. So we cannot afford to squander this opportunity, particularly given the alternative.Because here is what we know: that being president isnt anything like reality TV,  Mrs. Obama said, referring to Trump, a former reality television host. A president could not just pop off when making life or death decisions about war and peace, she said without naming Trump.   Mrs. Obama noted that the country was in a time of transition, just like her family, which was about to move into a new house. She joked that they had to make sure the White House was cleaned up so they could get their security deposit back. Then she referred to the transition in 2008 with a dig at Trump for questioning whether Barack Obama was born in Hawaii. On Friday he finally conceded that Obama was U.S. born. There were those who questioned, and continued to question for the past eight years, up through this very day, whether my husband was even born in this country, she said to boos. I think Barack has answered those questions with the example hes set: by going high when they go low. ",politicsNews,"September 16, 2016 ",1
U.S. presidential debate rules out third party candidates,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein have failed to quality for the first planned U.S. presidential debate on Sept. 26, the Commission on Presidential Debates said on Friday. The commission, citing the averages the various candidates have achieved in selected polls, confirmed that Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton had met the criteria. It also said that the vice presidential running mates of the two leading candidates were the only two to qualify for the vice presidential debate set for Oct. 4. The first presidential debate will be held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York and the vice presidential debate at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. Using the average of five national polls, Clinton scored 43 percent, Trump 40.4 percent, Johnson 8.4 percent and Stein 3.2 percent, the commission said. Selection for the debates requires at least 15 percent support. Johnson and Stein were both constitutionally eligible and had ballot access in enough states to theoretically win an electoral college majority, but missed the polling threshold. Steins campaign website said she and her running mate Ajamu Baraka will both attend the first presidential debate, and urged supporters to join them. The campaign said it might ask supporters to attempt to escort the candidates into the debate in an action that may lead to arrest  it is possible but not definite. There will be actions you can take with us at Hofstra that do not risk arrest. The campaign said it is organizing nonviolent civil resistance training for this. Johnson said in a statement that: I would say Im surprised that the CPD has chosen to exclude me from the first debate, but Im not. The commission was a private organization created by the Republican and Democratic parties for the clear purpose of taking control of the only nationally televised presidential debates voters will see, Johnson said. The last time a third-party candidate was allowed to participate in the televised debates was in 1992, when Ross Perot met the requirements running as an independent.

Cavani strikes back with four goals as PSG sink Caen,"PARIS (Reuters) - Edinson Cavani silenced his critics when he scored four goals in Paris St Germains 6-0 victory at Caen in Ligue 1 on Friday.     The Uruguay striker, who wasted a handful of chances in the French champions 1-1 home draw against Arsenal in the Champions League on Tuesday, found the back of the net four times before the break in a one-sided encounter.     The result meant that PSG, who had bagged only one point from their last two league encounters, move to the top of the standings with 10 points from five games.    Monaco, Girondins de Bordeaux and Nice, among others, could take over at the top depending on Saturdays results.    Cavani opened the scoring after 12 minutes when he latched onto a Maxwell cross from the left and doubled the tally from the penalty spot after Syam Ben Youssef fouled Lucas in the box. Maxwell again set up Cavani for the third, the forward tapping in from a cross at the near post seven minutes from the break.   Cavani added a fourth on the stroke of halftime, poking the ball home from Thomas Meuniers cross. Unai Emerys sides domination continued after the break as Lucas fired home from just outside the box in the 67th.    Forward Jean-Kevin Augustin added a sixth, converting Adrien Radiots assist 11 minutes from time. Monaco take on Stade Rennais and Bordeaux host Angers on Saturday.

Obama enlists Republican Kasich to push for TPP trade deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ohios Republican governor, John Kasich, took over the White House briefing lectern on Friday to praise the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, an unusual move that shows how hard President Barack Obama will push for the trade deals approval. Obama, a Democrat who is leaving office in four months, met with the governor, who fell short in his bid to be the Republican presidential candidate, in the White House Oval Office to discuss strategies for overcoming domestic political angst over the TPP. The unlikely partnership comes as the White House makes a final full-court push to persuade Republican congressional leaders to approve the deal in a lame duck session after the Nov. 8 election. Both Republican and Democratic candidates have pilloried the TPP. We cannot get to the point in America that because a Democrat wants something, you cant agree with them, Kasich said in an impassioned plea to Republican lawmakers to back the deal, which is a key part of Obamas foreign policy legacy. Kasich said the deal is vital for the U.S. economy and also to counter China and Russia, and said business leaders need to apply pressure on lawmakers to approve it. Right now, China is pushing hard to create their own trade agreement, Obama told reporters in the Oval Office ahead of the meeting, saying U.S. businesses were at risk of being cut out of Asia, the worlds fastest-growing market. I promise you that Chinas not going to be setting up a bunch of rules that are going to be to the advantage of American companies and American businesses, Obama said. Other business and political leaders also attended the meeting, including former Republican Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, International Business Machines Corp Chief Executive Officer Virginia Rometty and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Republicans traditionally have backed free trade deals, but the partys presidential candidate, Donald Trump, has blamed the agreements for U.S. job losses and threatened to tear them up should he win. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the TPP would not get a Senate vote this year, and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan has said he does not see enough votes for it to pass. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has also opposed the deal, which is unpopular with labor unions and environmental groups. Obama has said he hopes opposition cools after the election. The White House has pointed to opinion polls showing most Americans support trade as a sign that the TPP could still squeak through Congress. If youre frustrated about rules of trade that disadvantage America, if youre frustrated about jobs being shipped overseas ... then you want to get this thing passed, Obama told reporters. On his final trip to Asia as president earlier this month, Obama spent time reassuring nervous partners that the United States would finalize the TPP. But on Friday, Vietnams parliament indicated it would not ratify the deal quickly. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Vietnams decision was not a setback. I think the real stumbling block, the real impediment, the obstacle here is (the U.S.) Congress, Earnest said, noting there was every indication that Vietnam would proceed as long as Congress approved the TPP.

Mexico president following California marijuana vote: state lawmaker," (This Sept 15 story corrects asked in first paragraph to raised with California lawmakers) By Gabriel Stargardter MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, who has proposed liberalizing his countrys drug laws, privately raised with California lawmakers visiting Mexico a state measure to legalize recreational marijuana, a state legislator said on Thursday. A delegation of California Democratic lawmakers visiting Mexico talked for an hour on Wednesday with Pena Nieto about trade and the states border with Mexico. During the meeting, Pena Nieto brought up the November ballot measure without getting into details, California state Senator Ben Allen said in an interview. But theyre clearly paying close attention, he added. If California votes to create a legal cannabis market, it would place great pressure on Mexico, which is mired in combating its vast drug-trafficking networks, to follow suit.  There was no mention of the California marijuana initiative in the presidencys report on the meeting, and Pena Nietos office did not immediately respond to request for comment. Pena Nieto has said the United States and Mexico should not pursue diverging policies on marijuana legislation and in April proposed a bill to allow Mexicans to carry up to an ounce of marijuana has stalled in Congress. Californias proposal would allow people over 21 years to possess up to an ounce of marijuana for private use and establish a system to license, regulate and tax sales of cannabis.  Recent polls show a majority of Californians favor legalizing marijuana. Four U.S. states plus the District of Columbia already allow recreational use for adults. Voters in several more states, including the southern border state of Arizona, will consider similar legislation in November. Long regarded as a conservative on drug policy, Pena Nieto has modified his stance since he took office in 2012, reflecting growing Latin American disenchantment with the war on drugs. A bill to legalize medical marijuana remains in Congress.  Ethan Nadelmann, the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, said he eventually expects Mexico to be swayed by the fiscal opportunities of regulated cannabis, which he believes could earn California around $1 billion a year in tax revenue.

"California governor signs epinephrine bill, blasts Mylan","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown on Friday signed a bill to allow businesses across the state to carry epinephrine auto-injectors, but sharply admonished drugmaker Mylan NL over its recent price increases. Mylan has been widely criticized, including by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, for raising the price of EpiPens, which are carried by people with life-threatening allergies. The company, which acquired the product in 2007, recently raised the list price for a pair of EpiPen auto-injectors to $600. The price has been rising from a cost of about $100 in 2008. A probe into EpiPen pricing by a U.S. Senate subcommittee was announced on Sept. 7. Browns decision on Friday highlights the predicament facing allergy advocates, who strongly support epinephrine access legislation but have criticized Mylans pricing.  Over two dozen U.S. states have passed laws similar to Californias authorizing businesses to stock epinephrine, according to advocacy group Food Allergy Research & Education.  Brown said he was signing the bill because EpiPens save lives, but that he strongly objected to Mylans pricing. State government cannot stop unconscionable price increases, but it can shed light on such rapacious corporate behavior, Brown said in a statement. A Mylan representative could not immediately be reached for comment. EpiPen, which has annual sales of about $1 billion, delivers a potentially life-saving dose of epinephrine by injection into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions, including to peanuts and bee stings. Mylan owns 94 percent of the market for such auto-injected devices.     In response to the furor over pricing, Mylan last month said it would sell its own generic version of EpiPen for $300.

"In Pennsylvania Senate race, unfamiliar battle lines on gun rights","PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - As he seeks re-election to his U.S. Senate seat this November, Pennsylvanias Pat Toomey can make an unusual claim. He is the sole Republican nationwide running with the endorsement of top U.S. gun control advocates Gabby Giffords and Michael Bloomberg. That pair of endorsements could give the first-term senator an edge over Democratic challenger Katie McGinty, a former environmental official in the White House and the Pennsylvania governors office. The race is one of a handful of close contests on Nov. 8 that could determine whether Republicans, currently with a 54-46 majority, maintain control of the Senate. Both candidates are targeting educated moderate voters, particularly in the Philadelphia suburbs, many of whom may be turned off by the rhetoric of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, according to political analysts in Pennsylvania. McGinty, who calls her support of gun control measures stronger than Toomeys, is working hard to dismiss his endorsements from Giffords and Bloomberg, and has touted her own endorsement by a Pennsylvania anti-gun violence group. Giffords, considered a hero by many gun control advocates, is a Democratic former U.S. congresswoman from Arizona who survived being shot in a 2011 assassination attempt and has become an activist for gun restrictions. Bloomberg is the billionaire former New York City mayor who considered a run for the presidency this year and, since leaving office, has focused much of his energy on gun control. McGinty has called Toomeys commitment to gun safety paper thin and notes that the Republican incumbent received an A rating from the influential National Rifle Association gun rights lobbying group during his first Senate run in 2010. The issue of gun rights is potent in a nation where the right to keep and bear arms is enshrined in Constitutions Second Amendment. The NRA opposes candidates who support gun control efforts including restricting the types of firearms people can own or expanding background checks required for gun buyers. Many Republicans side with the NRA, while many Democrats support gun control. Opinion polls show Toomeys race as virtually tied, even as Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads Trump by several percentage points in a state that has voted Democratic in the past six presidential contests, starting in 1992. Pennsylvania is home both to rural communities where hunting is a popular pastime and big cities including Philadelphia and Pittsburgh where crime and gun violence are major concerns. Shifting attitudes on guns in the state have emboldened both parties in Pennsylvania to distance themselves from the NRAs stance opposing almost any effort to restrict gun rights. The states law mandating background checks for private handgun sales already goes beyond federal law, said Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania has a very substantial hunting and fishing culture, Madonna said. But hunters arent opposed to that. Toomeys position on guns sets him apart from most of his Republican U.S. Senate counterparts, as he tries to attract moderates while keeping conservative voters in his column. In a telephone interview, Toomey said the Giffords and Bloomberg endorsements recognized that what I did was a very hard thing to do politically. He also emphasized his belief that most gun owners share his position. Im a strong Second Amendment supporter, Toomey said. I see no contradiction between that support and insisting on background checks, so that people whove got no right to the Second Amendment because theyre dangerous criminals or theyre dangerously mentally ill or theyre terrorists, should be denied a firearm any way we can. Giffords has also endorsed Illinois Senator Mark Kirk, another Republican running for re-election, though Bloomberg has not weighed in on that race. In an email, McGinty told Reuters Toomey is no moderate when it comes to gun violence. Time and again, he has sided with the gun lobby instead of doing whats right to keep communities safe, McGinty said. Pat Toomey has completely run away from legislation to expand background checks, since it failed to pass the Senate three years ago. Toomey made headlines in 2013 following an elementary school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, when he and Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia introduced legislation to expand background checks for gun buyers nationwide. That legislation, fiercely opposed by the NRA, failed in the Senate, but Toomey gained praise from Democrats for bucking the majority of his party. He voted for a similar bill after the mass shooting last year in San Bernardino, California, and supported Republican-backed legislation in Congress this year following the Orlando nightclub shooting to restrict access to firearms for people on official terrorism watch lists. McGinty backed a stricter Democratic-backed version. None of the measures passed. McGinty, who called Toomeys gun control positions weak, favors more sweeping restrictions such as bans on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips that Toomey opposes. In a recent television ad, McGinty used a clip of Toomey telling voters this summer that he had a perfect record with the NRA. The NRA has not yet released ratings or issued an endorsement in the race. Toomey called McGinty a political opportunist and again pointed to his support from Giffords and Bloomberg. The idea that somehow theyve all got it wrong and Katie McGinty, my opponent, has it right is just laughable, he said.

Polling places become battleground in U.S. voting rights fight,"LINCOLN PARK, Ga. (Reuters) - Louis Brooks, 87, has walked to cast a vote at his neighborhood polling place in Georgias predominantly black Lincoln Park neighborhood for five decades. But not this year. Brooks says he will not vote in the presidential election for the first time he can remember after local officials moved the polling station more than 2 miles (3 km) away as part of a plan to cut the number of voting sites in Upson County. I cant get there. I cant drive, and its too far to walk, said Brooks, a black retired mill worker and long-time Democratic Party supporter. He said he does not know how to vote by mail and doesnt know anyone who can give him a ride. A Reuters survey found local governments in nearly a dozen, mostly Republican-dominated counties in Georgia have adopted plans to reduce the number of voting stations, citing cost savings and efficiency. In seven of those counties, African-Americans, who traditionally back Democrats, comprised at least a quarter of the population, and in several counties the changes will disproportionately affect black voters.At least three other counties in Georgia dropped consolidation plans under public pressure. While polling place cutbacks are on the rise across the country, including in some Democratic-run areas, the Souths history of racial discrimination has made the region a focus of concern for voting rights advocates. Activists see the voting place reductions as another front in the fight over Republican-sponsored statewide voting laws such as stricter ID requirements that disproportionately affect minority and poorer voters who tend to vote for the Democratic Party. Several of these have recently been struck down by courts that ruled they were designed to hinder minority voting.  There is a history in those states of using different strategies to cut voting in minority communities, said Leah Aden, senior counsel at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Legal Defense and Education Fund. Hogwash, said Robert Haney, chairman of the Upson County Board of Elections, denying that race was a factor in his boards decision. Nobody is trying to keep anybody from voting, said Haney, adding that officials would send a ballot to the home of anyone who needed it. He said the cut in polling sites from nine to four was designed to increase efficiency by closing low-turnout sites, saving about $20,000. The Nov. 8 election will be the first presidential contest since the Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that Georgia and all or parts of 14 other states with a history of racial discrimination no longer need federal approval for election law changes like polling place consolidations. Since the court ruling, the Reuters survey found, more than two dozen local governments in eight of those states have implemented new cuts in polling places.Two thirds of those were met with public opposition. Four of the states - Arizona, Georgia, Florida and North Carolina - could be election battlegrounds in the fight for the White House and control of the U.S. Senate. This is part of the story of voting in the South, saidWillie Williams, a black small business owner from Daphne, Alabama, where polling stations were cut to two from five during last months municipal elections over the objections of black voters. Williams, who still keeps his fathers receipt for his poll tax - the tax some blacks in the South had to pay to qualify to vote before civil rights laws in the 1960s eliminated it - says the reduction wasjust another tool in the tool kit for shaving off minority votes. Daphne city officials denied any racial motivation, saying the changes were meant to improve safety and create better access and parking for voters. Still, Isela Gutierrez, a research director at the liberal group Democracy North Carolina, says the effects of such cutbacks can be wide ranging. The elections boards arent lying when they say some of these locations have low turnout and it makes better administrative sense to close them - but the impact can be disastrous. Numerous academic studies have found people are less likely to vote the farther they must travel and the longer they must wait in line, which becomes more likely with fewer voting sites. Some of these changes individually may affect only a small number of voters, but in the aggregate across the country it will be a very large number of voters, said Danielle Lang, voting rights counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington-based voting rights and campaign finance group. The issue gained prominence in a March primary in Arizonas Maricopa County, where more than 30 percent of residents are Hispanic. A decision to slash polling places left voters in lines for up to five hours. Republican county officials said they misjudged turnout. Georgia has been an epicenter for efforts to reduce polling places since the Supreme Court decision. And in that state,which has not backed a Democrat in a presidential election since 1992, polls show Republican Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in a close battle for the presidency that could be decided by turnout of minority voters. If you want to restrict voter turnout in minority and disadvantaged communities, a good way is to move a polling place somewhere they cant get to, said Stacey Abrams, Democraticleader in the Georgia state legislature. Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said race was being unfairly inserted into the debate on polling place changes. Its election officials making adjustments based on the changing ways people are voting, he said.  A Reuters analysis, using voter registration lists for 2012 and 2016, found at least two Georgia counties where the changes disproportionately affect blacks. A consolidation plan in Macon-Bibb County closed six polling places in black-majority neighborhoods, and only two in white majority areas. McDuffie Countys decision to eliminate three polling places means two-thirds of the countys black voters, and one-third of its white voters, will now vote in one location. Other changes have had little impact on minority voters. In Georgias Lumpkin County, for example, where blacks are just 2 percent of the population, officials consolidated seven polling locations into one to make the county compliant with federal disability laws. Voting rights groups in several states have tried to form patchwork networks to track the changes, which are not well publicized, and then fight back where necessary with threats of lawsuits, petition drives or complaints to federal officials. In Upson County, Haney said, the elections board dropped a proposal to close a polling site in heavily black Salem, a sparsely populated rural area, after residents pointed out the hardship of traveling an extra 10 miles (16 km) or more. But the Lincoln Park site, which had just 230 voters cast a ballot in person on Election Day 2012, was more easily combined with a polling place in the center of the nearby town of Thomaston, he said. Kay King, the only African-American member of the elections board in Upson County and the only one to vote against the voting site closures, said she knew it meant some Lincoln Park residents would not be able to vote. They walk to the store, they walk to church - when you dont have transportation to get to something like this, it makes you not want to do it, you just throw your hands up, she said.

London's Muslim mayor backs Clinton for U.S. president,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Londons first Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan, voiced support for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Thursday, warning that anti-Muslim views like those espoused by Republican Donald Trump plays into the hands of Islamic State. During a stop in Chicago on his first visit to the United States, Khan said he was a big fan of Clinton and hoped she would win the presidential election in November. Shes arguably the most experienced candidate to run to be the president, Khan told reporters following a speech to more than 250 academics, diplomats and business people. As the father of two daughters, I think the message it sends when the most powerful politician in the world is a woman is phenomenal, and hope she wins, said Khan, who as mayor of London is arguably one the most influential member of his faith in western Europe. Immediately after taking office in May, Khan tangled with Trump over his proposed ban on allowing Muslim immigrants and refugees into America, deriding his plan as ignorant. During his roughly 45-minute speech before the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Khan did not mention Trump by name but attacked the positions the New York developer has staked, such as tightening Muslim immigration into the United States. I think to suggest somehow that Muslims arent welcome in the U.S.A., to suggest somehow that being a Muslim isnt compatible with being western, unintentionally plays into the hands of daesh or so-called ISIS, Khan said. Trump has offered an evolving stance on Muslim immigration into the United States since his original December 2015 call for a ban on Muslims entering the country. Earlier this summer, he voiced support for limiting the ban to only countries with known terrorist links. Last month, he appeared to moderate somewhat on an outright ban by touting the idea of the United States undertaking extreme vetting of incoming Muslim immigrants, refugees or visitors.

Obama has 'better things to do' than comment on birther issue,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday said he had better things to do than comment on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps announcement about the so-called birther question over Obamas citizenship.

Trump plans to address Obamas citizenship on Friday, a day after he refused in a newspaper interview to say whether he believed Obama was born in the United States.

Trump scales back tax cuts in new economic plan," (The September 15 story was refiled to correct to $4.4 trillion tax cut, not cost of plan in third paragraph) By Emily Stephenson and Alana Wise (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump unveiled a plan on Thursday for $4.4 trillion in tax cuts, offering less generous tax breaks than his original $10 trillion plan but proposing to cut the current top rate for the wealthiest taxpayers. Trumps proposal, which he detailed in a speech in New York, would reduce the top individual rate to 33 percent from the current 39.6 percent. It would raise the standard deduction and cap itemized deductions, which he said would reduce tax loopholes. Trump said his plan would not add to the federal deficit. Trump said the $4.4 trillion tax cut would actually cost less, about $2.6 trillion, under a mechanism known as dynamic scoring, which assumes that tax cuts will lead to faster growth,which in turn would allow at least some of the tax breaks to pay for themselves. Trump also offered a Penny Plan for cutting federal spending. He said he would shrink government programs outside of defense by 1 percent each year. But entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare would be shielded from any cuts. The original tax plan laid out by the New York businessman last September was criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike for its costly price tag. Democrat Hillary Clinton, who will face Trump in the Nov. 8 election, denounced it as catering to the very wealthy and ignoring the working class. Some economists also questioned the assumptions underpinning the plan he outlined on Thursday. In his speech to the Economic Club of New York, Trump predicted his updated package to reduce taxes, curb government regulation and take a tougher stance on negotiating trade agreements would produce annual economic growth of 3.5 percent. Everything that is broken today can be fixed, and every failure can be turned into a great success, Trump said. He added the plan would create 25 million jobs over a decade. Trump set 4 percent as a goal for economic growth, in a message reminiscent of that of his former Republican rival Jeb Bush. The U.S. economy last achieved 4 percent growth during the administration of Democratic President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. The economy grew 2.4 percent last year. Oren Cass, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute and domestic policy director of Republican Mitt Romneys 2012 presidential bid, said the plan for 1 percent cuts in some programs would not be enough to pay for Trumps proposals. It doesnt square, Cass said. The penny plan is an idea thats been out there for a while, but it does touch entitlement spending as well. Maya MacGuineas, president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, welcomed the scaling back of Trumps original tax-cut proposals but said the plan would still leave the country on an unsustainable budget path. Hes moving in the right direction by pursuing a less costly tax plan and identifying some spending cuts to help pay for it. But the plan appears to rely on rosy assumptions and murky policy changes, she said in a statement. Other groups have predicted more adverse effects from Trumps policies. Earlier this week, global economic research firm Oxford Economics projected the U.S. economy could be $1 trillion smaller than otherwise expected in 2021 if Trump becomes president.

U.S. tax avoidance clampdown a potential headache for Apple,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple Inc and other U.S. multinationals will face new curbs on tax loopholes under a rule imposed by Washington on Thursday, part of a scramble among governments worldwide to bolster their corporate tax bases. Acting shortly after a European Union grab for billions of dollars in back taxes from Apple, the U.S. Treasury said it was tightening restrictions on companies use of foreign tax credits to reduce what they owe in U.S. taxes. We are closing another tax loophole that contributes to the erosion of our tax base, Treasury Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy Mark Mazur said in a statement.  The fight for multinational tax revenues escalated on Aug. 30 when the EU ruled Ireland was giving improper state aid to Apple in the form of a deal for low taxes. The EU ordered Apple to pay Ireland 13 billion euros ($14.6 billion) in back taxes, prompting U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to express concern the EU ruling could undermine the U.S. tax base. Analysts have speculated whether Apple would be able to cut its U.S. tax bill by claiming foreign tax credits for its extra tax bill in Ireland.  Under normal circumstances, U.S. companies can reduce the taxes they owe the U.S. government by the value of the tax credits they claim for taxes paid abroad on foreign profits. No U.S. tax is due on those profits until they are brought into the United States, or repatriated. The new rule will prevent companies faced with back tax bills from splitting, a strategy that allows companies to bring foreign tax credits into the United States without repatriating the income from which they were derived. Apple had no comment on Treasurys tax notice. The technology giant is not the only U.S. company in the crosshairs of EU state aid investigations. Starbucks Corp has been ordered to pay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) to the Dutch state, while Amazon.com Inc and McDonalds Corp are under investigation by the EUs executive arm. The new rule was likely to ratchet up transatlantic tensions over corporate taxes while eliminating one more strategy U.S. companies can use to cushion the blow from increasingly aggressive EU tax collection efforts. The tax notice specifically cited European Union state aid investigations as a risk to U.S. revenues. The Treasury had no comment on whether its notice would have an impact on Apple directly, but a spokesperson said the notice applies to all companies required by a foreign government to pay additional taxes, including those hit by state-aid cases.

Apple tax row raises $2.1 trillion question for forex traders,"LONDON (Reuters) - If the fallout from a huge EU tax bill handed to Apple includes a push to encourage U.S. firms to bring more profits onshore, recent history suggests the impact for the dollar can only be positive.  U.S. presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have both promised to take steps that would encourage major companies to bring home more of the estimated $2.1 trillion in as-yet-untaxed income they hold offshore.  That amount compares to the roughly $300 billion brought back in 2005 under George W. Bushs Homeland Investment Act (HIA), which slashed the effective tax rate on repatriated funds from 35 percent to 5.25 percent.  As this graphic tmsnrt.rs/2cymacf shows, the dollar rose around 10 percent that year against both the euro and the basket of currencies that measures its broader strength, even if analysts still argue about how far that move was driven by the tax scheme.  Against the yen in the same period it rose 15 percent.   The fact that U.S. corporations hold larger cash piles offshore than ever is a reason why a new repatriation tax holiday could be a bigger boost for the dollar than in 2005, Morgan Stanley said in a report in July.  Though we stress the headline number for offshore earnings overstates the unhedged foreign currency amount, which is relevant for FX markets. The U.S. bank also lays out tables of data that it says show where the most money has accumulated. Some 56 percent of funds have been reinvested in Europe, including 12 and 19 percent in Ireland and the Netherlands respectively, compared to 7 percent each in traditional tax havens like Bermuda or Singapore. But a trawl through the accounts of the biggest U.S. corporate holders of funds oversees suggests that much of these funds are held in dollars - meaning little or no money would have to be exchanged from, say, euros into dollars.  Apple, for example, said last year its $186.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings.  As of June 30, 92 percent of Microsofts $113 billion was in U.S. government and agency securities, corporate debt or mortgage-backed securities. Given that in 2004 only around $300 billion of an estimated $500 billion in untaxed offshore funds were brought home, that suggests many firms repatriations might not involve any foreign exchange at all. Citigroup chief currency strategist Steven Englander said that even the simple return of dollars to the United States is likely to have a big impact on the currency.  The dollar money would come back into U.S. equity markets quicker than the non-dollar cash, he said.  It would be very good for U.S. equity markets and would probably attract foreign money into the U.S., pushing up U.S. yields in a risk-friendly way. It would be very dollar-positive. Englander, who also studied the issue in detail the last time a new repatriation act was being talked up in 2011, says the figure for the amount currently being held abroad is something like $2.5 trillion. Converting even a small share of that huge sum from foreign currencies could be significant. No one knows the currency breakdown for sure. 80 percent in dollars sounds reasonable. So 20 percent of $2.5 trillion is a big number, he added. ",politicsNews,"September 15, 2016 ",1
U.S. lawmakers ask Wells about taking back bonuses linked to scam case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Five Democratic U.S. Senators have asked Wells Fargo if it plans to take back bonuses and other compensation to executives linked to the 2 million phony bank accounts that employees created to meet sales quotas. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators announced last week that they had reached a $185 million settlement with the bank over the scam. ...We write to ask whether the Board of Directors will invoke Wells Fargos clawback authority to recover any of the compensation the company has provided to its senior executives, including Carrie Tolstedt, the former senior executive vice president of community banking, they wrote in a letter dated Thursday and released on Friday. The five - Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren, Ohios Sherrod Brown, Rhode Islands Jack Reed, New Jerseys Robert Menendez, and Oregons Jeff Merkley - said Wells Fargo has cause to claw back money under a policy it instituted after the 2007-09 financial crisis. These clawback provisions are designed to prevent exactly what happened with Ms. Toldstedt: Shareholders and consumers bearing the burden of bank misconduct while senior executives walk away with multimillion-dollar awards based on what the company later finds out are fraudulent practices, they wrote. Toldstedt led the bank division running the incentive program that pushed the employees to create fake accounts under real customers names, often hurting those customers credit scores, and received more than $20 million in annual bonuses between 2010 and 2015, they wrote. Wells CEO John Stumpf will testify on Tuesday before the Banking Committee, where Brown is the most senior Democrat. ",politicsNews,"September 16, 2016 ",1
U.S. House panel slams former NSA contractor Snowden,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S congressional intelligence committee on Thursday issued a scathing report accusing former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden of leaking information that caused tremendous damage to U.S. national security, lying about his background and feuding with co-workers. In a report endorsed by both its Republican and Democratic leaders, the House intelligence committee said Snowden was not a whistleblower as he has claimed.  Most of the material he stole from the NSA was not about invasions of privacy, but revealed intelligence and defense programs of great interest to Americas foreign adversaries, it said. The committee said that while the full scope of damage caused by Snowdens disclosures remains unknown, a review of materials he allegedly compromised makes clear that he handed over secrets that protect American troops overseas and secrets that provide vital defenses against terrorists and nation-states.     The committee released only a four-page summary of what it said was a 36-page investigative report that remains Top Secret, but the summary contained strong words about Snowdens actions and background. The report contains previously unreported allegations about Snowden and his possible motives for taking government secrets. It alleges that Snowden, who took refuge in Moscow after fleeing to Hong Kong, was and remains a serial exaggerator and fabricator. It says his official employment records show that while he claimed to have left U.S. Army basic training because of broken legs, in fact he washed out because of shin splits. The report says Snowden claimed to have obtained a high-school graduation equivalent, but in fact never did. It also says he claimed to have worked as a senior advisor for the CIA when in fact he was an entry-level computer technician. While the report says Snowden stole 1.5 million sensitive documents, other sources who have examined materials he turned over to media outlets say that the total is between 200,000 and 300,000 documents.  Some U.S. officials involved in Snowden-related investigations acknowledge that the U.S. government does not know how many documents Snowden downloaded, and that the 1.5 million figure is an estimate.     The report also disputes Snowdens motives for taking and leaking classified information, saying he got into a workplace spat with NSA managers in June 2012 over how to manage computer updates. It says a contracting officer reprimanded him for failing to follow proper grievance procedures, and he began downloading classified information two weeks later. However, in 2013, Reuters quoted U.S. officials and other sources familiar with the matter as saying that Snowden began downloading such data in April 2012, almost a year earlier than had previously been reported at the time. The issuance of the House committee report coincided with the release of Snowden, a movie directed by Oliver Stone that portrays him as a whistleblower and hero. On Wednesday, prominent human rights advocates urged President Barack Obama to pardon Snowden before leaving office in January. U.S. officials have said Obama is not considering a pardon for Snowden, who is facing U.S. criminal charges for providing classified information to unauthorized persons. Ben Wizner, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union who represents Snowden, dismissed the House committee report as lacking substance.  Wizner said the reports release a day before the Snowden film opens is evidence that people in the intelligence community are taking us seriously, that they are concerned that Oliver Stones movie will help solidify Snowdens image as a true patriot, which he is.

Clinton visits North Carolina in campaign trail return; Trump up in polls,"GREENSBORO, N.C. (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton got back on the campaign trail on Thursday after taking three days off for pneumonia, and the Democratic presidential candidate faced a more challenging political landscape, with Republican rival Donald Trump rising in opinion polls. Senior Clinton aides said they always expected the race to the Nov. 8 election to be close. But it was clear from a raft of new polls that Trump had halted a summer swoon after taking steps to give a less freewheeling, more polished performance on the stump. Clinton, 68, appeared in good health on a visit to her campaign planes press cabin while flying to Greensboro, North Carolina, for a rally where she sought to refocus her campaign on the plight of the working class - which has turned out to be a potent theme for Trump. Leaving the stage to the tune of James Browns I feel good, Clinton told reporters she kept her pneumonia diagnosis last Friday quiet, telling only senior staff, because she thought she would be able to power through the illness and keep campaigning. From my perspective, I thought I was going to be fine and I thought that there was no reason to make a big fuss about it, she said. On Sunday, Clinton nearly collapsed while leaving a ceremony marking the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York. Her illness coincided with a mini-surge by Trump, who has drawn even or taken a slight lead in national polls. Polls in battleground states where the race is likely to be decided showed Trump now leading in Iowa, Ohio, Florida and Nevada, and tied in North Carolina. Following her appearance in North Carolina, Clinton was scheduled to appear at a Washington dinner. Clintons campaign chairman, John Podesta, said the candidate and her aides expected the contest to be close. We always expected the race to tighten up, we still feel like were in a strong position with organizational advantage in Florida and Ohio, Podesta told reporters on Thursday. They call these states battlegrounds for a reason. In a speech at the New York Economic Club, Trump stuck to his script, avoiding the more improvisational style that has produced a cornucopia of controversies. Trump pushed a package of tax cuts he said would help power the U.S. economy to an annual growth rate of 3.5 percent. The New York businessman said his goal would be 4 percent growth, a target originally championed by Republican primary rival Jeb Bush. Trump said the growth would generate 25 million new jobs. His economic package resurrected a decades-old debate on whether tax cuts can generate sustainable growth. But the overarching impression left by his speech was one of Trump talking about substantive issues and avoiding the frivolous. Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist who managed 2004 candidate John Kerrys unsuccessful campaign, said Clinton remained the favorite to win the White House, with demographic changes favoring her over Trump, who is heavily reliant on white voters. What has hurt Clinton, Shrum said, is not the time taken off from the campaign trail but rather her decision to keep her diagnosis secret until forced to disclose it - which reinforced a perception among voters that she has a penchant for secrecy. Fairly or unfairly, what this was taken as was more evidence that she was not transparent and thats what hurts her, Shrum said. She been far more transparent than Trump but she hasnt gotten any credit for it. Democrats have sought to pressure Trump to release his tax returns, but the Republican has said he will not release them until a federal government audit has been completed. Clinton has released her tax records. With the candidates health in the spotlight, Trump, 70, on Thursday released details of a recent physical examination, a day after Clinton released specifics on her medical condition. Trumps campaign said the results of his physical showed the fast-food fan has normal cholesterol with the help of a statin drug, weighs 236 pounds (107 kg) and has normal blood pressure. In a not-so-subtle slap at Clinton, the Trump campaign said his medical report showed he has the stamina to endure  uninterrupted  the rigors of a punishing and unprecedented presidential campaign and, more importantly, the singularly demanding job of president of the United States. Trump also appeared on the Dr. Oz Show to discuss his health in an interview with host Mehmet Oz, a surgeon. Top Clinton aide Jennifer Palmieri said one upside of Clintons unplanned break was the chance to sharpen the final argument Clinton will present to voters in these closing weeks. Our campaign readily admits that running against a candidate as controversial as Donald Trump means it is harder to be heard on what you aspire for the countrys future, and it is incumbent on us to work harder, Palmieri said in a statement. Trump backers on Capitol Hill said they were heartened by the tightening race after a call on Thursday morning with his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, who mapped out what the campaign was doing. She promised a more policy-driven approach from Trump in the races final stretch. The poll numbers are just looking phenomenal as you move away from registered voters to likely voters, Republican U.S. Representative Blake Farenthold of Texas said.

Trump believes Obama was born in the United States: campaign,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, one of the leaders of the birther movement that questioned President Barack Obamas U.S. citizenship, believes Obama was born in the United States, the Trump campaign said in a statement on Thursday. In an interview with the Washington Post released earlier in the day, Trump declined to say whether he believed Obama was born in Hawaii. Ill answer that question at the right time. I just dont want to answer it yet, Trump told the newspaper. Those comments drew criticism from Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who expressed dismay at Trumps response during remarks to a gathering of Hispanic leaders in Washington. He still wouldnt say Hawaii. He still wouldnt say America. This man wants to be our next president? Clinton said.  When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry? Now hes tried to reset himself and his campaign many times. This is the best he can do. This is who he is, she said. A few years into his presidency, Obama, the first African American to win the White House, released a longer version of his birth certificate to answer those who suggested he was not U.S. born. In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate, Trump senior communications advisor Jason Miller said in a statement late on Thursday. Having successfully obtained President Obamas birth certificate when others could not, Mr. Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States, he said. Trump has been trying to drum up support among black voters, who overwhelmingly supported Obama in his 2008 and 2012 elections. Many African Americans object to Trumps involvement in the birther movement and the implication that Obamas presidency was illegitimate. ",politicsNews,"September 16, 2016 ",1
Trump biofuel proposals echo those of backer Icahn,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday appeared to weigh into a debate over a controversial U.S. biofuels program with a proposal that would back the position of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, one of his wealthiest backers. In a factsheet on economic policy, the Trump campaign slammed a system of buying and selling biofuel blending credits that it said was bankrupting smaller oil refiners.  The system is a central part of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), the federal program that requires fuel sold in the United States to contain a minimum volume of biofuels, such as ethanol. The comments were later removed from the Trump campaign website. A Trump spokesman said an incorrect version of the factsheet was temporarily placed online. He said Trump remains committed to the Renewable Fuel Standard. It was unclear whether the comments reflected a changed stance from Trump on the countrys more than decade-old RFS program, which he has previously voiced support for. But they echoed the position of Icahn, who recently called on federal regulators to level the playing field in the credits system to favor independent refiners like CVR Energy Inc (CVI.N), in which Icahn is the majority shareholder. Icahns office did not return an email and call when asked to comment. These regulations will give Big Oil an oligopoly by destroying the small to mid-size refineries, the factsheet on Trumps economic policies said. These requirements have turned out to be impossible to meet and are bankrupting many of the small and midsize refineries in this country, it added.    The comments underscored a growing schism within the oil sector pitting large oil companies against independent oil refiners. It also touches on a debate between the interests of Big oil and Big Corn, which strongly backs the mandated use of ethanol in fuels and the credit system to make it work.  The RFS has hurt independent refiners, who do not always have the ability to mix biofuels into their gasoline and diesel before they send it to gas stations. To sell their gasoline without the required biofuel content, they have to buy credits from oil companies that have blended the fuels. Those credits have cost the companies billions of dollars, and 2016 looks set to be the most expensive on record to buy the credits, known as RINs.Philadelphia Energy Solutions Inc PESC.N said last week that it plans to slash benefits and reduce staff, citing the high cost of buying RINs as one of the principal reasons it needed to make the cuts. Independent refiners are pressing environmental regulators for changes to the program that could increase the amount of credits the larger companies need, industry sources have said. For its part, Big Oil favors a repeal of the whole program, rather than a tweak that may land it with increased costs. Biofuels advocates also are against a change to the program.

Trump's son clarifies 'gas chamber' comment after criticism,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump Jr. sought on Thursday to clarify his remark that the media would be warming up the gas chamber if the Republican Party behaved the same way as the Democrats during the U.S. presidential campaign, saying it was a reference to capital punishment, not the Nazi-led Holocaust. Trump, the son of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, spoke to NBC News after the Anti-Defamation League, which combats anti-Semitism, asked him to retract his statement. Trivialization of the Holocaust and gas chambers is NEVER okay, the Anti-Defamation League tweeted. John Podesta, the chair of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintons campaign, told reporters on a call that the wording of Trumps remark was extremely insensitive, divisive and probably pretty consistent with the kind of rhetoric he heard around the house when he was growing up. I think its never acceptable to use language like that, Podesta added. Nazis used gas chambers during World War Two to kill millions of Jews imprisoned in European concentration camps. Trump made the gas chamber remark during an interview with a Philadelphia radio station on Thursday morning to explain how the media would react if the Republican Party had intervened in the nominating contest the way the Democratic Party has been accused of doing to benefit Clinton over former party rival U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. Without the media, this wouldnt even be a contest, but the media has built her up, theyve let her slide on every discrepancy, on every lie, on every DNC game, trying to get Bernie Sanders out of the thing, Trump said.  If Republicans were doing that, theyd be warming up the gas chamber right now, the nominees son added. Trumps campaign said the uproar over the comment was another example of bias among the media covering the presidential campaign. Don Jr. was clearly referring to capital punishment to make the case that the media continues to take words out of context in order to serve as the propaganda arm of the Hillary Clinton campaign, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said in an email.

Clinton says success of Syria agreement rests with Russia,"GREENSBORO, N.C.

Whether or not this works is really up to the Russians, Clinton told reporters after addressing a campaign rally in Greensboro, North Carolina. It is up to whether or not Vladimir Putin decides that its time to do what the Russians can do to bring this conflict into a period where there can be the beginning of political discussions, a hoped-for protective zone for people who are under relentless assault form the air, and a commitment to going after the terrorist groups that pose a threat to everyone.

U.S. lawmakers say Afghanistan corruption threatens future spending,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators questioned State Department officials closely on Thursday about corruption in Afghanistan and said failure to address it could cause them to rethink the billions of dollars the United States spends there each year. I dont know what the political will here in the United States will be to continue to support the Afghans in light of what is going on there, said Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Menendez described himself as someone who has been supportive of U.S. Afghanistan policy, but said he would have a totally different view if the government in Kabul does not act. On Wednesday, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) issued a report that strongly criticized Washington for pouring billions of dollars into Afghanistan with so little oversight that it fueled corruption and undermined the U.S. mission. The United States spends $5 billion per year in Afghanistan, about $4 billion for defense and national security and another $1 billion in civilian assistance, plus billions more for the cost of the thousands of troops and military contractors there. Richard Olson, the State Departments special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, agreed that corruption can undermine governance. But he called Afghan President Ashraf Ghani a committed partner in fighting corruption. Ghani, Olson said, has taken steps including addressing the Kabul Bank scandal, canceling a fuel contract and setting up a monitoring and evaluation committee with experts on anti-corruption. It is a dramatically different situation from what it was prior to 2014, Olson testified.     ",politicsNews,"September 15, 2016 ",1
Globally aligning derivatives rules dominates U.S. confirmation hearing,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Concerns about coordinating U.S. derivatives regulation with that of other countries dominated a Senate committees hearing on Thursday to consider two nominees for seats on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Members of both parties asked the nominees, Chris Brummer, a Georgetown University law professor, and Brian Quintenz, an investment firm founder who once worked for a Republican Representative, about cooperation with other countries during the Agriculture Committee hearing.  The committee will vote on the nominations in a separate business meeting. If approved, the nominations then go to the full Senate. The CFTC oversees the U.S. derivatives market and recently gave swap dealers an extra month to comply with a new cross-border rule on collateral for uncleared swaps, after Asias market froze from uncertainty about the changes. The European Commission announced this summer it was delaying its implementation of similar rules. Both Brummer and Quintenz spoke of the need to build strong relationships with other countries. But Brummer emphasized the U.S. role in leading rulemaking. Overall, I think that its hard...to lead if you dont lead by example. I think if you want to have a cross-border regulatory environment that is high quality then the United States should commit to the highest standards and find those who are like-minded, he said. Meanwhile, Quintenz worried firms could exploit timing gaps between different countries rules implementation for financial gain, calling it regulatory arbitrage. Someone does have to go first but I dont believe thats the full analysis, he said. I believe the full analysis is: after you go first how long will it be until all the jurisdictions move and what is the size of the regulatory arbitrage youre creating? And once other jurisdictions move  will there be regulatory arbitrage going forward? Republican Senator Thom Tillis said that in the current situation its almost like were being penalized for good behavior. Were on time. Some of the other key players are not...Our banking industry is suffering as we move forward with regulations that make us globally make us un-competitive, he said. Separately, at a speech on Thursday, CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad said he had been assured by European counterparts that their delay in implementing their swaps margin rule would be short and he hoped it would be in place by March 1. He added the CFTC will explore actions it could take if the delay stretches on longer. ",politicsNews,"September 15, 2016 ",1
Virginia governor's bid to restore felon voting rights advances,"(Reuters) - The Virginia Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a Republican bid to have Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe held in contempt for his continued effort to restore voting rights to about 206,000 felons. The high court said it would not require McAuliffe to prove that he is complying with its July 22 ruling that struck down his initial blanket attempt to restore felons voting rights. The one-page order also said justices would not let Republican legislative leaders seek more documents through a discovery process. McAuliffes efforts to restore voting rights to felons is seen as a possible aid in tipping Virginia, a swing state in the Nov. 8 presidential election, toward Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Opinion polls show her leading Republican candidate Donald Trump in the state. Republican legislative leaders this month filed a contempt motion against McAuliffe. It came after McAuliffe said he had restored voting rights to almost 13,000 felons on a case-by-case basis after the state Supreme Court blocked his blanket clemency effort. In a statement, McAuliffe said he was pleased by the courts decision. Restoring these Virginians civil rights is morally the right thing to do, he said. McAuliffe has said his original order would move Virginia away from lifetime disenfranchisement that hits African-Americans particularly hard. Many of the convicts who benefited were African-Americans or Latinos, two groups that have voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates in the past. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, won Virginia in 2012 and 2008. ",politicsNews,"September 15, 2016 ",1
"Trump could lose a few pounds, but otherwise healthy: adviser","(Reuters) - Donald Trump knows he could stand to lose a few pounds but otherwise is in great health, campaign adviser Sarah Huckabee Sanders told MSNBC on Wednesday after the Republican presidential candidate filmed a TV segment about his well-being. Trump taped an episode of the Dr. Oz Show in New York that will air on Thursday, in which he gave host Dr. Mehmet Oz a summary of a physical exam conducted last week. Trumps campaign has said he will also release more medical information to the public. The show released a short clip on Wednesday that did not include any medical information. In it, Trump told Oz he had two letters with him showing results of tests conducted last week.  May I see them? Oz, a cardiothoracic surgeon, asked, sitting in a chair next to the 70-year-old New York businessman. Yeah, sure, Trump said, handing over papers he pulled from his jacket pocket. Huckabee Sanders said she did not see the summary Trump showed Oz, but said she knew he got a great report and is in very good health. She said Trumps rigorous campaign schedule showed his stamina. He self-admitted he could lose a few pounds, she said. I think thats most of America, but otherwise hes in incredibly good health.  Trump and Hillary Clinton, 68, the Democrat facing him in the Nov. 8 presidential election, have both promised to release more medical information.  Clinton this week took several days off the campaign trail to recuperate from a bout with pneumonia, after she nearly collapsed on Sunday at a memorial ceremony for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Clinton plans to resume campaigning on Thursday, her spokesman said. Previously, Trumps campaign issued a short letter from his doctor saying he was in excellent health, but without such details as whether he takes any medications. Clinton in 2015 released a two-page letter outlining her own medical condition. ",politicsNews,"September 14, 2016 ",1

Pastor cuts Trump short during anti-Clinton speech in Flint,"FLINT, Mich. (Reuters) - The pastor of a black church in Flint, Michigan, stopped Donald Trump on Wednesday in the midst of his remarks criticizing Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, and said the Republican presidential nominee was not invited to talk about politics. As Trump went after Clinton for her support of global trade deals, pastor Faith Green Timmons interrupted to tell Trump her church had not invited him to give a political speech. Oh, oh, OK, thats good, Trump responded, shuffling papers on his podium at Bethel United Methodist Church. He then made a few remarks about fixing Flints drinking-water issues before departing. Trump was visiting the city to view its water crisis first-hand and extend his recent outreach to African-American voters ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Polls show black voters largely favor Clinton. He held an event at a black church in nearby Detroit earlier this month and has pledged in recent speeches to help the black community, which he has described as being besieged by poverty and crime.  During his remarks on Wednesday, the New York real estate developer was also challenged by some members of the crowd of about 50 people, including a woman who accused him of discriminating against black renters as a landlord in the 1970s. No, I never would, never would, Trump replied. Earlier in the day, he toured Flints water-treatment plant, which has been shut down since lead was found in the water supply. Residents of Flint asked a federal judge on Wednesday to order bottled water or filters be provided to them to prevent further lead exposure, 2-1/2 years after the citys water supply was found to be contaminated.

"U.S., Israel sign $38 billion military aid package","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will give Israel $38 billion in military assistance over the next decade, the largest such aid package in U.S. history, under a landmark agreement signed on Wednesday. The deal, whose details were reported by Reuters earlier, will allow Washingtons chief Middle East ally to upgrade most of its fighter aircraft, improve its ground forces mobility and strengthen its missile defense systems, a senior U.S. official said. While the package constitutes the most U.S. military aid ever given to any country, it entails concessions by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to officials on both sides. Those include Israels promise not to seek additional funds from Congress beyond what will be guaranteed annually in the new package, and to phase out a special arrangement that has allowed Israel to spend part of its U.S. aid on its own defense industry instead of on American-made weapons, the officials said. Nearly 10 months of drawn-out aid negotiations underscored continuing friction between President Barack Obama and Netanyahu over last years U.S.-led nuclear deal with Israels arch-foe Iran, an accord the Israeli leader opposed. The United States and Israel have also been at odds over the Palestinians. But the right-wing Netanyahu decided it would be best to forge a new arrangement with Obama, who leaves office in January, rather than hoping for better terms from the next U.S. administration, according to officials on both sides. A new pact now allows him to avoid uncertainties surrounding the next president, whether Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump, and to give Israels defense establishment the ability to plan ahead. Obamas aides wanted a new deal before his presidency ends, seeing it as an important part of his legacy. Republican critics accuse him of not being attentive enough to Israels security, which the White House strongly denies, and of taking too hard of a line with the Israeli leader. The $38 billion memorandum of understanding covers U.S. fiscal years 2019-2028 and succeeds the current $30 billion MOU signed in 2007, which expires at the end of fiscal 2018. Prime Minister Netanyahu and I are confident that the new MOU will make a significant contribution to Israels security in what remains a dangerous neighborhood, Obama said in a written statement. The agreement was signed at the State Department by U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Shannon and by Jacob Nagel, acting head of Netanyahus national security council. According to a White House fact sheet, the deal includes: -annual payments of $3.3 billion in so-called foreign military financing -$500 million a year for Israeli missile defense funding, the first time this has been formally built into the aid pact. -A phasing-out of a special arrangement that for decades has allowed Israel to use 26.3 percent of the U.S. aid on its own defense industry instead of on American-made weapons. -Elimination of a longstanding provision that has allowed Israel to use about 13 percent of the U.S. aid to buy military fuel. -The funding will allow Israel to update the lions share of its fighter aircraft, including purchasing additional F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Israel is scheduled to receive 33 F-35 aircraft, the first two of which will be delivered in December. ",politicsNews,"September 14, 2016 ",1
U.S. Republican senator moves toward re-election despite Trump tiff,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Another U.S. Republican senator has moved closer to re-election while keeping some distance from Donald Trump, and experts say this suggests the partys presidential candidate may be having little down-ballot impact, at least at the primary stage.  Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire still faces a tough general election challenge on Nov. 8 but she crushed a pro-Trump, Republican challenger in a primary contest on Tuesday, winning close to 80 percent of the vote. Ayotte has refused to endorse Trump although, like a number of Republicans, she has said she will vote for him. Some Republicans, such as Ohio Senator Rob Portman, have endorsed Trump but excluded him from their campaigns. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska won her primary in August although she had said she did not know whether she would vote for Trump. Trump, a New York businessman who has never held elected office, at first criticized Ayotte. Then he changed course early last month and endorsed her, along with fellow Republicans House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator John McCain. With Ayottes victory, all incumbent Republican senators running for re-election have won their primaries this year. This is not uncommon but it is unusual for so many senators to hold their partys presidential nominee at arms length.  U.S. senators serve six-year-terms. One-third of the 100-member Senate faces voters every two years. The outcome so far shows some voters are distinguishing this year between Trump and the rest of the ballot, said Nathan Gonzales, editor of The Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report, a non-partisan newsletter.  His impact has been less dramatic than what was initially expected, but there is still time for things to get worse for the Republican Party, Gonzales said in a telephone interview. At a time when Republicans in presidential primaries basically rejected everybody from the status quo, they are not doing that in Senate or House primaries, Norman Ornstein, a political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, said by telephone. Republicans are still worried that voters who do not like Trump will not turn out to vote for other Republicans in the general election on Nov. 8, Gonzales said.  Is there a Trump drag (on down-ballot candidates)? There doesnt appear to be much of one, said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor at the non-partisan Cook Political Report. Ohios Portman, who has not appeared with Trump on the campaign trail, easily beat his primary opponent and has opened up a lead over his Democratic challenger in the general election. McCain and Ryan have had very public differences of opinion with Trump but they also prevailed in their primary races. Ayotte beat a field of four challengers in New Hampshire, receiving nearly 80 percent of the vote, according to election results posted online by the state.  She must still take on Democratic New Hampshire Governor Maggie Hassan in the general election. Ayotte was leading Hassan by 52 percent to 44 percent in a Sept. 6-8 NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll, according to the website RealClear Politics. I think you probably have a lot of people in the primary who were not going to pay as close attention to what she was saying about Trump, Ornstein said of Ayotte. In the fall it may be a different matter, as certainly Maggie Hassan is going to try to tie her to Trump. ",politicsNews,"September 14, 2016 ",1
Americans blame Washington gridlock for slow economic growth: study,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Americans blame political gridlock in Washington for the countrys declining economic competitiveness and hold both Democrats and Republicans responsible, a Harvard Business School study released on Wednesday found. The study noted that U.S. gross domestic product grew at a rate of about 2 percent since 2000, well below the 3 to 4 percent average in the prior half-century. It said a range of factors including a complicated corporate tax code, tangled immigration system and aging roads contribute to the slow growth.   The study contends that factors including a growing wealth gap, declines in productivity growth and a rise in the number of working-age people neither employed nor seeking jobs show that the U.S. economy is becoming less competitive. A majority of the schools alumni surveyed said they believed the U.S. political system was hurting the economy. That view crossed party lines, with 82 percent of Republicans, 74 percent of independents and 56 percent of Democrats agreeing. Only a minority of members of either party felt that their own party was acting in a way that supported economic growth, said Jan Rivkin, a professor at Harvard Business School and co-author of the report. The survey did not ask whether respondents preferred Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump or Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Some respondents worry that neither candidate for the White House could overcome gridlock in Washington, Rivkin said, adding Anyone elected into the current system would face pressure toward paralysis. A concurrent survey of the general public found smaller, but still significant, numbers blaming the political system for a languishing U.S. economy. Some 49 percent of Republicans, 38 percent of independents and 26 percent of Democrats at large said politics were hurting growth. The study contends partisan gridlock is preventing the federal government from tackling structural problems facing the U.S. economy, and suggested steps to address that gridlock. Among them: Changing rules that allow lawmakers to gerrymander districts to ensure one partys dominance; reforming campaign finance; setting term limits in the House and Senate, and eliminating party control of the federal legislative process.  The study comes a day after the Census Bureau reported median household income surged 5.2 percent last year to $56,500, its highest since 2007. The surveys included responses from 4,807 alumni of Harvard Business School from May 3 through June 6 and 1,048 members of the general public polled June 10-26. The public survey had a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points, margin of error does not apply to the alumni survey as it was not a random sample. ",politicsNews,"September 15, 2016 ",1
"Missouri lawmakers override gun, voter ID vetoes","KANSAS CITY, Mo. (Reuters) - Missouri lawmakers pushed through bills on Wednesday eliminating the need for permits to carry concealed weapons and requiring voters to show a photo identification before casting a ballot, overriding Democratic Governor Jay Nixons vetoes of the bills. Both votes by the Republican-controlled state House and Senate reached the two-thirds majority required to enact legislation over the governors veto. The weapons bill abolished a state law requiring a permit, training and background checks for people who want to carry a concealed weapon in the state.  The House voted 112-41 to override Nixons veto and the Senate voted 24-6. Supporters of the bill said it will make the state safer by allowing more residents to carry firearms in self-defense, while still banning certain criminals and mentally incompetent people from having a gun. In vetoing the bill in July, Nixon said the measure struck an extreme blow to sensible safeguards against gun violence. Earlier on Wednesday, the state Senate voted 24-7 and the House 115-41 to override Nixons veto of a bill requiring voters to produce a government-issued ID instead of less official identification such as a utility bill or bank check. The bill would not take effect until 2017, after this years presidential election, and only if voters in November pass a state constitutional amendment in support of the new law. That is necessary because the Missouri Supreme Court ruled 10 years ago that such a statute violated the existing state constitution. Courts in recent months have blocked voter ID laws passed in several states by Republican-led legislatures after civil rights groups argued the measures were discriminatory against poor and minority voters. In Missouri, voters without a photo ID can still vote if they sign an affidavit swearing that they lack any type of identification. However, election officials can take their picture, and steps must be taken to get a photo ID for later use, with the state covering the cost. Supporters of the bill said it will help prevent voter fraud. Why not have more certainty in the election process? Republican Representative Justin Alferman, the bills main sponsor, said in a statement before the vote. Opponents had argued that the ID requirement places an undue burden on young, minority and low-income voters who tend to support Democratic candidates. Putting additional and unwanted barriers between citizens and their ability to vote is wrong and detrimental to our system of government as a whole, Nixon said in explaining his veto.

"Clinton, Trump move to show medical fitness for White House","WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on Wednesday moved to show their medical fitness for the White House as Clinton released a letter from her doctor declaring her fit for the presidency and Trump taped a TV-segment about his well-being. Clinton, 68, is healthy and fit to serve as president and is currently recovering from non-contagious, bacterial pneumonia, her physician, Dr. Lisa Bardack, said in a letter about the Democratic nominees medical condition released by the campaign. Trump, 70, knows he could stand to lose a few pounds but otherwise is in great health, campaign adviser Sarah Huckabee Sanders told MSNBC on Wednesday after the Republican nominee taped an episode of the Dr. Oz Show in New York that will air on Thursday. Bardack, in her letter about Clinton, wrote: She is recovering well with antibiotics and rest. She continues to remain healthy and fit to serve as President of the United States. The announcements came as Clinton spent a third day resting at her home in Chappaqua, New York, after falling ill on Sunday morning as she left a Sept. 11 memorial in New York City. Video footage taken by a bystander showed Clinton becoming dizzy as she attempted to get into a waiting vehicle. Her campaign said later in the day that the former secretary of state had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. Though senior aides knew about Clintons diagnosis, the delay in public disclosure fueled criticism that she is prone to secrecy and fed unsubstantiated internet rumors that she is hiding a health issue. Bardack said Clintons pneumonia was diagnosed after a chest scan on Friday and that she was prescribed a 10-day course of antibiotics.  Bacterial pneumonia can be treated with antibiotics while viral pneumonia necessitates a different approach, according to Dr. Steve Simpson, acting director of the Division of Pulmonary Disease at the University of Kansas Hospital. Simpson has not evaluated or treated Clinton. Since bacterial pneumonia is not contagious, Clinton was at no risk of transmitting the infection at campaign and fundraising events before or after she was diagnosed. She is scheduled to return to the campaign trail on Thursday. Bardack said Clintons cholesterol and blood pressure are within normal ranges. She had a normal mammogram and breast ultrasound and shows no signs of developing heart disease, which runs in her family. Clinton takes medication for an underactive thyroid, which has been stable for years, Clarinex for her allergies, a vitamin B12 supplement and the blood thinner Coumadin following a 2012 blood clot in her head. In December 2012, as Clinton was near the end of her term as secretary of state, she fell at home and suffered a concussion, developing a blood clot shortly thereafter. Since then, Clintons dosage of Coumadin has been adjusted as needed according to regular lab testing, Bardack said. After consultation with a specialist, a decision was made to not switch Clinton to a newer anticoagulation drug. Bardack had released a two-page assessment of Clintons health in July 2015. Trumps campaign released a brief letter from his personal physician in December 2015 that said he was in astonishingly excellent health but did not provide detail about treatment or medications. Neither candidate has released the type of detailed or voluminous medical records provided by past presidential candidates such as U.S. Senator John McCain, who in 2008 allowed reporters to review 1,173 pages of medical records after concerns were raised about a cancer scare. Trumps campaign has said he will release additional medical information to the public in the coming days. The Dr. Oz Show on Wednesday released a short clip of its Thursday segment with Trump. In it, Trump gives Dr. Mehmet Oz two letters showing the results of medical tests conducted last week. Huckabee Sanders said she did not see the summary Trump showed Oz, but he self-admitted he could lose a few pounds. Trump weighs 267 pounds, according to media reports. That weight would mean Trump, like many Americans but few U.S. presidents, is considered medically obese, according to body mass index standards. Clintons running-mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, 58, also released a physician letter on Wednesday. Dr. Brian Monahan, who oversees the Office of the Attending Physician in the U.S. Congress, said Kaine, as of his last physical last February, was in overall excellent health. Monahan said Kaine was on no medications but recommended a vitamin D supplement. ",politicsNews,"September 14, 2016 ",1
"Powell reveals disgust with Trump, distaste for Clinton in hacked emails","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Secretary of State Colin Powell revealed distaste for both U.S. presidential candidates, but leveled his most pointed criticism at Republican Donald Trump in hacked emails leaked by a group American intelligence officials suspect is linked to Russia. In an email to Reuters on Wednesday, Powell confirmed the authenticity of the thousands of hacked messages but declined further comment. In one of the leaked emails, Powell, a Republican, called Trump a national disgrace and an international pariah who allied himself with racists questioning whether President Barack Obama was born in the United States. When Trump couldnt keep that up, Powell wrote in the hacked message, he said he also wanted to see if the (birth) certificate noted that he was a Muslim. As I have said before, What if he was? Muslims are born as Americans everyday. As for Clinton, Powell said in another email that the Democratic former secretary of state was greedy and had unbridled ambition. The new batch of leaked messages, some from as recent as late August, has renewed concern in Washington about hackers meddling on behalf of Russia in the Nov. 8 election and U.S. politics.  The White House so far has refrained from publicly blaming the attacks on Russia. The United States has not made a formal determination in public about who may or may not be responsible, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters during a daily briefing. The head of the Democratic National Committee said on Tuesday the organization had been hacked by Russian state-sponsored agents who were trying to influence the U.S. presidential election. Some committee documents were leaked in July. In one of the newly leaked messages, from Aug. 21, Powell, the first black U.S. secretary of state, derided Trumps attempt to attract African-American voters. Powell wrote to a friend: There is nothing he can say that will sway black voters so he might as well say it to white folks. He is at 1% black voters and will drop. He takes us for idiots. He can never overcome what he tried to do to Obama with his search for the birth certificate hoping to force Obama out of the Presidency. Or, demanding his school transcripts to see how he got into Harvard-(eg, affirmative action).In the same message, Powell called Trumps claim that within four years he would have 95 percent of blacks voting for him a schizo fantasy. In a July 24, 2014, email, however, Powell made clear his discomfort with Clinton, writing: I would rather not have to vote for her, although she is a friend I respect. A 70-year person with a long track record, unbridled ambition, greedy, not transformational Clinton launched her second bid for the presidency in 2015. In another email, Aug. 18, 2015, he wrote, using her initials, that: Everything HRC touches she kind of screws up with hubris. In some of the thousands of messages posted on the website DCLeaks.com, which include several exchanges with Reuters reporters, the former top diplomat and retired four-star Army general also expressed his displeasure with the Clinton campaigns efforts to equate his use of an AOL email address with her installation of a private server in her home.After it was reported that Clinton had told FBI investigators that Powell had advised her to use a personal address, he lamented that what he called her minions were making a mistake trying to drag me in. Former National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, who served with Powell in Republican George W. Bushs administration, agreed, writing to Powell that: I dont think Hillarys everyone did it, is flying.Powell was harsher in an Aug. 21 message to a friend and former aide, writing: Well, their email ploy this week didnt work and she once again looks shifty if not a liar. Trump folks having fun with her. A Clinton campaign spokesperson declined to comment. Trumps campaign did not respond to a request for comment.  The Association of State Democratic Chairs sent a message, obtained by Politico, to its members on Wednesday warning that hackers are targeting state party officials and have successfully breached and impersonated some of them.

Lawmaker says he misspoke about Republican Party hack,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican congressman Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said on Wednesday that Russians had hacked into Republican National Committee computers, but the RNC denied it and McCaul later told CNN he misspoke. The Russians ... basically have hacked into both parties at the national level. And that gives us all concern about what their motivations are, McCaul told CNN in an interview. The Republican National Committees communications director, Sean Spicer, quickly pushed back on McCauls comments, saying on Twitter that there has been no known breach of Republican networks. Shortly thereafter, CNN.com posted a statement from McCaul clarifying his remarks. I misspoke by asserting that the RNC was hacked. What I had intended to say was that in addition to the DNC hack, Republican political operatives have also been hacked, said McCaul, a U.S representative from Texas. Reuters reported last month that hackers had targeted the computer systems of Republican Party organizations and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. The head of the Democratic National Committee, Donna Brazile, said on Tuesday the organization had been hacked by Russian state-sponsored agents who were trying to influence the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned as DNC chair on the eve of Julys Democratic National Convention after WikiLeaks published a trove of hacked DNC emails that showed party officials favoring eventual nominee Hillary Clinton over Senator Bernie Sanders during the partys nominating contests.

Nearly half of Americans ‘very concerned’ about Clinton emails: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nearly half of American adults are very concerned about two issues that have hounded Hillary Clintons presidential campaign this year: her use of a private email server to conduct government business and donations to her familys charitable foundation, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Wednesday.  Both issues stem from Clintons tenure between 2009 and 2013 as secretary of state, during President Barack Obamas first term. During that time, she used an unauthorized private email server to conduct government business - something that the Federal Bureau of Investigation earlier this summer criticized as extremely careless.  The Clinton Foundations acceptance of donations from foreign governments and corporations while Clinton herself was secretary of state has drawn criticism about possible conflicts of interest. In August, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called on the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate whether Clinton granted any special favors in exchange for those donations. The Sept. 2-11 online poll found that 46 percent of American adults said they were very concerned about Clintons use of a personal email account, while 47 percent said the same about donations from foreign governments or corporations to the Clinton Foundation. The public appears to have mostly responded to these issues along party lines, with nearly twice as many Republicans expressing concern as Democrats. However, a considerable portion of Democrats appear to be just as rattled by the reports.    Among Democrats, 21 percent were very concerned about Clintons emails, and 22 percent were very concerned about the Clinton Foundation donations. Among Clinton supporters, 14 percent said they are very concerned about the emails, and the same proportion said they are concerned about donations. The issues, which have drawn wide attention by the media and by her opponents, may have eroded Clintons popularity, but it is not clear whether they have made a lasting impact on her level of support in the presidential race against Trump, where she holds a small lead.   Since the beginning of August, a growing portion of Americans have expressed a negative view of Clinton. Yet, when asked to pick between her and Trump for president, Americans have given a small, but consistent advantage to Clinton. According to the poll, among the respondents who said they were concerned about the emails, 52 percent said the main reason was because the emails might contain classified information that was vulnerable to hackers. Another 40 percent were mostly concerned that Clinton had violated State Department policies.  Among those who said they were concerned about donations to the Clinton Foundation, 48 percent said they were generally concerned about foreign money being contributed to organizations run by high-ranking politicians, while 38 percent said they were specifically concerned that donors had more access to Clinton while she was serving in the Obama administration. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It asked questions only to those respondents who were aware of the email and the Clinton Foundation issues. There were 2,745 respondents for the email questions, including 1,070 registered Democrats and 944 registered Republicans. There were  2,116 respondents for the Foundation questions, including 817 registered Democrats and 801 registered Republicans.  The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points for the entire sample, and 4 points for the Democrats and Republicans. ",politicsNews,"September 14, 2016 ",1
Mexican band Maná urges Latinos to vote in U.S. election,"(Reuters) - Members of Man, the Spanish-language pop band, are embarking on what they hope will be their most influential series of performances - the U.S. Latino Power Tour - seeking to encourage Latinos to use their power at the polls in the Nov. 8 presidential election. We are so proud, on one hand Latino Power Tour, its a celebration, but were also suggesting for Latinos to use their power with their vote. They can change history in this country, said vocalist Fher Olvera. The tour opened in San Diego on Sept. 9 and is scheduled to end in Los Angeles on Nov. 13. The band, sometimes referred to  as the U2 of Spanish rock, will perform in 18 major arenas across the United States. The band from Guadalajara, Mexico, has always been vocal about denouncing violence and corruption in its home country. Now, in the wake of some unfavorable comments about Mexicans by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump - who has also threatened to expel millions of Mexicans - Man feels its influence can make a difference in the United States as well. Latinos can move the scale of history in the United States, they can rewrite history and I believe they deserve a lot more than what has been given to them, and they have the power, Olvera said in an interview. For the Latino Power Tour, Man will perform a career-spanning set including greatest hits and songs from its ninth studio album, Cama Incendiada (Bed on Fire). It has also partnered with organizations including Voto Latino and local advocates to provide both inspiration and information Latinos might need to make their voices heard in the upcoming election. More than anything, its a huge celebration of the Latino community, said drummer Alex Gonzalez. You know, the Latino community has given so much and has worked so hard here in the United States, developed the country, especially economically. On the other hand also, this tour is to emphasize Latinos to go out and vote.  Man has earned four Grammy Awards, eight Latin Grammy Awards and sold more than 40 million albums.

Clinton Foundation plans to spin off flagship health project,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation would spin off its flagship health project into a completely independent charity if Hillary Clinton were to win the U.S. presidency in November, the charity announced on Wednesday. The Clinton Health Access Initiative, which has focused on reducing the cost of HIV medicine in sub-Saharan Africa, currently accounts for about two thirds of the foundations annual income and expenses, according to disclosures online.  The promise to carve it out of the foundation aims to quash concerns that donors might try to seek special access in a Clinton White House.  Bill and Chelsea Clinton, Hillary Clintons husband and daughter, would step down from the health projects board and the project would no longer use the Clinton name and instead would go by its acronym, CHAI, if the family returned to the White House next year, the announcement said. Clinton has defended her familys philanthropic organizations against accusations by Donald Trump, her Republican rival, and others that wealthy donors, abroad and at home, might expect favorable treatment from the U.S. government. She has said no donor ever received inappropriate favors, but her staff have said she recognizes reorganization would be necessary to avoid any appearance of conflicts of interests.  On Tuesday, New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said his office had opened an inquiry into the Donald J. Trump Foundation to ensure the Republican presidential nominees charity was complying with state laws governing nonprofits. The inquiry followed reports by The Washington Post regarding Trumps Foundation and his contributions to the charity. He has refused to release his tax returns, which would show charitable giving. Long-time Clinton associates Bruce Lindsey, Ira Magaziner and Maggie Williams would also step down from CHAIs board, and the remaining board members would replace all five in consultation with global health experts, the charity said.  Magaziner, who has been friends with Bill Clinton since they were students at Oxford University, would remain as the projects chief executive. The board would draft a succession plan by the end of the year, the announcement said. If Secretary Clinton is elected president, the changes outlined here will be implemented and CHAI would become an organization completely independent of the Clinton Foundation, the statement said. Bill Clinton set up the foundation as he prepared to leave the White House in 2001. Hillary Clinton joined its board after  leaving the U.S. State Department in 2013 but stepped down last year to seek the presidency.  The foundation announced last month that it would no longer accept donations from foreigners or corporations for its other work besides CHAI, and said it would close overseas fundraising arms in Sweden and the United Kingdom.

"U.S. Democratic Party says more documents leaked, blames Russians"," (This 13th September story was refiled to correct the headline and first paragraph to make clear more documents released from earlier breach, not a new hack) WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the Democratic National Committee said on Tuesday the organization had been hacked by Russian state-sponsored agents who were trying to influence the U.S. presidential election and they may have released more documents after a similar leak in July roiled the party. A link to the documents was posted on WikiLeaks Twitter account and attributed to alleged hacker Guccifer 2.0. The release came during a presentation on Tuesday from a person speaking on behalf of Guccifer 2.0 at a London cyber security conference, Politico reported. Reuters could not immediately access the documents.  Theres one person who stands to benefit from these criminal acts, and thats (Republican presidential nominee) Donald Trump, DNC interim Chair Donna Brazile said in a statement. Not only has Trump embraced (Russian President Vladimir)Putin, he publicly encouraged further Russian espionage to help his campaign, she said. Trump in July invited Russia to dig up emails from Clintons time as secretary of state, prompting Democrats to accuse him of urging foreigners to spy on Americans. He later said he was speaking sarcastically. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned as DNC chair on the eve of Julys Democratic National Convention after WikiLeaks published an earlier trove of hacked DNC emails that showed party officials favoring eventual nominee Hillary Clinton over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders during the partys nominating contests. Three other senior officials also stepped down from the DNC after the leak. We have been anticipating that an additional batch of documents stolen by Russian agents would be released, said Brazile, who took over from Wasserman Schultz on an interim basis. Democratic Party sources said the party and Clintons presidential campaign were deeply concerned about possible publication by WikiLeaks or other hackers of a new torrent of potentially embarrassing party information ahead of the Nov. 8 election.

New York attorney general opens probe of Trump Foundation,"(Reuters) - New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said on Tuesday he had opened an inquiry into the Donald J. Trump Foundation to ensure the Republican presidential nominees charity was complying with state laws governing nonprofits. Schneiderman, a supporter of Trumps Democratic rival in the presidential race, Hillary Clinton, sued the real estate mogul and his now defunct Trump University for fraud in 2013, seeking $40 million in restitution plus penalties and other costs. In a CNN interview on Tuesday, Schneiderman said his office had now brought Trumps charitable foundation under scrutiny. My interest in this issue really is in my capacity as regulator of nonprofits in New York state. And we have been concerned that the Trump Foundation may have engaged in some impropriety from that point of view, the elected Democratic official said. He added: We have been looking into the Trump Foundation to make sure its complying with the laws that govern charities in New York. He did not elaborate on what wrongdoing Trumps nonprofit might have committed. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung dismissed Schneidermans assertions as entirely motivated by presidential politics, calling the attorney general a partisan hack who has turned a blind eye to the Clinton Foundation for years. Cheung called Schneidermans comments nothing more than another left-wing hit job designed to distract attention from Clintons recent missteps on the campaign trail. Trump has accused Clinton of being corrupted by donors to the Clinton Foundation global charity founded by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, while she was U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Clinton has dismissed Trumps allegation as a political smear. There has been no evidence that foreign donors to the foundation obtained favors from the State Department while Clinton headed the agency. Schneiderman made his remarks when asked on CNN about calls from Democrats in Congress for a federal investigation of a $25,000 donation in 2013 from the Trump Foundation to a political committee supporting Floridas Republican attorney general, Pam Bondi.  Democrats have cited an Associated Press report that Bondi solicited the donation personally, around the time her office was debating whether to join New York states investigation into Trumps real estate training school in Florida. According to the AP, Bondi, who was seeking re-election at the time, broke off the lawsuit deliberations after the check arrived. Bondi, who has endorsed Trump, has called the AP report misleading.

Mylan CEO to testify before House panel over EpiPen pricing,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mylan NL Chief Executive Officer Heather Bresch will appear at a Sept. 21 congressional hearing over price increases for its EpiPen emergency allergy treatment, the U.S. House of Representatives Oversight Committee said in a statement on Wednesday. Mylan has been widely criticized, including by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, for sharply raising the price of EpiPens, which are carried by people with life-threatening allergies. Mylan, which acquired the product in 2007, recently raised the list price for a pair of EpiPen auto-injectors to $600. The price has been rising from a cost of about $100 in 2008.  Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin confirmed that Bresch will attend the hearing. Heather is very good at being able to give an answer without offering much information, said Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat, adding that he will be watching for any other issues that might be raised by the Committee.  A probe into EpiPen pricing by a U.S. Senate subcommittee was announced on Sept. 7. Bresch is the daughter of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia. The House panel co-chairmen, Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz and Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings, noted there is ... justified outrage from families and schools across the country struggling to afford the high cost of EpiPens. The committee planned to look at how to spur competition in the EpiPen market and speed approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of generic alternatives, according to the statement. In response to the furor, Mylan last month said it would sell its own generic version of EpiPen for $300. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, which for years has been working on developing a generic alternative to EpiPen, said last week that it hopes to gain U.S. approval by late 2017 or early 20018. EpiPen, which has annual sales of about $1 billion, delivers a potentially life-saving dose of epinephrine by injection into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions, including to peanuts and bee stings. Mylan owns 94 percent of the market for such auto-injected devices. The committee said it also planned to call as a witness Dr Doug Throckmorton, the FDAs deputy director at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.     ",politicsNews,"September 14, 2016 ",1
Blocking Internet oversight transition a 'gift to Russia': Obama administration,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Delaying or blocking a planned transition of oversight of the Internets technical management from the U.S. to a global community of stakeholders would be a gift to Russia and other authoritarian regimes, a senior Obama administration official said Wednesday. The comments before a congressional panel came as several Republican lawmakers are attempting to thwart the changeover, due to occur on Oct. 1, arguing it would stifle online freedom and has not been appropriately vetted.     I urge you: Do not give a gift to Russia and other authoritarian nations by blocking this transition, Lawrence Strickling, administrator of the U.S. Commerce Departments National Telecommunications and Information Administration, told a Senate subcommittee. The plan, announced in March 2014, to transfer oversight of the nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, is expected to go forward unless Congress votes to block the handover.  The California-based corporation operates the database for domain names such as .com and .net and their corresponding numeric addresses that allow computers to connect. The U.S. Commerce Department currently oversees the Internets management largely because it was invented in the United States. Its contract with ICANN will lapse on October 1. Senator John Thune, a senior Republican from South Dakota, told reporters Tuesday he expected lawmakers would add language to delay the Internet transition to a bill to fund the government past the end of September. Stricklings testimony were an attempt to rebut concerns raised by Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who convened and chaired Wednesdays hearing on the Internet, and other Republicans who have argued in recent weeks that the transition would be a giveaway of Internet control to Russia, China, and other governments that censor Internet content. When ICANN escapes from government authority, ICANN escapes from ... having to worry about protecting your rights or my rights, Cruz said. ICANN does not have the ability to censor the Internet, the corporations CEO Goran Marby said during the hearing. Tech companies, technical experts, academics, have said the transition is overdue and necessary to keep the Internet open and globally oriented, and that the proposal includes safeguards against any potential abuse by any one country. Delaying the transition to the multistakeholder global community may also weaken U.S. credibility in future international negotiations at the United Nations and elsewhere about Internet standards and security, thus empowering countries like Russia and China, experts have said.

Trump’s fate may rest with former supporters of arch-critic Mitt Romney,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (Reuters) - Donald Trumps presidential candidacy has triggered anguished soul searching among many college-educated and affluent Republicans who must decide whether to back him, sit out the election, or do the unthinkable: vote for his opponent, Hillary Clinton. With less than two months to go before the Nov. 8 election, rural, white voters who lack a college degree have flocked to Trump. But his brash style and lack of experience in government are a much tougher sell among well-off Republicans who have long been a backbone of the party, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling and interviews with Republican-leaning white collar professionals. Trumps hopes of capturing the White House may rest on whether he can win over enough of these voters in battleground states such as Ohio, Virginia and Colorado to offset Clintons overwhelming advantages with minority voters, young people, urban voters and women. If you had told me two years ago that I would be voting for Hillary Clinton, I would have said, No freaking way, said Michael Sheehan, chief operating officer of a Columbus-based apparel firm. Sheehan is now leaning toward Clinton, the Democratic nominee, because he worries Trump would damage U.S. relations abroad. Reuters/Ipsos polling shows that Clinton is doing better among affluent and college-educated voters than President Barack Obama did four years ago, even among Republicans. Its a warning  signal for Trump, who has been shunned by blacks, Latinos and millennial voters. In 2012, nearly nine out of every 10 Republicans with a college degree and annual income over $100,000 supported then Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Now, about seven in 10 support Trump. Romney won college-educated voters over Obama by 4 percentage points in 2012, but the Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll showed Clinton with a 48-28 percent advantage among those same voters last month.  The same gap is playing out in key swing states. In Ohio, Clinton has a 47-36 percent edge among the college educated, according to a Monmouth University poll in August.  Its amazing how few Trump supporters Ive run into, said James King, a partner in a prominent Columbus law firm who backed Romney in 2012 but who likely will vote for Clinton. Marsha Blackburn, a congresswoman from Tennessee who is one of Trumps biggest supporters in Washington, said Trumps proposal this week for a child-care tax credit was an example of policies that can appeal to more affluent Republicans.  Trump still needs to keep pushing his economic message, keep talking about national security, keep talking about these issues that are so important to moms, these working-family issues, she told Reuters. Ohio, with its 18 electoral votes, is crucial for Trump and he has campaigned intensively in the state. But in populous, largely suburban central Ohio, Trump has a tougher task than in the rural counties that surround it. The local economy skews toward white-collar workers and professionals and does not depend on the manufacturing revival Trump has promised in his Make America Great Again message. Romney, the scion of a wealthy family and former private equity fund manager, was a more natural fit with many Republicans in the area. He epitomized what sometimes has been called the country club Republicans. They favor smaller government, less intrusive regulations and put less weight on conservative social values. Trump, the real-estate magnate from Manhattan, would seem similar, but some Republican professionals in central Ohio cant get past his temperament and comments like the one suggesting illegal immigrants from Mexico are rapists and murderers. Romney himself has been a fierce critic of Trump. Theres no way I could ever vote for that guy, said King, the law firm partner, adding that Trumps criticism of the family of a Muslim soldier, Humayun Khan, who was killed in action, soured him on Trump for good. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll of registered voters last month showed Clinton ahead among white, college-educated voters in Colorado, where she held a 55-23 percent edge; in North Carolina, where she held a 47-40 percent advantage; and in Virginia, where she held a 43-37 percent edge.  Bradley Barbin, a white-collar criminal defense lawyer in Columbus, has decorated the walls of his office with Republican memorabilia stretching back a century. He faults Trump for stirring resentment and for encouraging violence at his rallies. Trump has denied there is significant violence at his events and has blamed the media for exaggerating scuffles with protesters. Barbin said he likely wont back Clinton. Do I know exactly what I am going to do? No. But I do know that Trumps the bigger problem, he said. Among affluent Republicans who do support Trump, several said that whatever reservations they may have about him as a candidate, it was more important to keep Clinton from the presidency. I think shes a bad person, said William Bay, a retired nephrologist who lives in Hilliard, a suburb of Columbus, who lauded Trump as an agent of change. Trumps campaign has long contended there exists a swath of Trump voters who wont talk to the press or pollsters for fear of being demonized, but who will show up at the polls in November. But its also possible that some Republicans, once in the privacy of the voting booth, will go with Clinton because of their concerns about Trump. Barbin, the Columbus defense lawyer, said thats the takeaway from conversations with his peers. We all know, he said, that there are certain people you just cannot give that kind of unfettered power to. You just cant. ",politicsNews,"September 14, 2016 ",1
Clinton server technicians decline questions from U.S. Congress," (This Sept. 13 story corrects bureaus name to Federal Bureau of Investigation in paragraph 6, not Federal Bureau of Information) By Jonathan Allen NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two computer technicians declined to answer questions from U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday about the unauthorized private email system that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton used during her tenure as U.S. secretary of state. Paul Combetta and Bill Thornton repeatedly invoked their constitutional right not to incriminate themselves during about 10 minutes of questioning while under oath before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. A third technician, Bryan Pagliano, declined even to appear, despite a subpoena ordering his testimony. The investigation of Clintons email system has become a troublesome issue for her presidential campaign, with Republican rival Donald Trump saying a recent finding by federal investigators that she mishandled classified government secrets in her email should disqualify her from office. Brian Fallon, a Clinton campaign spokesman, said in a statement it was up to the technicians whether to cooperate, but we certainly are not prevailing upon anyone to cooperate with this sham of an inquiry. Clinton has said she regrets using the system in her New York homes basement for work. Voters have said in surveys the decision contributes to a feeling she is untrustworthy. Federal Bureau of Investigation director James Comey said in July there was evidence that Clinton and her staff may have broken the law with their extremely careless handling of classified government secrets, but concluded there were insufficient grounds to prosecute. Combetta and Thornton work for Platte River Networks, the Denver technology firm that managed Clintons email servers soon after she left the State Department in 2013. They repeatedly invoked their Fifth Amendment protection from self-incrimination to each question from lawmakers. Jason Chaffetz, the committees Republican chairman, eventually excused them out of what he called respect for their rights. Elijah Cummings, the committees most senior Democratic member, expressed sympathy for the technicians, saying the Republicans were only trying to use them to embarrass Clinton. Chaffetz criticized Pagliano, who was paid by Clinton to manage her server while she was the nations top diplomat, for not complying with the subpoena and said the committee would decide after the hearing whether to punish him.  Pagliano was given a form of immunity from prosecution in 2015 for cooperating with the FBI as it looked into the mishandling of classified information over the server, but has otherwise cited the Fifth Amendment in declining to provide information to lawmakers. His attorney did not respond to questions. A fourth witness, Justin Cooper, testified for more than two hours about his role setting up the email system in 2009 while he worked a Clinton family aide. Clinton used an AT&T email account while a senator and a presidential candidate in 2008. Cooper said there was a desire to change her email address because a number of people had received her email address over the course of those activities. A summary of the FBIs findings showed Combetta saying he used software called BleachBit to delete an archive of Clintons work emails around the same time as a conference call with Clintons lawyers, despite lawmakers seeking the records through a subpoena.

Secretary of State John Kerry presented the new target of 110,000 in the 2017 fiscal year starting Oct. 1, up from 85,000 in 2016, during a closed session to members of the House and Senate judiciary committees on Tuesday, according to the newspaper.

Icahn says Trump better for U.S. economy than Clinton,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn continued to throw his support behind the Republican U.S. presidential candidate on Tuesday, saying Donald Trump would reduce the regulation of U.S. companies. Icahn also said that nutrition and weight management company Herbalife would be a strong candidate to go private, saying such a move would allow it to avoid the kind of criticism aimed at it from Pershing Square hedge fund founder William Ackman. If you look ahead three years, this economy will be a lot better if Trump gets elected rather than Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, Icahn said, speaking at the CNBC Delivering Alpha event in New York. Trump has said that Icahn would be a great U.S. Treasury secretary though whether the 80-year-old hedge fund manager would commit to such a role remains unclear. Icahn expressed his frustration at U.S. regulators on Tuesday, specifically the Environmental Protection Agency which he says has neglected to speak to him about his concerns regarding ethanol blending requirements for the fuel refineries in his investment portfolio. Icahn said that fear of irrational government regulations are a main reason why chief executives are not re-investing in their businesses and instead buying back stock. Trump would aim to reduce such regulations, Icahn said.  Icahn also addressed his ongoing feud with Ackman, who in 2012 claimed Herbalife was running a pyramid scheme, and made a huge wager against the stock. Icahn emerged later as a buyer of the shares. Herbalife settled a probe of its sales practices with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in July. Icahn has continued buying shares, and the feud with Ackman has continued.  I think that Herbalife is certainly a candidate to go private. In fact, frankly, wearing my shareholder hat, I think Herbalife is a lot better private and getting away from this Ackman-type criticism, Icahn said at the CNBC event. Ackman is out there driving everybody crazy, which is his right to do. Hes obsessed with this. An Ackman spokesman did not immediately return an email seeking comment.

Obama on Tuesday strongly criticized Trump for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin and for appearing on a TV channel, RT, funded by the Russian government. Unfortunately, we see continued displays of often hard-core Russophobia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, commenting on Obamas intervention, told a conference call with reporters.

Obama paints Trump as no friend of the working class,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - With Hillary Clinton sidelined by pneumonia, President Barack Obama took up the Democrats fight against Donald Trump on Tuesday, trying to quash the Republican presidential candidates bid to appeal to working-class voters. Obama, whose 50 percent job approval rating could help improve the climate for the Democratic ticket in the Nov. 8 election, rallied party faithful against Trump, the 70-year-old New York real estate developer, at an outdoor event in Philadelphia. This is a guy who spent 70 years on this earth showing no concern for working people. He spent most of his life trying to stay far away from working people. He wasnt going to let you on his golf course, Obama said. Obamas campaign appearance was his first as a solo act on behalf of Clinton as he tries to ensure Democrats retain control of the White House once his eight years are over in January. The president lauded new census numbers on income growth as proof that his administrations policies have helped improve the economy, an attempt to undermine Trumps argument that economic woes are deep. By so many measures, America is stronger and more prosperous than when we started out on this journey together, Obama said. Clinton, who was Obamas secretary of state during his first term, rested at her home in the New York City suburb of Chappaqua, as she recovers from pneumonia. She was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday but she kept it secret until she nearly collapsed on Sunday at a ceremony in Manhattan marking the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. She is to return to the campaign trail on Thursday, her spokesman Nick Merrill said Tuesday evening. Her campaign said in a statement that she will deliver remarks in Greensboro, North Carolina, on Thursday and discuss her vision for an America that is stronger together. Trump appeared at a campaign event in suburban Philadelphia after Obama departed, touting proposals that would allow families to deduct child-care expenses from their income taxes and establish paid maternity leave for women whose employers do not offer it. The plan, he said, was aimed to bolster working-class and middle-class families.  With his daughter Ivanka at his side, Trump also appeared to support equal pay for women, traditionally a core issue for Democrats.   We need working mothers to be fairly compensated for their work and have access to affordable quality child care for their work, Trump said.  As he did earlier in the day at a rally in Des Moines, Trump steered clear of mentioning Clintons illness but stepped up efforts to wring maximum advantage from her controversial comment that his supporters are deplorables.  While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country, said Trump, who has tried to portray the former first lady as out of touch with ordinary Americans. Clinton said in a speech last week that half of Trumps supporters belong in a basket of deplorables and accused them of being racist and homophobic. She later said she regretted the remark. Trump, who has often bragged about his wealth, has come under fire himself for rhetoric against minorities during his campaign, including describing Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists, suggesting that a judge could not be fair because of his Mexican-American heritage, and proposing a temporary ban on Muslim immigration to the United States. After struggling in opinion polls in August, Trump has erased most of Clintons lead in national surveys and is competitive again in many battleground states where the White House race is likely to be decided.     The deplorables comment featured at a Trump rally in Asheville, North Carolina, on Monday night that saw a resumption of some of the violence that disrupted his events earlier this year.  Never in history has a major party presidential candidate so viciously demonized the American voter, Trump told the crowd.  Five people, including a minor, were arrested at the rally and charged with crimes including second degree trespassing and fighting in public, Asheville police said.  A man grabbed an anti-Trump protesters neck and punched him during the rally, video from NBC and ABC showed. Police said they also obtained an arrest warrant for the suspect in that incident.

Briton pleads guilty to weapons charge over Trump rally incident,"(Reuters) - A British tourist who caused a security scare at a Donald Trump campaign rally in Las Vegas in June by trying to grab a gun from a police officer pleaded guilty on Tuesday to charges of illegal weapon possession and disorderly conduct, court papers showed. Michael Steven Sandford, 20, admitted as part of his plea deal with prosecutors that he had approached a policeman at the event, saying he wanted an autograph from the presidential candidate, then tried to pull the officers gun from his holster with both hands, the papers said. Sandford, who had by then overstayed his tourist visa by about 10 months, was immediately arrested and removed from the rally. He also acknowledged having visited a Las Vegas gun range the day before the June 18 incident at the Treasure Island casino-hotel, to take shooting lessons with a rented Glock handgun, firing 20 rounds at a paper target, court papers showed. No mention was made in the plea agreement about whether Sandford intended to harm Trump, then the presumptive Republican nominee in the U.S. presidential race.  In the initial June 20 criminal complaint stemming from the incident, prosecutors said Sandford had told a U.S. Secret Service agent he had driven to Las Vegas from California with the aim of shooting Trump. On June 29, Sandford was charged with felony counts of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and disrupting government business, but he was not accused of plotting to kill Trump.  At Tuesdays hearing in federal court in Las Vegas, Sandford pleaded guilty to those two charges, each of which carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, the U.S. Attorneys Office said in a statement. Sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 13. Brenda Weksler, one of Sandfords federal public defenders, declined to comment. ",politicsNews,"September 14, 2016 ",1

Tennessee lawmaker ousted after sex harassment allegations: media,"NASHVILLE (Reuters) - A Tennessee lawmaker was expelled from the states House of Representatives on Tuesday following accusations of widespread sexual harassment, media reported.  Republican state Representative Jeremy Durham was ousted by a vote of 70-2, according to the Tennessean newspaper, which said this was the states first legislative expulsion since 1980.  Durham did not immediately respond to request for comment. The Tennessean reported that Durham said no formal complaint had been filed against him and that he has not been charged with a crime.  Im very pleased that the House made the decision it did today. This was good for the taxpayers of the state. It was good for the victims of the state, the newspaper quoted House Speaker Beth Harwell as saying.   A spokeswoman for Harwells office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  A report released by Tennessees attorney general in July accused Durham of inappropriate sexual conduct with 22 women over a four-year period. The report said Durham repeatedly made unwelcome sexual advances toward female legislative staff, interns and lobbyists. Durham declined to be interviewed by investigators, the report said. His lawyer, Bill Harbison, said at the time that the report was politically motivated and unfair. Harbison could not be immediately reached for comment on Tuesday.  The chairman of Tennessees Republican Party, Ryan Haynes, said on Tuesday: I am saddened that all of my former colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, have been placed in this terrible position by the reprehensible misbehavior of one individual.

California governor vetoes bill to repeal tampon tax,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown on Tuesday vetoed a bill to end state sales taxes on feminine hygiene products, angering women and advocates who call the taxes unjust. Brown, a Democrat, cited imperatives of fiscal restraint and viable revenue streams in blocking the bipartisan bill, which would have added tampons, sanitary napkins and other menstrual products to a list of necessities such as food and prescription medicines that are exempt from sales tax. Brown also vetoed several similar bills that would have ended certain state taxes for diapers and other items. He said those measures, together with repeal of the tax on feminine hygiene products, would collectively reduce state revenue by $300 million through the coming year. Each of these bills creates a new tax break or expands an existing tax break, Brown said in a statement. As I said last year, tax breaks are the same as new spending  they both cost the general fund money. State Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia, chief sponsor of the tampon tax relief bill that passed both houses of the state legislature with unanimous support, railed against the veto in a posting on Facebook. Jerry Brown please #mansplain why its OK to balance the budget on womens backs? she wrote, including a slang portmanteau of man and explain that is used to disparage men who talk to women in a manner regarded as condescending or patronizing. Lawmakers in at least 15 states have introduced measures to abolish their sales taxes on menstrual products. New York repealed its tampon tax in June, joining Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and New Jersey. The movement appeals to Republicans because it would repeal a tax and is favored by Democrats, who say it eliminates an unfair burden on women, especially those living in poverty. Garcia, the California assemblywoman, said she would press on in seeking repeal, vowing to keep pushing until we get it done. But it was not immediately clear whether a veto override bid was an option. Overriding a veto in California requires a two-thirds vote in both the state Senate and Assembly, and the legislative session ended Aug. 31.  ",politicsNews,"September 13, 2016 ",1
Lawmakers aim to delay U.S. ceding control of Internet's management,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Critics of a plan for the U.S. government to cede control of the Internets technical management to other countries might succeed in delaying such a move in Congress, a senior lawmaker said on Tuesday. Senator John Thune, a senior Republican from South Dakota, told reporters lawmakers are trying to work out ... what would be effective in terms of slowing this. The U.S. Commerce Department oversees the Internets management largely because it was invented in the United States. Some Republican politicians, including Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, want to block the handover to global stakeholders, such as businesses, tech experts and public interest advocates. Opponents of the transition said it could stifle online freedom by giving voting rights to authoritarian governments. Tech companies, technical experts and academics have said the transition is overdue and necessary to keep the Internet open and globally oriented, and that the proposal includes safeguards against any potential abuse by any one country. The plan to transfer oversight of the nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, is set to occur on Oct. 1, unless Congress votes to block the handover. The California-based corporation operates the database for domain names such as .com and .net and their corresponding numeric addresses that allow computers to connect.   The Obama administration approved the transition plan in June. Thune said he would expect language delaying the change to be in a bill to fund the government starting Oct. 1. He expects congressional leaders to finish writing the bill next week. Both houses of the Republican-controlled Congress would then have to vote on the bill and President Barack Obama, a Democrat, would have to sign it for it to become law. A leading Senate Democrat, however, scoffed at the proposed Internet provision. Can Ted Cruz and Republicans dream up any more obscure,irrelevant issues to stop the business of the American government? asked Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat. There are other outstanding government funding issues also being negotiated by lawmakers, including how much spending should be committed to fighting the Zika virus.

Loss of 'March Madness' games could hurt North Carolina governor's re-election bid,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory has weathered negative headlines as jobs, conventions and musical performances were canceled in his state this year to protest a law deemed discriminatory against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. But news that the Southern state was being stripped of hosting two rounds of the nationally popular March Madness Division I mens college basketball tournament next spring could prove the laws most damaging fallout yet for the Republican seeking re-election in November, political experts said on Tuesday. Theres one thing you dont do in North Carolina. That is mess with basketball, particularly college basketball, said  Michael Bitzer, a political scientist at Catawba College in Salisbury. In addition to the tournament, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) announced on Monday it would relocate six other championship sporting events from North Carolina for the 2016-17 season. NCAA President Mark Emmert said the move was a proverbial no-brainer after North Carolina in March became the only U.S. state to require transgender people to use bathrooms in government buildings and public schools that correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificate. The Republican-backed law, known as House Bill 2 or H.B. 2, also blocked local government measures aimed at protecting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people from discrimination. McCrory signed the measure into law and has continued to defend it as he campaigns for a second four-year term. Several recent opinion polls show him trailing his Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Roy Cooper, who has criticized the incumbent for backing the law despite mounting economic losses. In July, the National Basketball Association yanked its 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte over objections to H.B. 2. The NCAAs decision will not help McCrorys re-election chances, said Steven Greene, a political science professor at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, the state capital. Hes going to suffer from this the most, Greene said in a phone interview, explaining that most of the Republican state legislators associated with the law represent districts drawn so that Republicans have a good chance of winning elections. Responding on Tuesday to the NCAAs move, McCrory called for a halt to economic threats or political retaliation while nearly two dozen states challenge an Obama administration policy that calls for public schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice. The issue of redefining gender and basic norms of privacy will be resolved in the near future in the United States court system for not only North Carolina, but the entire nation, the governor said in a statement. Around North Carolina, residents and local officials bemoaned the loss of championship events. Polls have shown most voters think the law is hurting the state, which has hosted more Division I mens basketball tournament games than any other. Thats part of North Carolinas heart right there, said Cindy Clodfelter, 62, a retired school counselor in Winston-Salem. Anything that messes with my sports, I dont like it. The mayor of Cary - a town which was to host championship events in womens soccer, mens and womens tennis, womens lacrosse and baseball, but lost all of them to this weeks NCAA decision - said it was time for state lawmakers to re-evaluate the law. McCrory seems to be doubling down, said Mayor Harold Weinbrecht Jr. It will say a lot about our state if he wins or if he loses. ",politicsNews,"September 13, 2016 ",1
House panel okays Dodd-Frank revamp amid partisan rancor,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A House of Representatives panel on Tuesday approved a proposal to revamp the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, after a hearing where lawmakers verbally tussled over rules enacted in the aftermath of the 2007-09 financial crisis. The Financial Services Committee voted to send the bill, introduced this summer by committee chairman, Republican Jeb Hensarling, to the full House to consider. No Democrat on the committee voted for the measure, which would allow banks to choose between complying with Dodd-Frank or meeting tougher capital requirements. It would also reorganize the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a watchdog created through Dodd-Frank that last week penalized Wells Fargo for creating millions of fake accounts under customers names. The 2010 Dodd-Frank law, passed in the wake of the financial crisis, has drawn the ire of most banks and Republicans in Congress. They have said Congress went too far in trying to clamp down on Wall Street and the law imposes burdensome requirements and gives regulators too much power. The CPFB has been a particular target for Republicans, who do not like that it is governed by a single director and say it reaches beyond its authority in enforcement. During the hearing, Democrats cited the Wells case, where the CFPB levied its largest-ever fine of $100 million, criticizing the panels Republican majority. Democrats said that without Dodd-Frank the U.S. government would have had no tools to fight the widespread fraud, which led to the firing of 5,300 Wells employees. I am particularly disturbed that this bill would take away the Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus ability to penalize companies for practices that are abusive to consumers, said New Yorks Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat, echoing many in her party. The chairmans bill, strips...from the CFPB its authority to punish abusive conduct, which means Wells Fargo would have gotten off even easier. Meanwhile, Randy Neugebauer, the Texas Republican who has advocated creating a five-member commission to govern the CFPB, said the bureau has not been politically neutral and is not transparent. I remain concerned that many bureau actions demonstrate regulatory paternalism that assumes the American consumer doesnt know how to make choices for themselves, he said at the hearing. Corresponding legislation has not been introduced in the Senate, and Obama would be unlikely to sign the bill even both chambers of the Republican-led Congress passed it. Dodd-Frank is one of the Democratic presidents signature pieces of legislation. ",politicsNews,"September 13, 2016 ",1
LinkedIn's Hoffman: Trump presidency would be 'terrifying' for policy,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said on Tuesday that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump would have a terrifying effect on domestic and foreign policy if elected. The comments came one day after Hoffman published an article on Medium.com pledging support to a CrowdPac crowdfunding campaign that promises to donate to veterans causes if Trump releases his tax returns.  Hoffman said in his article that he will match five times the crowdfunded amount to donate up to $5 million. The campaign has raised more than $90,000. Hoffman told a crowd at TechCrunch Disrupt 2016 in San Francisco that he was in denial about the possibility of a Trump presidency but encouraged by efforts to hold the candidate accountable. Trumps campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Trump is facing criticism for not releasing tax returns, a political practice that is not required by law but has been done by every White House nominee since 1973. His campaign last week released 10 years of returns for vice presidential nominee Mike Pence and repeated a pledge that Trump would release his own returns once the government completes an audit. When I saw the campaign  I said thats exactly the right way to make this message, a message in support of folks who have given great service to our country. If Donald Trump is as concerned with making America great as he says he is he should care about veterans, Hoffman said.  ",politicsNews,"September 13, 2016 ",1
Trump presidency could cost U.S. economy $1 trillion: Oxford Economics,"LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy could be $1 trillion smaller than otherwise expected in 2021 if Republican candidate Donald Trump wins the presidential election in November, economics research firm Oxford Economics said on Tuesday. While the firm said Trumps policies - including more protectionist trade measures, tax cuts and mass deportation of illegal immigrants - may be watered down in negotiations with Congress, they could have adverse consequences.  Should Mr. Trump prove more successful in achieving adoption of his policies, the consequences could be far-reaching  knocking 5 percent off the level of U.S. GDP relative to baseline and undermining the anticipated recovery in global growth, it said. Oxford Economics describes itself as an independent global advisory firm. It is headquartered in Oxford, England, but has offices around the world, including in Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Washington. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the research. At a campaign event in Clive, Iowa, on Tuesday, however, Trump reasserted that he would grow the U.S. economy.  He vowed to revive the countrys manufacturing sector by preventing U.S. companies such as Apple Inc from making products overseas, renegotiating global trade accords and slashing federal taxes and regulations. Were going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans, Trump said. Under its baseline scenario, Oxford Economics expects U.S.  gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced in the economy, to grow at a fairly constant rate of around 2 percent from 2017, reaching $18.5 trillion in 2021. But if Trump is elected and succeeds in implementing his policies, it predicts growth would slow significantly, falling near zero in 2019, and reducing overall GDP to $17.5 trillion.  Oxford Economics said its baseline scenario assumes Trumps Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton triumphs in the Nov. 8 vote and a split Congress emerges - between a Republican U.S. House of Representatives and a Democratic U.S. Senate - which results largely in a continuation of current policies. Trump would face challenges winning the backing of Congress for all his policies, and some economists argue that looser tax policy could actually help boost economic growth. The latest opinion polls show Clinton, the former secretary of state, ahead, but her lead has slipped in recent weeks. ",politicsNews,"September 13, 2016 ",1
Democrats expect Senate will oppose Obama on Saudi 9/11 bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic leaders of the U.S. Senate said on Tuesday they expected the chamber would vote to override President Barack Obamas promised veto of a bill allowing relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia. It would be the first override of an Obama veto since he took office in January 2009. The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, known as JASTA, would remove sovereign immunity, preventing lawsuits against governments, for countries found to be involved in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. Fifteen of the Sept. 11 hijackers who crashed airliners in the 2001 attacks were Saudi nationals. The Saudi government, which strongly denies responsibility, has lobbied against the bill. But some members of Congress have become increasingly restive about relations with Saudi Arabia, long an important player in U.S. Middle East policy. Harry Reid, the Senates Democratic leader, said he supported the measure. Theyre not one of my favorite countries, he said of the Saudis. Richard Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said, Were all on the record supporting it, so at this point I think its a heavy lift for the president to have his veto sustained. A White House spokesman said in a briefing on Tuesday it had received the bill, but did not offer updates about timing of a veto. The Constitution gives the president 10 days after receiving a bill to veto it before it automatically becomes law. ",politicsNews,"September 13, 2016 ",1
Obama would veto House bill to block funding of Guantanamo transfers: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obamas advisers would recommend he veto a bill in the House of Representatives that prohibits use of funds to transfer individuals detained at the Guantanamo Bay military prison to the United States or any foreign country, the White House said on Tuesday.  The bill was introduced in the House and is making its way through Congress. It faces a tough battle in the Senate.

Spy agencies concerned about possible U.S. election hacks: NSA chief,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American intelligence agencies are concerned about reports that foreign governments may be attempting to undermine the Nov. 8  U.S. elections through cyber attacks, Admiral Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, said on Tuesday. We continue to be actively concerned, Rogers told a Senate hearing, responding to a question from Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Marcel Lettre, Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, testified that the government is taking any such activities quite seriously and said an aggressive investigation is under way. McCain noted that one of the two states in which media reports said there was evidence of attempted Russian hacking was his home state, Arizona. Some analysts have said Arizona, which recently has been reliably Republican in presidential elections, could be tilting more toward the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, this year. McCain, a Republican, himself is in a tougher than usual re-election fight. Rogers said he could not provide specifics about spy agencies current assessment of the alleged hacking in a public setting. But he added, I will say this, that it continues to be an issue of great focus ... for the foreign intelligence community, attempting to generate insights into what foreign nations are doing in this area. Under further questioning, Rogers declined to characterize the activity as by a foreign nation-state. Lettre said the government would adopt a policy for dealing with any such activity once it had the results of the investigation. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security has an aggressive investigation underway, Lettre said. U.S. security officials have said that, starting last year, hackers infiltrated computers of the Democratic National Committee, Clintons presidential campaign and her partys congressional fundraising committee. U.S. officials said they have concluded that Russia or its proxies were responsible, leading to calls by some Democrats and cyber security officials for the Obama administration to blame Russia publicly. Kremlin officials have dismissed the allegations as absurd, but there is anxiety in Washington over the possibility that a foreign power might be using hacked information to meddle in the November elections.

Hillary Clinton's overdrive aimed at breaking women's glass ceiling,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It was classic Hillary Clinton, ignoring medical advice and attending a ceremony on a sultry New York City day while battling pneumonia - a decision ex-aides and other associates speculated was rooted in her longstanding desire to prove that women can compete in the male-dominated world of politics. The move backfired on the famously stoic Democratic presidential candidate after she had to leave Sundays September. 11 remembrance early and was caught on camera buckling from dehydration as she was helped into a van.  Clinton, 68, has since acknowledged she went too far in trying to soldier on with a jam-packed schedule. Daniel Scherb, a South Bend, Indiana, cardiologist interviewed by Reuters, who was not privy to Clintons medical records, said pneumonia can leave a patient feeling blah for seven to 10 days under the best of circumstances and, at worst, people can die from it. Former subordinates who are fiercely loyal to Clinton said there are plenty of instances in which she drove herself remarkably hard as first lady from 1993-2001, as a U.S. senator from 2001-2009 and as U.S. secretary of state from 2009-2013. In her first year at the State Department in 2009, she traveled abroad extensively shortly after undergoing surgery for a broken arm. One retired ambassador said Clinton sees herself as part of a generation of women who had to work extra hard to overcome barriers to female advancement. The ambassador describes this as part of an ethos that you could never be weaker than a man. At the same time, the ambassador blamed Clintons aides in part for allowing her to put herself into difficult situations. At an event in Congo after breaking her arm, Clinton snapped at someone who posed a question she disliked, the ambassador recalled. While the question may have been translated into English incorrectly, the ambassador said Clinton also was clearly exhausted. Its not necessarily that she is running roughshod over the advice of her staff. Her staff doesnt seem to take very good care of her, the ambassador said. Working to defeat Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, 70, on the rough-and-tumble campaign trail, Clinton has said she is held to a different standard. Women are seen through a different lens, Clinton told Humans of New York, a group organized around a project to photograph and catalog stories of New Yorkers. Ive learned that I cant be quite so passionate in my presentation, she said, adding, I love to wave my arms, but apparently thats a little bit scary to people.And I cant yell too much. It comes across as too loud or too shrill or too this or too that, even though those attending her rallies are loving it. In all her roles, including as President Bill Clintons healthcare chief and a two-time presidential candidate, Clinton has been known as an almost unstoppable, detail-oriented policy wonk. Her constant work, internal in meetings or external on Capitol Hill, was virtually incomprehensible, said David Dreyer, a White House deputy communications director during Bill Clintons first term. Dreyer, who said he had a front row seat to the healthcare reform fight that Hillary Clinton spearheaded as first lady, said she is wired to always be fully prepared and compelled to public service. CANT-WIN SITUATION Three other people, one close to Clinton when she was secretary of state and as a presidential candidate, said efforts to persuade her to temper her travel and appearance schedule can go nowhere because she insists it is expected of her. One, a prominent former official who has advised Clinton on foreign policy issues, said: She pushes herself so hard because shes convinced that only she can do what needs to be done, and thats compounded by a very small inner circle that in some cases doesnt like to contradict or confront her, and as a result just ends up encouraging this compulsion. Matt Bennett, who served as deputy assistant for intergovernmental affairs in Bill Clintons second presidential term, said Hillary Clinton is in a cant-win situation here. Noting competing, unsubstantiated attacks from Trump and his supporters about her health versus criticisms that she does not know how to pace herself, Either she is frail or reckless with her health. Bennett added, I dont view her as disregarding medical advice over past blood clots, a fall that caused a concussion and other maladies. But I do think shes super tough. Bennett, now a vice president at the Third Way think tank, said the increasingly frantic pace of campaigning for the White House has pressed candidates to the limit. As an aide to retired General Wesley Clark while he unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004, Bennett noted that Clark would constantly remark about the rigors of the campaign. He was shot multiple times in Vietnam and went through (elite Army) Ranger training and hes saying this is really tough running for president. ",politicsNews,"September 13, 2016 ",1
Paul Ryan's challenges will not start until after Nov. 8 election,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan is expected to cruise to re-election in his Wisconsin congressional district on Nov. 8, the day before his real political problems are likely to start. That is when Ryan will know the shape of the new House of Representatives. If, as some analysts foresee, it becomes even more conservative than it is now, Ryans difficulties in managing the lower chamber of Congress could worsen. For the highest-ranking elected U.S. Republican, that could spell trouble as the former vice presidential nominee looks ahead to a possible presidential run in 2020. Some staunch House conservatives, questioning Ryans commitment to them and their agenda, are looking less kindly on the idea of re-electing him as speaker early next year. But his real test, assuming he retains the speakers gavel, would be getting legislative results with a more conservative House. Compounding that could be the U.S. Senate switching to Democratic from Republican control and possibly a Democratic president, Hillary Clinton, if she beats Republican Donald Trump in the November election. Next year, almost no matter what, is going to be a very tough one for Paul Ryan, said political scientist Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute think tank. The 2016 election results could cast a shadow over Ryans presidential ambitions in 2020 and 2024, assuming he harbors them. It may well be that he decides its just not worth it, partly given what he sees within his own party, Ornstein said. Ryans aides were reluctant on Monday to discuss the possible challenges of the next Congress. The focus over the next 57 days is defending and strengthening our House majority. We are in a good position,  said Ryans political spokesman, Zack Roday. Republicans hold 246 of the 435 House seats, their biggest majority in decades. But analysts expect the party will lose seats in November, especially if Trump hurts fellow Republicans. House members serve two-year terms and most are easily re-elected. The political prediction newsletter Sabatos Crystal Ball has tagged only 16 races as too close to call. Ten of those are currently held by moderates or pragmatists who have been fairly reliable supporters of legislation backed by Republican leaders including Ryan. Five of the 10 are retiring from the House. If Trumps performance damages candidates down the ticket, moderates may bear the brunt. The result could be a smaller House Republican majority more dominated by politically secure conservatives of the sort who have in recent years defied Ryan on some legislation. A shrinking GOP conference is no doubt going to be more conservative in the new Congress, raising the challenge for Speaker Ryan to form majorities with a slimmer and more conservative rank and file, said Sarah Binder, professor of political science at George Washington University. If a number of moderates lose their seats, while most conservatives hold theirs, then the House Freedom Caucus becomes more powerful, said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabatos Crystal Ball. The Freedom Caucus is the Houses most conservative bloc, with about 40 members. It helped eject Ryans predecessor, John Boehner, a year ago, leading to Ryans election as speaker. The Freedom Caucus initially welcomed Ryan, a budget and fiscal policy specialist seen as more willing to listen to their agenda. But some Freedom Caucus members are unhappy with him since one of their members, Representative Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, lost a primary election last month. Ryan could have done more to help Huelskamp, some critics said. There was huge disappointment in that, said Representative John Fleming, a Freedom Caucus member from Louisiana who is running for the U.S. Senate in November. The Huelskamp fallout has driven speculation that some conservatives who previously backed Ryan will oppose him when the House elects a new speaker in January, although none of them has said so publicly. I dont think most members feel yet that Ryan is undeserving of more time (as speaker), but frustration with the leadership is certainly growing, said Dan Holler of Heritage Action, the political wing of the Heritage Foundation conservative think tank.

"McCain vows to block proposed separation of NSA, cyber command","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain said on Tuesday he would use his power to block the confirmation of a key cybersecurity official if necessary to prevent any Obama administration move to separate the U.S. Cyber Command from the National Security Agency. I do not believe rushing to separate the dual hat in the final months of an administration is appropriate, given the very serious challenges we face in cyberspace, McCain, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said at a hearing. Dual hat refers to one individual holding both positions. Current and former U.S. officials told Reuters in August that President Barack Obamas administration was preparing to elevate the stature of the Department of Defenses Cyber Command, including separating it from the NSA.  Officials argued that the focus of the NSA, a spy agency responsible for electronic eavesdropping, is gathering intelligence, often favoring the monitoring of an enemys cyber activities.  Cyber Commands mission is geared more to shutting down cyber attacks - and, if ordered, counter attacking. McCain said the two agencies must work closely together to protect U.S. national security and he would block any nominee if that person was not nominated both to run the NSA and lead Cyber Command. He also said he wanted the administration to provide his panel with detailed plans of its proposed reorganization. This committee does not take well to being stonewalled while their colleagues in the administration leak information to the press, McCain said. Admiral Mike Rogers, the current NSA director and head of Cyber Command, told the hearing that he did not think it was in the best U.S. national security interest at this point to separate the two functions.

"In Pennsylvania, Trump to propose childcare deduction tax break","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Tuesday will propose allowing families to deduct the cost of childcare expenses from income taxes, his campaign said, a move aimed at bolstering his support among women voters. Trump is to lay out the plan in an evening speech in the Philadelphia suburb of Aston, Pennsylvania, his latest attempt to construct a policy framework that he would use for governing if elected over Democrat Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8. Trump is to be introduced at the event by his daughter, Ivanka, who has championed the issue of childcare as an influential voice in his campaign. She told reporters on a conference call that she was involved in developing the plan. Im very passionate about this, she said. Trumps support among women voters has lagged. Overall, he has risen to a more competitive position against Clinton in national opinion polls and in battleground states where the election is likely to be decided. Polls show the race tightening in the crucial state of Pennsylvania. A Quinnipiac University poll last week said Clinton led 48 percent to 43 percent for Trump there, a reduction from her 10-point lead a month ago. Trumps plan would change the U.S. tax code to let parents deduct from their income taxes childcare expenses for up to four children and elderly dependents, his campaign said. It would be available for individuals earning less than $250,000 a year or under $500,000 for couples filing jointly. Trump campaign officials did not detail the overall cost of the program. A senior official said it would be part of Trumps plan to overhaul the tax code and would end up not adding to deficit spending in the U.S. budget. Trump would offer childcare spending rebates to lower-income taxpayers through the existing Earned Income Tax Credit. The campaign said this could mean tax rebates as high as $1,200 for eligible families each year. Trump also would create new Dependent Care Savings Accounts to allow families to set aside money to foster their childrens development and offset elder care for their parents or adult dependents, the campaign said. Individuals could contribute up to $2,000 a year tax free. The New York businessman also is proposing guaranteed six weeks of paid maternity leave. He would accomplish this by amending the existing unemployment insurance that companies are required to carry.  The benefit would apply only when employers do not offer paid maternity leave, and would be paid for by offsetting reductions in the federal unemployment insurance program so that taxes are not raised.

"How to get sick on the U.S. campaign trail: Little sleep, bad food, germs everywhere","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clintons bout of pneumonia has shed light on a problem seldom seen by American voters: The long days, little sleep, cross-country travel, bad food and kissing babies add up to a recipe for illness for presidential candidates and aides. Avoiding viruses and other ailments can be next to impossible for people who spend months in the close confines of campaign planes and buses. Brooke Buchanan, former press secretary to 2008 Republican presidential candidate Senator John McCain, remembers leaving the campaign trail in Beaufort, South Carolina to visit an emergency room. She had a respiratory ailment and two ear infections. You have to soldier on during certain things, but theres a point when you become a liability, Buchanan said. I was back on the road the next day, full of antibiotics. Supporters of Clinton, who will face Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election, worried on Monday that the Democratic presidential nominees medical scare would fuel conspiracy theories about her health. But Republican and Democratic political veterans alike say illnesses are an unwelcome but standard part of life on the campaign trail. Alice Stewart, who was a senior adviser to former presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz during the Republican primary earlier this year, remembers coughing her way through some of his news conferences while she was recording them for the campaign. She called the Cruz plane a flying petri dish. You just kind of power through it. When youre on the road, you cant drive home, Stewart said. In recent weeks, several staff at Clintons campaigns Brooklyn headquarters have fallen ill and required medical treatment, a campaign aide said. Steven Simpson, a pulmonary specialist at the University of Kansas, said candidates were particularly vulnerable to illness. The average patient, if you have the luxury of it, takes the week off before you go back to your full duties, Simpson said. But how do you say that to a presidential candidate? President Barack Obama caught a cold in August 2008, shortly before the Democratic Partys convention. A video posted on YouTube shows him sneezing at a rally. Thats why Ive got my handkerchief, he said. Every candidate and campaign aide gets sick, but they just never get to take days off, said former Obama aide Dan Pfeiffer. You take vitamin C and try to get sleep, but its a losing battle. Obamas 2008 opponent, John McCain, traveled at times with a friend who was a doctor, said Steve Schmidt, the Republican candidates campaign manager. I think one of the secrets of working in a White House or on a presidential campaign is its the closest you can ever get to traveling with Elvis (Presley) when it comes to the number of pills that are floating around, Schmidt said. There was always a big bag of every conceivable type of antibiotic and cold medicine, and you name it - we had it. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney developed a respiratory illness days before delivering his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa in 2012. I was scared to death that he wouldnt really be able to speak, said Stuart Stevens, who was Romneys senior adviser. Doctors tell you to rest. But theres no time for that. The grueling schedule led Stevens himself to develop pneumonia right after the 2012 campaign ended. Unhealthy food is another hazard of the campaign trail. Junk food is ubiquitous on campaign planes, and candidates flock to gatherings such as the Iowa State Fair that serve up fried candy bars, sausages and other high-calorie fare. Romney, who also ran for president in 2008, would sometimes pick the cheese off his pizza and the skin off fried chicken to limit the fat content, said former spokesman Ryan Williams. Its not healthy food, its campaign food, said Williams. And most operatives see themselves put on 10 or 20 pounds by the end of the campaign. Trump is a noted germophobe, and there has been little evidence of him having gotten ill. He is a proud consumer of fast food, once tweeting a photo of himself on his plane with a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken nearby. That was also the chicken of choice for 1996 Republican nominee Bob Dole, who managed to avoid getting sick throughout his campaign, said his then-traveling press secretary, Nelson Warfield. Much of the campaign staff that was half his age were hobbled at some point or another during the campaign, but Dole was resilient, he said. Still, Dole had one nasty stumble. He fell off a stage in Chico, California, at campaign rally on Oct. 18, 1996. He got up smiling and soldiered on. ",politicsNews,"September 12, 2016 ",1
U.S. tech firms urge Congress to allow internet domain changeover,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major technology companies including Facebook, Google and Twitter are urging Congress to support a plan for the U.S. government to cede control of the internets technical management to the global community, they said in a joint letter dated on Tuesday. The U.S. Commerce Department has primary oversight of the internets management, largely because it was invented in the United States. Some Republican lawmakers are trying to block the handover to global stakeholders, which include businesses, tech experts and public interest advocates, saying it could stifle online freedom by giving voting rights to authoritarian governments. The years-long plan to transfer oversight of the nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, is scheduled to occur on Oct. 1 unless Congress votes to block the handover. The California-based corporation operates the database for domain names such as .com and .net and their corresponding numeric addresses that allow computers to connect.  In the Sept. 13 letter, a copy of which had been reviewed by Reuters before it was sent, the technology companies said it was imperative that Congress does not delay the transition. A global, interoperable and stable Internet is essential for our economic and national security, and we remain committed to completing the nearly twenty year transition to the multi stakeholder model that will best serve U.S. interests, the letter said.  Other signatories include Amazon, Cloudflare, Yahoo and several technology trade organizations. Former presidential hopeful Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who leads the opposition against the handover, will hold a congressional hearing on Wednesday to review the transition, which he has criticized as a giveaway of our internet freedom. Tech companies, technical experts and academics have said the transition is overdue and necessary to keep the Internet open and globally oriented, and that the proposal includes safeguards against any potential abuse by any one country.

Trump luxury hotel opens just blocks from the White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump opened the latest outpost in his real estate empire on Monday, a luxury hotel in a historic building five blocks from the White House that underwent a two-year, $200 million renovation. While staff members at the 263-room Trump International Hotel planned little hoopla for what they described as a soft opening, about 40 protesters opposed to the New York real estate developers presidential run gathered outside. The opening came eight weeks before the Nov. 8 election. It kind of fits his personality that he finds a way to be on Pennsylvania Avenue, one way or another, said protester Judy Byron, 70, a Washington artist. The hotel, which includes a $20,000-a-night suite, is less than a mile (km) down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. The hotel is housed in Washingtons third-tallest building, the 1899 Old Post Office, built in the Romanesque Revival architectural style. Trump said on Twitter he had stopped by the property to thank all of the tremendous men & women for their hard work! The protesters criticized some of Trumps positions, including a promise to build a wall along the Mexican border to block illegal immigrants. Protest organizer Andrew Castro of Baltimore said: Were out here building a wall against racism. Dozens of people filtered in and out on Monday afternoon, some to gawk and others pausing for a drink at the hotels bar. On his way in, Ric Hedlund, who works in port development, said he had been impressed by the renovations of a building that he said was previously a dump. Im going in to drink Trump wine, said Hedlund, who added he also supported Trump as a candidate. Trumps daughter Ivanka, who helped negotiate the 60-year lease with the U.S. government and oversaw the buildings revamp and design, said the project had come in a year ahead of schedule and under budget. We have really positioned this hotel to not only be the finest hotel in D.C. but in the country, she said in a telephone interview. A grand-opening ceremony is planned for next month. Trump attended the 2014 groundbreaking for the renovations alongside local Democratic officials before launching his presidential campaign last year. While Trumps name is hard to escape in his native New York, where it adorns structures including the Trump Tower as well as a Bronx golf course, the hotel marks his most visible presence in Washington. His comments describing some Mexican immigrants as criminals prompted celebrity chefs Jose Andres and Geoffrey Zakarian to pull out of the project. Trump has sued them.

Trump says Fed keeping rates low because of pressure from Obama,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Monday that U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen was keeping interest rates low because of political pressure from the Obama administration, questioning the motives of an institution whose work hinges on maintaining its independence. Well, its (the interest rate) staying at zero because shes obviously political and shes doing what Obama wants her to do, Trump told CNBC in a phone interview, saying Yellen should be ashamed of what she was doing to the country. The U.S. central bank has raised interest rates just once since cutting them to zero in response to the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed has indicated it is preparing for a second hike of 0.25 percentage point, although it has signaled the pace of future rate rises will be slower than in the past. Any increase at all will be a very, very small increase because they want to keep the market up so Obama goes out and let the new guy ... raise interest rates ... and watch what happens in the stock market, Trump said. He did not specify how the Democratic president had put pressure on Yellen. While Yellen has met with Obama, the Fed as an institution is independent when it comes to raising or lowering rates, and both Yellen and other rate-setters have said the Fed has no view on the Nov. 8 election. The Feds Washington-based board had no comment on Trumps remarks, though regional Federal Reserve bank presidents said during public appearances that politics do not enter into Fed deliberations. Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari responded in a later interview on CNBC by denying that politics influenced Fed policymaking. Politics simply does not come up, he said. We look at the economic data and ... everyone around the table is committed to achieving our dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices, Kashkari said.   Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart, asked about political pressure on the Fed at a National Association for Business Economics conference in Atlanta, said, I dont see the world that way. Trumps comments mark a back-and-forth by the candidate over whether he feels low rates are good or bad. He has accused the Fed of keeping rates low at Obamas behest, but at other times has said he felt lower rates were good because higher rates would make the dollar stronger, hurting American exports and manufacturers.  As a businessman, he said, I love low interest rates, but said they hurt many people who were living on their savings. Typically, Fed officials steer clear of politics in their public remarks, and argue that doing so is important for the Fed to maintain the independence it needs to set monetary policy. The moments when the line is publicly breached, such as former Chair Alan Greenspans endorsement of a Bush administration tax cut, are rare and can provoke a quick backlash.  Though the members of the Feds Board of Governors are appointed by the president with Senate confirmation, their long, 14-year terms and staggered appointment dates are designed to insulate them from the sort of pressure Trump alleges.  The chair, considered one of the most powerful positions in setting U.S. economic policy, is picked from the board members for a four-year term. Yellens would expire in 2018, and Trump has previously said he would consider replacing her. The Feds marching orders, however, come from Congress, which has set the central banks mandate. The Fed lowered interest rates to near zero in response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and has increased them only once since then - in December - given the sluggish pace of the recovery. Fed members and economists have vigorously debated the issue Trump raised - whether easy-money policies have led to an unsustainable rise in asset prices.

"'I didn't think it was a big deal,' Clinton says of pneumonia bout","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton said on Monday she could resume presidential campaigning in a couple of days after a bout of pneumonia that she initially had not believed was that big a deal. Clintons health scare after she almost collapsed at an event on Sunday, causing her to cancel some campaign trips, revived concerns about a tendency toward secrecy that has dogged her campaign, and underscored perennial worries about the medical fitness of candidates for one of the worlds most demanding jobs. Well, it will be in the next couple of days. ... I just want to get this over and done with and get back on the trail as soon as possible, she said in an interview on CNN on Monday night, adding she had ignored doctors orders to rest.  I just didnt think it was going to be that big a deal.  Her campaign acknowledged on Monday it may have been too slow disclosing her pneumonia diagnosis after she nearly fainted at a New York memorial ceremony for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. She was diagnosed with the lung infection on Friday. I think that in retrospect, we could have handled it better in terms of providing more information more quickly, Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon told MSNBC earlier in the day. The health problem was the latest blow for the Democratic presidential nominee at a time when Republican rival Donald Trump has erased most of her lead in national opinion polls and is competitive again in many battleground states where the Nov. 8 election is likely to be decided. Clinton, 68, said she had dealt with similar episodes of dizziness before. You know, it is something that has occurred a few times over the course of my life. Im aware of it and usually can avoid it, she told CNN. Asked if she passed out during the incident on Sunday, she said: No, I didnt. I felt dizzy and I did lose my balance for a minute. Once I got in. Once I could sit down. Once I could cool off. Once I had some water, I immediately started feeling better.   Her campaign said her husband, former President Bill Clinton, would campaign on her behalf while she rests. Both Clinton and Trump, 70, said they intended to release more of their medical details in the coming days, as their campaigns gear up for the November election. Questions about the incident reinforced the perception of Clinton as secretive, a view fueled by the controversy surrounding her use of a private email server while serving as President Barack Obamas secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. A federal investigation of that issue said she was extremely careless in her handling of classified emails, but did not recommend criminal charges. Trump said on Monday that health was a campaign issue but he did not attack Clinton over her physical condition. I just hope she gets well and gets back on the trail, he said in an interview with Fox News. He focused his criticism on comments by Clinton last week in which she dismissed half of his supporters as a basket of deplorables of racist, homophobic people. Clinton said she regretted the remark. Trump has compared the comment with a much-criticized remark by 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney that 47 percent of the electorate was dependent on the government. I was deeply shocked and alarmed to hear my opponent attack, slander, smear, demean these wonderful, amazing people who are supporting our campaign by the millions, Trump told a conference of National Guard members in Baltimore. Trump has himself aroused controversy with comments in which he called some Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists, questioned whether a U.S.-born judge could be fair because of his Mexican heritage and criticized the Muslim parents of an American soldier who died in combat in Iraq. SHORT-TERM TURBULENCE Clintons pneumonia disclosure was made public hours after her campaign said she had become overheated to explain why, her knees buckling and unsteady, she was rushed from the Sept. 11 ceremony. The short-term turbulence will be more about the handling of this than the substance, David Axelrod, a former political adviser to Obama, told Reuters.  Antibiotics can take care of pneumonia, Axelrod tweeted later. Whats the cure for an unhealthy penchant for privacy that repeatedly creates unnecessary problems? Trump had suggested for weeks that Clinton lacked the energy needed to be president. He has raised questions about her stamina, reprising a tactic from the Republican primary campaign when he derided rival Jeb Bush as a low-energy candidate.  Democrats said her attendance at events despite her pneumonia diagnosis proved her toughness. Trumps campaign has issued a short letter from his doctor saying he was in excellent health with extraordinary strength and stamina. But the letter did not mention what medicine Trump might be taking or other details typically included in such disclosures. In July 2015, Clinton released a two-page letter outlining her medical condition that sought to reassure Americans about her health after she fell and suffered a concussion at home in 2012 near the end of her tenure as secretary of state.

Former California lawmaker sentenced for laundering bribe to his brother,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - A former California lawmaker was sentenced to six months in prison and six months in home confinement Monday for laundering a bribe accepted by his brother, also a former legislator. Thomas Calderon, 62, pleaded guilty on June 6 to one count of money laundering in the case. He admitted to depositing $30,000 in an account held by his political consulting company, the Calderon Group, that had been offered as a bribe by an undercover agent to his brother in 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice said Monday. Tom Calderon was all too aware of the bribe payments to his brother and that his brother had agreed to a quid pro quo with the undercover agents, United States Attorney Eileen M. Decker said in a press release. Tom Calderon facilitated these bribe payments by helping to conceal his brothers corrupt activities from the public. Calderons attorney, Shepard Kopp, said the longtime political hand from the blue collar Los Angeles suburb of Montebello was deeply remorseful for his actions. If he had it to do all over again he would obviously make a different decision, Kopp said. But its important to view Tom and his life and public service as a whole rather than this one episode. Hes been trying to better the lives of the people in his community on the east side of Los Angeles for more than 30 years. He was sentenced Monday by U.S. District Court Judge Christina Snyder to a year and a day in custody - half of it in federal prison - and 100 hours of community service. Calderon, a Democrat, served in the state assembly from 1998 to 2002, representing Montebello and other suburbs northeast of Los Angeles.  His brother, Ronald Calderon, 59, also of Montebello, was a Democratic state senator in 2013, when the FBI raided his office as part of the corruption case. The brothers were indicted in the case the following year. Ron Calderon, who took a leave of absence from the state Senate until his term ended in 2014,  pleaded guilty to mail fraud in the case and is set to be sentenced next week.

Obama asks U.S. insurers for help enrolling the young and healthy,"(Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Monday urged U.S. insurers offering coverage next year under his national healthcare law to step up their efforts to enroll those who remain uninsured, especially younger and healthier Americans. Several big insurers, including UnitedHealth Group Inc, Aetna Inc and Humana Inc, have announced they will pull back from the Obamacare individual insurance market in 2017, citing financial losses due to the costs of covering members who are sicker than expected. Their planned exit has prompted new questions over whether Obamacare can survive over the long-term if insurers cannot create a viable business from the market. Insurance premiums for consumers have jumped each year since Obamacare plans took effect in 2014, and those price increases are expected to grow steeper as fewer insurers participate.  Obama, in a letter to all insurers selling health plans next year on the exchanges, noted that the program has helped reduce the percentage of Americans without health insurance to a record low, and acknowledged that it could still be improved to benefit insurers and consumers. His administration will help find and enroll those who still lack coverage, with a particular focus on enrolling young adults.  Since the remaining uninsured are disproportionately younger and healthier, signing them up improves the risk pool and consequently the affordability of coverage for all enrollees, Obama said in the letter. Obama, Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell and other top health advisers on Monday met with executives from several leading insurance companies, including Cigna Corp Chief Executive David Cordani and Humana CEO Bruce Broussard, to discuss ways to strengthen the marketplace ahead of its fourth open enrollment period, which begins Nov. 1, according to a White House official.         A spokeswoman for industry group Americas Health Insurance Plans said the meetings focus included increasing enrollment.  As health plans are preparing for open enrollment, todays meeting was focused on how to build on the continued progress in reducing the uninsured rate and moving forward with policy solutions that will support a stable, affordable market for 2017 and beyond, AHIP spokeswoman Clare Krusing said.

"Obama hopeful on spending, Zika funds after meeting Congress leaders","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said after meeting with the top four congressional leaders on Monday he was encouraged that lawmakers would be able to pass short term spending legislation to keep the government open during the 2017 fiscal year.  Democrat Obama said he was hopeful about reaching agreements with the Republican-majority Congress on funding to fight the Zika virus and for disaster relief after flooding in Louisiana. The president met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan, both Republicans, and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi on issues that have been a struggle as his second term winds down. My hope is that by the time Congress adjourns before the election that we will have an agreement in place to fund the government and that our Zika funding will be taken care of, Obama told reporters in the Oval Office. Obama will leave office on Jan. 20.  Obama said he hoped Congress can make modest progress before the Nov. 8 elections and he was even more hopeful we can get some things done, after them. Congress must pass a temporary spending bill by Sept. 30 or much of the federal government will shut down. Shortly before the meeting with Obama, McConnell said congressional leaders were making progress on legislation on temporary spending and Zika. McConnell said he expected to advance the legislation in the Senate this week. Congressional leaders are considering attaching as much as $1.1 billion in Zika spending to the temporary spending bill. In February, Obama had asked Congress to approve $1.9 billion in emergency funds to fight Zika with diagnostic tools and vaccines, but disagreements over side issues related to abortion have led to divisions about full funding. Ryan spoke at the meeting about his desire to come to a speedy resolution on short term spending legislation that includes funding for Zika, an aide to the speaker said. Ryan also made clear his objections to doing a massive spending bill later in the year, the aide said. ",politicsNews,"September 12, 2016 ",1
Former CIA chief who urged Iraq war signs on as Trump adviser,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former CIA Director James Woolsey, a vocal advocate of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq who promoted allegations that Saddam Hussein harbored illegal weapons, will serve as a senior national security adviser to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, the campaign announced on Monday. Woolseys hiring contrasted with Trumps repeated assertions that he was a stalwart opponent of the invasion, although he initially supported it. In the announcement, Woolsey said he supports Trumps plan to expand the U.S. military, which calls for ending Pentagon budget caps and spending billions of dollars for additional troops, ships and aircraft. Mr. Trumps commitment to reversing the harmful defense budget cuts signed into law by the current administration, while acknowledging the need for debt reduction, is an essential step toward reinstating the United States primacy in the conventional and digital battlespace, Woolsey said. Woolsey, who served for two years as CIA chief under then-President Bill Clinton, also criticized the presence of classified information in emails stored on Democratic candidate Hillary Clintons private server. In an appearance on CNN, however, he called Trumps plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States a bad decision. He also has warned about the threats posed by climate change, something Trump has called a hoax that benefits China. Woolsey was an outspoken proponent of the Iraq invasion, suggesting that Saddam was hiding nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs from U.N. inspectors. He also promoted the erroneous allegation that the Iraqi dictator backed al Qaidas Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. Shortly after former President George W. Bush took office in 2001, Woolsey visited Britain on a Defense Department trip in a fruitless hunt for evidence that Saddam masterminded the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center in New York. He made a second visit to Britain for the same purpose shortly after Sept. 11, and again came up empty. At the time of his second trip, Woolsey was a member of the Defense Policy Board, a panel of outside advisers to the Defense Department that advocated Saddams overthrow even in the absence of any evidence of his complicity in 9/11. The following year, he arranged for the Defense Intelligence Agency to debrief an Iraqi defector who claimed that Iraq had mobile biological-warfare laboratories disguised as yogurt and milk trucks. The man was later determined to be a fabricator. In 2000, Woolsey briefly served as a corporate officer of a foundation that managed U.S. funding for the Iraqi National Congress, the exile group that produced a series of defectors who peddled false information to bolster the allegations that Saddam was hiding illicit weapons programs. No such weapons or facilities have ever been found. ",politicsNews,"September 12, 2016 ",1
Four U.S. lawmakers urge safety agency to address vehicle hacking,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four Republican members of Congress on Monday urged U.S. auto safety regulators to convene an industry-wide effort to prevent possible attacks on computer systems in vehicles. The lawmakers addressed their concerns in a letter to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. While there have been no reported cases of vehicle hacking, researchers have shown they could take remote control of vehicle functions such as car horns, brakes and power steering. The letter cited work published in August by Wired magazine by two researchers who were able to force a Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV 2014 Jeep SUV to perform in an erratic and unsafe manner after accessing its on-board diagnostics (OBD) port. Automakers have been required to install the port in all vehicles since 1994 to test for emissions compliance. The letter from Representative Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and three others said the port as it currently exists creates a growing risk to the safety and security of passengers. Fiat Chrysler said in August the demonstration published by Wired required a computer to be physically connected into the vehicles port. The company emphasized that owners should not connect any unknown or untrusted devices to the OBD port. NHTSA didnt immediately comment on the letter. The safety agency has said it plans to release cybersecurity guidelines to the auto industry in the coming weeks. The U.S. government is taking the issue seriously. On Friday, the U.S. Justice Department said it has formed a threat analysis team to study potential national security challenges posed by self-driving cars, medical devices and other internet-connected tools. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and NHTSA issued a bulletin in March warning that motor vehicles were increasingly vulnerable to hacking. ",politicsNews,"September 12, 2016 ",1

Factbox: Why the Zika virus is causing alarm,"Global health officials are racing to better understand the Zika virus behind a major outbreak that began in Brazil last year and has spread to almost 60 countries.  The following are some questions and answers about the virus and current outbreak: How do people become infected? Zika is transmitted to people through the bite of infected female mosquitoes, primarily the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same type that spreads dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are found in all countries in the Americas except Canada and continental Chile, and the virus will likely reach all countries and territories of the region where Aedes mosquitoes are found. The virus can also be transmitted through sex, from either a male or female partner who has been infected, and a few cases of apparent infection via blood transfusion have been reported. How do you treat Zika? There is no treatment or vaccine for Zika infection. Companies and scientists are racing to develop a safe and effective vaccine for Zika, but a preventative shot is not expected to be ready for widespread use for at least two or three years. How dangerous is it? The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that infection with the Zika virus in pregnant women is a cause of the birth defect microcephaly, a condition defined by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems, and other severe brain abnormalities in babies. The CDC said that since the causal relationship had been established, several important questions must still be answered with studies that could take years. The World Health Organization in an updated assessment said the most likely explanation is that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities including microcephaly. In addition, the agency said infection is a trigger of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis. The update from the WHO came after considering months of research. Its previous statement, based on a rapid assessment of evidence, said there was strong scientific consensus that Zika virus caused GBS, microcephaly and other neurological disorders. Brazil recently reported 1,835 confirmed cases of microcephaly believed to be linked to Zika infections in pregnant women. It is investigating more than 3,200 suspected cases of microcephaly. Current research indicates the greatest microcephaly risk is associated with infection during the first trimester of pregnancy, but health officials have warned an impact could be seen in later weeks. Recent studies have shown evidence of Zika in amniotic fluid, placenta and fetal brain tissue. What are the symptoms of Zika infection?     People infected with Zika may have a mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain and fatigue that can last for two to seven days. But as many as 80 percent of people infected never develop symptoms. How can Zika be contained? Efforts to control the spread of the virus focus on eliminating mosquito breeding sites and taking precautions against mosquito bites such as using insect repellent and mosquito nets. U.S. and international health officials have advised pregnant women to avoid travel to Latin American and Caribbean countries, sections of Miami, Florida in the United States and Singapore where they may be exposed to Zika. They are also advising that men and women who have traveled to Zika outbreak areas use condoms or abstain from sex for six months to prevent sexual transmission of the virus. How widespread is the outbreak? Active Zika outbreaks have been reported in at least 58 countries or territories, most of them in the Americas, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Brazil has been the country most affected. (1.usa.gov/1ovAJyh) Africa (1): Cape Verde  Americas (48): Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Aruba, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Bonaire, Brazil, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Curaao, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Saba, Puerto Rico, Saint Barthelmy, Saint Lucia, Saint Martin, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Eustatius, St. Maarten, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos, United States, U.S. Virgin Islands and Venezuela. Asia (1): Singapore Oceania/Pacific Islands (8): American Samoa, Fiji, Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Tonga.  What is the history of the Zika virus? The Zika virus is found in tropical locales with large mosquito populations. Outbreaks of Zika have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Southern Asia and the Western Pacific. The virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys and was first identified in people in 1952 in Uganda and Tanzania, according to the WHO.  What other complications are associated with Zika? Zika has also been associated with other neurological disorders, including serious brain and spinal cord infections. The long-term health consequences of Zika infection are unclear. Other uncertainties surround the incubation period of the virus and how Zika interacts with other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue. ",politicsNews,"September 12, 2016 ",1
"Suffering from pneumonia, Clinton falls ill at 9/11 memorial, cancels California trip"," (This version of the Sep. 11 story corrects the condition to hypothyroidism in paragraph 28) By Amanda Becker NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton is suffering from pneumonia, the Democratic presidential candidates personal doctor said on Sunday after she fell ill at a Sept. 11 memorial, an episode that renewed focus on her health less than two months before the election. Clinton canceled a trip she was scheduled to take to  California on Monday for fundraising and other campaign events, an aide said, declining to provide further details about her schedule for the week.  Clinton, 68, was diagnosed on Friday but her condition only came to light several hours after a video on social media appeared to show her swaying and her knees buckling before being helped into a motorcade as she left the memorial early Sunday.   Clinton had a medical examination when she got back to her home in Chappaqua, New York, according to a campaign aide. Her doctor, Lisa Bardack, said in a statement that she has been experiencing a cough related to allergies and that an examination on Friday showed it was pneumonia. She was put on antibiotics and advised to rest and modify her schedule. While at this mornings event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely, Bardack said. Clintons pneumonia diagnosis comes at a crucial time in the White House race against Republican rival Donald Trump, who refrained from commenting on her health on Sunday. The first of three presidential debates is on Sept. 26 and the election is on Nov. 8. Democratic National Committee head Donna Brazile said she was encouraged that Clinton already is feeling better and  looked forward to seeing her back out on the campaign trail and continuing on the path to victory. Several Clinton allies said the incident underscored the candidates resilience. After being diagnosed with pneumonia, Hillary Clinton ran a two-hour national security meeting, gave a press conference, and spent an hour and a half in the heat at a September 11 event, said Peter Daou, who worked for Clinton in the past and now has a communications firm. It was an impressive feat of physical strength that undermined weeks of health conspiracies. Clinton abruptly departed the high-profile, televised event at Ground Zero and was taken to her daughter Chelseas home in Manhattan. She emerged around two hours later on a warm and muggy morning, wearing sunglasses and telling reporters that she was feeling great. The video that showed her swaying and buckling with aides holding her up came from an unverified Twitter account under the name Zdenek Gazda, who did not respond to a request for comment.     The Clinton campaign did not respond to repeated requests for comment about the authenticity of the video. Political strategists said the campaign should confront the health issue head-on to tamp down any concerns, particularly as Republican rival Donald Trump and some of his high-profile supporters have repeatedly argued that she lacked the stamina to battle adversaries abroad. Bud Jackson, a Virginia-based Democratic strategist, said the statement from the doctor was a good start. He said the incident should encourage more transparency from the campaign about her health. I think they did the right thing. They had her examined and put out a statement. It means less speculation, he said. As the solemn ceremony began at the site of the World Trade Center that was attacked by two hijacked airliners 15 years ago, there was patchy sunlight, with temperatures at about 80 degrees Fahrenheit (26.6 Celsius). But the high humidity early into the ceremony caused it to feel much hotter in the crowd at times.  Clinton wore a high-collared shirt and a dark pant suit and donned sunglasses for the morning event.  Clintons pneumonia diagnosis follows a wave of conservative conspiracy theories that circulated in recent weeks suggesting that Clintons coughing was a sign of deeper problems. Clintons speech at a campaign rally earlier this month in Cleveland was interrupted by a coughing spell. During the speech, she quipped, Every time I think about Trump I get allergic. She then resumed her speech. Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert and senior associate at the UPMC Center for Health Security in Pittsburgh who is not treating Clinton, said coughing is a cardinal symptom of pneumonia.  Recovery from pneumonia, the 8th leading cause of death in the United States, can be variable, he said, adding it takes a week for most patients to get better. Adults above the age of 65 are at heightened risk. Past presidential candidates have released much more detailed information about their health than either Trump, 70, or Clinton. For example, John McCain, the failed 2008 Republican presidential nominee, allowed reporters to see 1,173 pages of medical records after concerns were raised about a cancer scare. Clinton has been in the news before for serious health issues. In December 2012, she suffered a concussion and shortly afterward developed a blood clot. In a letter released by her doctor in July 2015, Clinton was described as being in excellent health and fit to serve in the White House. It noted that her current medical conditions include hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies. The diagnosis and illness on Sunday come after some tough days for Clinton, as national polls showed her lead over Trump diminishing. A Reuters/Ipsos poll of likely voters showed an 8-point lead for Clinton had vanished by the last week of August.  On Saturday, Clinton came under fire from Republicans and on social media for saying Friday night that half of Trumps supporters belonged in a basket of deplorables. She later said she regretted using the word half. [nL1N1BM0BH]      Trump has also been under pressure to release detailed information on his health and medical history. Instead, in December, Trumps doctor wrote in a short letter that was made public that his blood pressure and laboratory results were astonishingly excellent and that he would be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.

U.S. congresswoman urges Labor Department to probe Chipotle over wage theft allegations,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A U.S. congresswoman urged the Labor Department on Monday to investigate Chipotle Mexican Grill for possible wage theft, another potential hurdle for the burrito chain as it seeks to rebound from food-safety problems last year. U.S. Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut, said the department should probe allegations from about 10,000 current and former Chipotle employees who have joined a federal lawsuit that alleges the company did not properly pay them for hours worked. Such actions, if true, would contradict federal law, DeLauro said in a letter to the department, depriving workers of the wages and earnings to which they are legally entitled. Chipotle said her call for an investigation was misdirected. We have maintained from the outset that this case is without merit and will vigorously defend our employment practices, company spokesman Chris Arnold said. The Labor Department had no immediate comment. Chipotle has been working to revive sales growth after outbreaks of E. coli, norovirus and salmonella linked to its restaurants sickened more than 500 people last year and drove away customers. Last week, activist investor William Ackman disclosed that his hedge fund had purchased a 9.9 percent stake in the company, saying it was undervalued. The case over unpaid wages began two years ago when Leah Turner, who worked as a manager at a Chipotle restaurant in Colorado, alleged in a lawsuit that the company routinely required hourly paid employees to work off the clock, according to court records.  The company used timekeeping devices that automatically punched employees off the clock, even if they were still working, the lawsuit said. Since then, about 10,000 others from across the country have joined the lawsuit seeking to recover unpaid wages, said Andrew Quisenberry, an attorney representing the workers for law firm Bachus & Schanker. The large number of plaintiffs is significant to us, showing that its widespread across Chipotle, Quisenberry said. The case is Tuner et al vs Chipotle Mexican Grill, U.S. District Court, District of Colorado, No. 14-cv-02612. ",politicsNews,"September 12, 2016 ",1

Would-be Reagan assassin released from psychiatric hospital,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Would-be presidential assassin John Hinckley Jr. was released from a psychiatric hospital on Saturday, media reports said, 35 years after he shot U.S. President Ronald Reagan in an attack prompted by a deranged obsession with the actress Jodie Foster. Hinckley, 61, is moving in with his elderly mother in a gated community in Williamsburg, Virginia, where he has been making increasingly long furlough visits in recent years under the watchful eyes of the U.S. Secret Service. A federal judge in July ordered Hinckleys release from St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, finding that he no longer posed a danger to himself or to others. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity at a 1982 trial and was diagnosed with depression and psychosis, both of which are now in remission, according to his doctors. Local media, including The Washington Post, reported that Hinckley was officially released from St. Elizabeths on Saturday, when he had been scheduled to be freed. A hospital employee who answered the phone on Saturday said she could not comment on patients to the media. Residents of the town have seemed largely unfazed by the prospect of Hinckleys release, though some have expressed wariness. As a 25-year-old college dropout, Hinckley had grown fixated upon Foster and the Martin Scorsese film Taxi Driver, in which she played a teenage prostitute. Inspired by the films main character, who plots to kill a presidential candidate, Hinckley opened fire on Reagan outside a Washington, D.C., hotel on March 30, 1981, in a misguided effort to win Fosters affections. Reagan suffered a punctured lung but recovered quickly. His press secretary, James Brady, was left permanently disabled and eventually died of his injuries in 2014. The shooting left its mark in a number of ways. The Brady shooting helped launch the modern gun control movement, and a 1993 bill named after him imposed background checks and a waiting period. Hinckleys verdict, meanwhile, led several states to rewrite their laws to make insanity defenses more difficult, and the Secret Service toughened its security procedures following the assassination attempt. Hinckleys release has dozens of conditions attached, including a requirement that he work or volunteer at least three days a week, limit his travel, allow law enforcement to track his movements and continue meeting with a psychiatrist. The Reagan family issued a statement in July strongly opposing Hinckleys release. Foster has declined to comment on Hinckley since 1981. ",politicsNews,"September 10, 2016 ",1
Trump closes in on Clinton's projected electoral lead: Reuters/Ipsos Poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump appears to have carved out a wider path to the White House as a number of states including Florida and Ohio are no longer considered likely wins for Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project released on Saturday. The project, which combines opinion polls with an analysis of voting patterns under different election scenarios, still shows Clinton would have the best chance of winning the presidency if the Nov. 8 election were held today. Yet Trump has caught up to her level of support in several states. Clinton now has an 83 percent chance of winning the election by an average of 47 votes in the Electoral College, the body that ultimately selects the president. In late August, the States of the Nation estimated that Clinton had a 95 percent chance of winning by an average of 108 electoral votes. Over the past few weeks, Clintons lead in the national polls has slipped considerably. Polls tend to narrow as  Election Day nears, and the Clinton campaign has struggled to overcome controversy about how she handled classified information while serving as secretary of state. A separate Reuters/Ipsos poll of likely voters showed an 8-point lead for Clinton has vanished since the last week of August.    Clinton is still favored to win 17 states, including many with large, urban populations such as New York, New Jersey and California that heavily influence the outcome of the election. Trump would likely win 23 states, many of them with smaller populations. The number of states projected for Clinton has dropped over the past few weeks. Two of those states, Ohio and Florida, were considered likely wins for Clinton in late August. Now the candidates are about even in support. Five more states, including Michigan and North Carolina are also up for grabs.  The sample size was insufficient to determine the outcome in Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska and the District of Columbia, though Alaska usually votes Republican and Washington D.C. for the Democratic Party candidate. The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project is driven by an online survey that gathers responses from about 15,000 people per week. Their responses are weighted according to the latest population estimates, and each respondent is ranked according to their likelihood to vote.  Once the poll is complete, the project tallies the levels of support and estimated error for both candidates, and then runs multiple election simulations given their respective support.

"Clinton, Trump escalate fight in dramatic week on national security","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton clashed over national security again on Friday, with Trump calling his Democratic rival trigger-happy and Clinton arguing his proposals would make the world a more dangerous place. The two White House hopefuls have waged a running battle this week over who is best placed to command the worlds most powerful military, with both touting their support from retired military leaders and attacking their opponents temperament and judgment. Trump also injected drama into the national security debate this week by wholeheartedly endorsing Russian President Vladimir Putin as a strong leader who has fared better than U.S. President Barack Obama. Clinton, many Democrats and even some in his own Republican party balked.   Trump, speaking on Friday at the conservative Value Voters summit in Washington, painted Clinton as a massive failure while she was Americas top diplomat from 2009 to early 2013, blaming her for the current turmoil in the Middle East. The problem is, Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy. Her tenure has brought us only war, destruction and death. Shes just too quick to intervene, invade, or to push for regime change, he said at the summit. Meanwhile in New York, Clinton met with national security and foreign policy experts who are supporting her campaign to discuss terrorism. She touted the bipartisan nature of the meeting and vowed to work across the aisle as president to tackle national security challenges. The nominee on the other side promises to do things that will make us less safe, Clinton told reporters at a news conference on Friday afternoon. National security experts on both sides of the aisle are chilled by what theyre hearing from the Republican nominee. Both candidates are hoping to capitalize on concerns about national security and paint their opponents as unqualified leading into the Nov. 8 presidential election. Trumps speech on Friday comes after the candidate took the unusual step of criticizing U.S. policy in a program aired on Thursday night on Russian government-funded television network, RT, a 24-hour news channel that broadcasts in both English and Russian. He said he disagreed with the U.S. decision to invade Iraq in 2003 and that Obama botched the withdrawal. Its a war we shouldnt have been in, number one, Trump said in the interview. And its a war that, when we got out, we got out the wrong way. Thats Obama. Critics of the network, which mostly targets audiences outside of Russia, have described it as a propaganda arm of  Putins government. American presidential candidates are not prone to condemn  their country before a foreign audience, even if they are fierce critics of the current administration while campaigning in the United States. Trump has said far worse about Obama in appearances on U.S. television networks. Clinton blasted Trump for appearing on the network and praising Putin, as he had done on Wednesday night during a televised national security forum.  Every day that goes by this just becomes more and more of a reality television show, Clinton said. Its not a serious presidential campaign, and it is beyond ones imagination to have a candidate for president praising a Russian autocrat like Vladimir Putin. The White House said it had no comment on Trumps remarks.  The New York businessman also said on RT on Thursday he did not think Russias government was behind the hack of Democratic National Committee email servers, and doubted it was trying to interfere in the U.S. election. Experts inside and outside the government have pointed to Russian-backed actors as the source of the hack, which has been used to leak information in an attempt to embarrass Democrats. Trump, in his speech on Friday, stuck to his belief that the United States and Russia can work together to defeat Islamic State militants. He said any nation that wants to join the United States against ISIS is welcome. That includes Russia, he said. If they want to join us in knocking out ISIS, thats just fine as far as Im concerned.    Trump also sought on Friday to blame Clinton after reports that North Korea had tested a nuclear weapon, arguing it was the fourth such test since the Democrat became secretary of state in 2009 and that she should have ended the nations nuclear program before her tenure ended. Its just one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state, Trump said. Clinton called the North Korea test outrageous and unacceptable, saying she supports imposing additional U.S. and United Nations sanctions. It will be on the top of my list in dealing with China on how were going to prevent what could very well be a serious conflict with North Korea, she said. ",politicsNews,"September 9, 2016 ",1
Clinton regrets calling 'half' of Trump supporters 'deplorable',"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Saturday said she regretted saying half of Republican rival Donald Trumps supporters belonged in a basket of deplorables, but made no apologies for calling out prejudice and paranoia among Trumps campaign and supporters. Last night I was grossly generalistic, and thats never a good idea. I regret saying half - that was wrong, Clinton said in a statement, the day after comments at a fundraiser in New York. But Trump has built his campaign largely on prejudice and paranoia, she said, adding: I wont stop calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in this campaign. Republicans and Trump supporters responded fiercely on social media to Clintons remarks at the LGBT fundraiser and the episode threatened to distract from her efforts to paint Trump as unqualified for the presidency.  But Trump on Saturday sought to use Clintons comments to make the same charge about her. How can she be President of our country when she has such contempt and disdain for so many great Americans? a Trump  statement asked. Hillary Clinton should be ashamed of herself, and this proves beyond a doubt that she is unfit and incapable to serve as President of the United States, he added.  At Friday nights fundraiser, Clinton said Trump had given voice to hateful rhetoric through his behavior as a candidate for the White House in the Nov. 8 election.  To just be grossly generalistic, you can put half of Trumps supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables, Clinton said. Unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up.  Some of those were irredeemable, she said, but they did not represent America. The other basket of Trumps supporters constituted individuals desperate for change who felt let down by the government and the economy, Clinton added. They dont buy everything he says, but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different, Clinton said.  Those are people we have to understand and empathize with, as well. Trumps campaign hammered on Clinton throughout the day. Hillary Clintons low opinion of the people that support this campaign should be denounced in the strongest possible terms, Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana and Trumps running mate, said at the Values Voter Summit in Washington. So let me just say from the bottom of my heart: Hillary, they are not a basket of anything. They are Americans, and they deserve your respect. Trump, a New York businessman who has never run for political office before, regularly says things that some consider insulting, racist or off-color. On Friday night, he told supporters in Pensacola, Florida, that Clinton could shoot someone and not be prosecuted. Because shes being so protected, she could walk into this arena right now and shoot somebody with 20,000 people watching right smack in the middle of the heart and she wouldnt be prosecuted, okay? he said. [nL1N1BM031]   But Clintons remarks got top billing on Twitter where the  hashtag #BasketOfDeplorables was trending, with shows of  condemnation and support for Clinton. Twitter user Basketeer Vendetta, under the account Vendetta92429, tweeted a photo of Trump supporters wearing campaign T-shirts and hats, adding: Proud to be part of the #BasketOfDeplorables with my fellow Americans. And Trump himself tweeted: Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls! But some Twitter users agreed with Clinton, referencing  remarks by Trump that have been called racist, such as when he described some Mexican immigrants drug dealers and rapists. Clintons comment could nevertheless end up being a boon to Trump. As long as Trump stays out of the way and doesnt overshadow Hillarys comment, her basket of deplorables comment should dominate the media in the coming days and runs the risk of negatively defining her campaign, said Republican strategist Doug Heye. Republican strategist Ana Navarro, who has been highly critical of Trump, said Clinton might have crossed an important line. When you are running for President, you are running to represent all Americans, even the ones you think are deplorable, said Navarro. But Jamal Simmons, a Democratic consultant, said the remarks probably would not wrest voters from Clinton. Were moving to the part of the election process where theres a lot less persuasion of new voters and more persuasion of the people who like you to turn out and work to elect you, he added. Many of Clintons fundraisers have been closed to the media, but not the one on Friday night.   Some critics likened Clintons observation to 2012 Republican candidate Mitt Romneys 47 percent comment in which he said 47 percent of voters are dependent upon the government and would vote for President Barack Obama no matter what. His campaign struggled to recover after the remark leaked.  But Democratic strategist Jim Manley, who supports Clinton, pointed out that Romney was talking about all voters, and Clinton was specifically describing Trump supporters.

Democrats settle with Arizona officials in suit over primary voting problems,"(Reuters) - The Democratic National Committee on Friday said it settled part of a federal lawsuit over the actions of Arizona poll officials during the presidential primary that caused voters long waits and critics said disenfranchised some, especially minorities.   The suit, filed in April in U.S. District Court in Arizona, targeted the decision to sharply cut polling locations in Maricopa County, causing waits of up to five hours for those casting ballots during the March 22 primary. This is a great victory for Arizonans, and for our democracy, Donna Brazile, interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement. We know that long lines depress turnout. Representatives for the Maricopa County Board of Directors, the Maricopa County Recorders Office and the Secretary of State did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The election had been mired in controversy from the outset, with polling sites cut to 60, down from 200 in 2012, in a move that officials said was designed to cut costs. County officials were quick to take blame for the cuts, saying they misjudged voter turnout, based on recent history and increasing mail-in votes.  Maricopa County miscalculated voter turnout and underestimated the number of vote centers needed for the March presidential primaries, the Democratic National Committee said in the statement. As part of the settlement, Maricopa County election officials agreed to consider the Democrats recommendations on polling place queuing and the use of electronic management systems, a copy of the agreement showed.  The Democratic nominating contest for the Nov. 8 presidential election was won by Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders. Both their campaigns joined the lawsuit. The settlement has no bearing on other elements of the lawsuit, such as a challenge to a law banning organizers from collecting mail-in ballots from a voters home for delivery to polling locations.

"Trump says Clinton could shoot someone, not be prosecuted","PENSACOLA, Fla. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump once famously said he could shoot someone on New Yorks Fifth Avenue and not lose voters. Now he says his rival Hillary Clinton could shoot someone in an arena in front of 20,000 people and not be prosecuted. At a rally on Friday before thousands of cheering supporters in Pensacola, Florida, Trump had more harsh words for the Democratic presidential nominee in the fallout over their crossfire at a televised national security forum in New York on Wednesday. Because shes being so protected, she could walk into this arena right now and shoot somebody with 20,000 people watching right smack in the middle of the heart and she wouldnt be prosecuted, okay? he said. That is whats happened to this country. I never thought Id see the day where this has happened to our country, he added. Trumps charge is that Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state and former U.S. senator, has profited from a rigged political system. He has repeatedly denounced the FBIs decision not to prosecute Clinton for her use of a private email server and the handling of classified information.  As a newcomer to politics, Trump has used colorful language in the past to describe fervent support for him. I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldnt lose voters, Trump said at a campaign rally in Iowa last January. ",politicsNews,"September 10, 2016 ",1
Trump vows harsh response to Iranian vessels that harass U.S. Navy,"PENSACOLA, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed on Friday that any Iranian vessels that harass the U.S. Navy in the Gulf would be shot out of the water if he is elected on Nov. 8. Trump, at a rally before thousands of supporters in Pensacola, Florida, laid out an aggressive national security policy with a beefed-up U.S. military so strong that nobodys going to mess with us. He talked tough about how he would respond to any Iranian harassment of American ships in the Gulf. A U.S. Navy coastal patrol ship changed course after an Iranian fast-attack craft came within 100 yards (91 meters) of it on Sunday. It was the fourth such incident in the past month. When they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they shouldnt be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water, he said. Trump has based his foreign policy beliefs on keeping the United States out of what he called endless wars in the Middle East. Visiting a city with a U.S. Navy base and where many military veterans live, Trump said he wants a stronger military to project American power and bolster the United States as the leader of the world. Trump this week laid out a plan to spend many billions of dollars on bolstering the U.S. military, including more ships, planes and troops. Were going to put us in a position of leadership of the world again so we can negotiate from a position of great, great strength. But more important than negotiating, we will be secure again, he said. Trump, who has drawn criticism for his frequent praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin, also mentioned a recent incident in which a Russian fighter jet came within 10 feet (3 meters) of a U.S. Navy surveillance plane over the Black Sea. Putin laughs, believe me, he laughs at our leaders. Yesterday he had a plane 10 feet away, taunting us, toying with us, just like Iran, he said. ",politicsNews,"September 10, 2016 ",1
Trump campaign releases tax returns for Republican VP nominee Pence,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps Republican presidential campaign, widely criticized for refusing to release the candidates tax returns, released 10 years of returns on Friday for vice presidential nominee Mike Pence. The Trump campaign also repeated a pledge that Trump would release his own returns once the government completes an audit. Pences returns for 2006 to 2015 showed the Indiana governor and former U.S. congressman paid an effective tax rate that ranged from 10 percent to 16.5 percent. These returns are being released with the full support of Mr. Trump who plans to release his tax returns upon completion of a routine audit, the campaign said. Disclosure of tax returns is a standard procedure for all modern presidential candidates. Trumps critics, including the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, have suggested he may be hiding something. Some have speculated that Trump may pay little or no tax or that his net worth may be much less than the $10 billion he has claimed.  Pence and his wife, Karen, reported adjusted gross income over the 10 years ranging from about $113,000 last year to over $187,000 in 2009, while the effective state and federal tax rate ranged from a low of just over 10 percent in 2013 to a high of 16.5 percent in 2014, the figures show.  Charitable donations amounted to 10 percent of the familys take-home pay, equivalent to an average 7.2 percent of adjusted gross income, a statement released by the Trump campaign said. Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns last month. They showed she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent. Most of the income came from Bill Clintons speaking fees and a book deal by Hillary. Clintons running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns at the same time in August. They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent on income of about $313,000 in 2015. ",politicsNews,"September 10, 2016 ",1
U.S. House votes to allow Sept. 11 families to sue Saudi Arabia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation on Friday that would allow the families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabias government for damages, despite the White Houses threat to veto the measure. The U.S. Senate in May unanimously passed the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, known as JASTA. The bills passage in the House by voice vote, two days before the 15th anniversary of the attacks that killed about 3,000 people, was greeted with cheers and applause in the chamber. We can no longer allow those who injure and kill Americans to hide behind legal loopholes, denying justice to the victims of terrorism, said Republican Representative Bob Goodlatte, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Fifteen of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers who crashed airliners in New York, outside Washington and in Pennsylvania were Saudi nationals. The Saudi government, which strongly denies responsibility, has lobbied against the bill. Opponents of the measure said it could strain relations with Saudi Arabia and lead to retaliatory laws that would allow foreign nationals to sue Americans for alleged involvement in terrorist attacks. The White House on Friday reiterated that President Barack Obama would veto the bill. But some members of Congress have become increasingly restive about relations with Saudi Arabia, long an important player in U.S. Middle East policy. On Thursday, four senators introduced a resolution seeking to block a $1.15 billion arms sale to the kingdom, after 64 House members signed a letter in August asking Obama to delay the sale. If Obama carries out the veto threat and the required two-thirds of both the Republican-majority House and Senate still support the bill, it would be the first time since Obamas presidency began in 2009 that Congress had overridden a veto. The House passed the measure by voice vote, without objections or recorded individual votes. That could make it easier for Obamas fellow Democrats to uphold his veto later without officially changing their positions. JASTA would remove sovereign immunity, preventing lawsuits against governments, for countries found to be involved in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. It also would allow survivors, and relatives of those killed in them to seek damages from other countries. In this case, it would allow suits to proceed in federal court in New York as lawyers try to prove that the Saudis were involved in the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Backers say passage is long overdue. They argue that if Saudi Arabia, or any other government, is innocent of involvement in attacks, they have nothing to fear from the legislation. If theyve done nothing wrong, they have nothing to worry about, said Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, a vocal advocate for the measure. Previous versions of the bill had stalled in Congress because they provided fewer protections for countries against lawsuits. Lawmakers had been under intense pressure from the Sept. 11 families to pass JASTA before the 15th anniversary of the attacks on Sunday. A member of the French parliament, Pierre Lellouche, said he would consider retaliatory legislation in France, and would anticipate it elsewhere, if the final version of JASTA does not include waivers for countries that are U.S. allies and actively involved in fighting terrorism. It may trigger similar acts all over the place, and then you enter into a state of jungle where everybody sues everybody, Lellouche, who runs a parliamentary committee on international law, told reporters on a conference call on Friday.

Obama to meet U.S. Congress leaders Monday on spending,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama has invited congressional leaders to the White House on Monday in an attempt to break deadlocks over government spending plans and funding the fight against the Zika virus. Congress must pass a temporary spending bill by Sept. 30 or much of the federal government will shut down. With the deadline approaching, Obama is set to meet with House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, both Republicans. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid and his House counterpart Nancy Pelosi will also be present, White House and congressional officials said on Friday. Of particular urgency is a program to fight the Zika virus which is running out of money, U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden told reporters.  Frieden also noted the virus, which can cause severe birth defects, would pose a threat well into 2017. Zika is likely to become endemic in this hemisphere, he told reporters. Congressional leaders are considering attaching as much as $1.1 billion in Zika spending to a bill to temporarily fund the government during the 2017 fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. Congress has yet to approve individual appropriations bills to fund the government in fiscal 2017. If no spending is approved before the end of September, much of the government would have to shut down. House Republican leaders are considering a Senate Republican proposal to extend the current government spending levels until Dec. 9, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, a Republican, told reporters. Rogers said he wants the package to include funding to combat Zika, but that this was being negotiated. On Thursday, Pelosi called for a temporary funding measure that would include a full years funding to combat Zika. In February, Obama asked Congress to approve $1.9 billion in emergency funds to deal with Zika. Since then, both political parties have backed $1.1 billion, but fights over side issues related to abortion have divided them. One of the biggest controversies involves Democrats opposition to Republican-proposed language that Democrats say would prevent Zika funds for abortion providers like Planned Parenthood, mainly in Puerto Rico. A spending bill expiring in December would provide time this autumn for lawmakers to negotiate spending levels for the rest of fiscal 2017. Some House conservatives oppose the idea, preferring to leave decisions up to the next president and a new Congress that take office in January. ",politicsNews,"September 9, 2016 ",1
Justice Dept. group studying national security threats of internet-linked devices,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has formed a threat analysis team to study potential national security challenges posed by self-driving cars, medical devices and other Internet-connected tools, a senior official said. The new groups goal is to secure the so-called internet of things from exploitation by terrorist threats and by others who might try to hack devices to cause loss of life or achieve political or economic gain, according to Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, head of the Justice Departments national security division. The impetus for the team, which has been informally active for about six months, was an understanding that the internet is vulnerable to cyber attacks partly because it was not designed with security in mind, Carlin told Reuters, after announcing the group on Thursday at the Intelligence and National Security Alliance conference in Washington.  Carlin said the group, a small team of about five to 10 people, did not want to be alarmist about new technologies such as self-driving cars, but that it wanted to identify and address security challenges presented by the internet of things before they are exploited. He cited the July truck attack in Nice, France, in which 86 people were killed, as an example of how automated driving systems could present a national security threat if they were remotely hijacked. The internet on wheels ... clearly is going to present national security risks as this transformation takes place, Carlin said.  Transportation and public health experts say that self-driving cars could dramatically reduce auto fatalities and injuries, most of which are due to human error. Car hacking has grown as a cyber security concern in recent years. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a bulletin in March warning that motor vehicles were increasingly vulnerable to hacking. 	 In July 2015, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV  recalled 1.4 million U.S. vehicles to install software after a magazine report raised concerns about hacking, the first action of its kind for the auto industry. Carlin said he has been to Detroit twice in the past six months on trips that included visits with auto industry executives to discuss national security issues surrounding smart cars. The group is being led by Adam Hickey, acting deputy assistant attorney general of the national security division, and will include industry experts and partnerships with other federal agencies, a Justice Department spokesman said.

Supreme Court rejects Michigan straight-ticket voting appeal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday rejected a bid by Michigan to reinstate its Republican-backed ban on straight-ticket voting for the Nov. 8 general election.   The justices left in place a decision by a federal district judge in Michigan who in July suspended a law that abolished straight-ticket voting, the practice of using one mark to vote for all candidates from one party, finding that it would disproportionately affect black voters.  The 6th U.S. Court of Appeals upheld that finding last month, prompting the state to seek a stay from the Supreme Court. Two conservative justices on the eight-member court, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, voted to grant the request, the brief order said.    The Michigan law, passed by a Republican-controlled legislature and signed by a Republican governor, was one of numerous voting measures passed at the state level that put new restrictions on voting. These measures also include stricter voter-identification laws and reduction of early-voting periods before election day. Proponents of the law, enacted in January, have said most states have moved away from a straight-ticket voting option. Removing the option forces voters to study candidates and encourages voters to make decisions based on criteria other than party affiliation, they said. Opponents say voting restrictions are aimed at reducing turnout of minorities, who are more likely to vote for Democrats. U.S. District Judge Gershwin Drain in July granted a preliminary injunction sought by civil rights and labor groups who sued Michigans Secretary of State Ruth Johnson and Attorney General Bill Schuette. The judge said elimination of straight-ticket voting would be a burden on voting rights and cause long wait times at polls. After Fridays decision, Schuette said, It is my duty to defend Michigans laws, in this case a law that stands in 40 other states. Now the U.S. Supreme Court has spoken and I will respect that decision. The case is one of several voting disputes being litigated ahead of the election and is the second emergency application the Supreme Court has recently been asked to handle. On Aug. 31, the court rejected a bid by North Carolina to reinstate for Novembers elections several voting restrictions, including a requirement that people show identification at the polls. The high court is short one justice following the death of conservative Antonin Scalia in February. As a result the court is evenly split 4-4 between liberals and conservatives.

White House: Obama would veto bill allowing 9/11 families to sue Saudis,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Friday reiterated that President Barack Obama would veto a bill that would allow the families of the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabias government for damages. The House of Representatives was expected to vote on the bill on Friday. The Senate passed it unanimously in May.

Clinton spokeswoman defends drug plan after Pfizer comments,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Presidential candidate Hillary Clintons spokeswoman said on Friday Clintons plan to curb drug spending was not the blow to medical innovation that Pfizer Inc Chief Executive Ian Read described it as being on Thursday. Throughout this campaign, Hillary Clinton has called for expanding investments in innovation for healthcare, from a cure for Alzheimers tobuilding on Vice President Bidens Cancer Moonshot initiative, campaign spokeswoman Julie Wood said in an emailed statement. Shes said clearly that our pharmaceutical and biotech industries are great sources of innovation and she wants tosupport their development of new treatments, she said. Last week, Clinton unveiled a plan to create an oversight panel that would protect consumers from unjustified price hikes on life-saving drugs. On Thursday, while speaking at an investor conference, Read said Clintons plan would be very negative for innovation. A Pfizer spokeswoman had no further comment on Friday. Drugmakers have been criticized for raising drug prices in the United States, where citizens pay the most worldwide for medicines. ",politicsNews,"September 9, 2016 ",1
White House names retired Air Force general as first cyber security chief,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Thursday named a retired U.S. Air Force brigadier general as the governments first federal cyber security chief, a position announced eight months ago that is intended to improve defenses against hackers. Gregory Touhills job will be to protect government networks and critical infrastructure from cyber threats as federal chief information security officer, according to a statement. The administration of President Barack Obama has made bolstering federal cyber security a top priority in his last year in office. The issue has gained more attention because of high-profile breaches in recent years of government and private sector computers.  U.S. intelligence officials suspect Russia was responsible for breaches of Democratic political organizations and state election systems to exert influence on the Nov. 8 presidential election. Russia has dismissed the allegations as absurd. Obama announced the new position in February alongside a budget proposal to Congress asking for $19 billion for cyber security across the U.S. government. The job is a political appointment, meaning Obamas successor can choose to replace Touhill after being sworn in next January. Touhill is currently a deputy assistant secretary for cyber security and communications at the Department of Homeland Security.  He will begin his new role later this month, a source familiar with the matter said. Touhills responsibilities will include creating and implementing policy for best security practices across federal agencies and conducting periodic audits to test for weaknesses, according to the announcement. Grant Schneider, who is the director of cyber security policy at the White Houses National Security Council, will be  acting deputy to Touhill, according to the announcement.

"Trump would spend billions more on military, but for what? experts ask","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps U.S. military buildup plan would cost hundreds of billions of dollars - but with no apparent strategy, defense experts from across the political spectrum said on Thursday. I havent seen any kind of strategy, said William Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy. He (Trump) says nobody is going to challenge us because we will be so strong. But thats not a strategy. Its just a kind of wish-fulfillment. U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions, a top Trump backer who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the proposal was based on recommendations from groups such as the National Defense Panel and served as a statement of Trumps commitment to build the military. I believe this lays out a framework for rebuilding the military, and it represents a commitment by Donald Trump to make this a priority, Sessions said in an interview. If you dont have presidential leadership really defending the need for a robust national defense, youre not going to maintain the defense budget. Trumps proposal, unveiled in a speech on Wednesday, did not spell out how he would accommodate the additional manpower and hardware as the United States shutters military bases, or where and for what purposes the larger forces would be employed. There were no cost estimates and Trump proposed revenue-raising steps that budget experts called insufficient. He just called for higher defense spending without giving us a number and without telling us how he is going to pay for it, said Lawrence Korb, a former Reagan administration Pentagon official and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a think tank aligned with the Obama administration. Trumps Democratic opponent in the Nov. 8 election, Hillary Clinton, advocates tough defense and foreign policies, but has yet to take a stand on the size of the Pentagon budget. Stephen Miller, a Trump policy adviser, said Trumps proposal came in contrast to Clinton, who he said has no military plan. Trump pledged to expand the Army to 540,000 active-duty troops from its current 480,000, increase the Marine Corps from 23 to 36 battalions  or as many as 10,000 more Marines  boost the Navy from 276 to 350 ships and submarines, and raise Air Force tactical aircraft from 1,100 to 1,200. Trump said those numbers were based on assessments by the conservative Heritage Foundation and other groups. Heritage said in a report that it looked at the capacity needed to handle two major wars to determine its force-size recommendations. Trump said he would bolster the development of missile defenses and cyber capabilities. He made no mention of U.S. nuclear forces already in the midst of a modernization effort that will cost an estimated $1 trillion over 30 years. To pay for the buildup, Trump said he would ask Congress to lift a Pentagon budget cap and fully offset the increased costs by collecting unpaid taxes, cutting appropriations for federal programs operating without congressional reauthorization, cracking down on social welfare fraud and other fraud, and collecting additional taxes and fees from increased energy production. SOFT-PEDALING THE COST Writing in The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, Tom Donnelly, a defense scholar at the American Enterprise Institute think tank who opposes Trumps election, praised Trump for embracing a buildup that many mainstream Republicans advocate. However, Trump undercut the power of his proposals by soft-pedaling the cost of such a buildup, he wrote. Independent cost estimates for Trumps plan range from $150 billion in additional spending over 10 years, according to the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, to as much as $900 billion over the same period, as assessed by Todd Harrison, a defense budget analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. Harrison said that increase could be achieved only by raising the federal budget deficit, raising taxes, or cutting other spending, such as benefits programs for seniors and the poor. None of those things are politically popular, he said. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that lifting the cap would cost $450 billion over 10 years. The revenue-generating steps proposed by Trump would leave $150 billion of that amount uncovered, it said. Another flaw in Trumps plan is the assumption that Republican members of the House of Representatives who belong to the deficit-fighting tea party movement would agree to end the budget cap. In April, Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley told a Senate committee that adding more soldiers without a sufficient budget would be disastrous for the country and the Army. Bases would close and programs that support troops and their families would have to be curtailed to make up the shortfall, he said. The Navy already has launched a shipbuilding program to raise the number of vessels to more than 300 by 2021. Trumps plan fails to account for the countrys limited shipbuilding capacity and the cost of manning, maintaining and basing the additional warships he proposes to build. The whole thing is unrealistic, said Dov Zakheim, the Pentagons top financial official under former President George W. Bush. Zakheim, who opposes a Trump presidency, estimates that Trumps plan would boost defense spending by roughly $300 billion over five years. Its a soundbite, he said.

"Clinton, as polls tighten, shifts focus to herself instead of Trump","KANSAS CITY, Mo. (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton reflected on her religious faith on Thursday during the first of a series of speeches her campaign said would focus on her values and vision rather than those of Republican opponent Donald Trump. The shift comes as opinion polls tighten between Clinton, the former secretary of state and U.S. senator, and Trump, a New York businessman, ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Clinton has focused many of her public remarks on criticism of Trump, including his provocative comments on illegal immigrants, Muslims and women. Trump has criticized Clintons record in public office and questioned her honesty and qualifications for the White House. But the Clinton campaign acknowledged she had to spend more time focusing her remarks on herself so voters could see the aspirational vision she hopes to enact if she becomes the first woman elected U.S. president. We believe we have to work extra hard to make sure that the positive notion of what she wants to do breaks through given the amount of interest that there is (in Trump) and what he says and also in what we say about him, Clintons communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, told reporters on her plane. Clinton will do that with speeches on the economy, children and families, and national service in the coming weeks.  She started on Thursday night with an address to the National Baptist Convention, made up primarily of African-Americans, that focused on her own religious life. Clinton spoke of teaching the occasional Sunday school class and being married for more than 40 years to former President  Bill Clinton, a Southern Baptist, despite being a lifelong Methodist herself. She told the crowd about her gruff Navy father praying by his bed every night and her mother, who experienced love during a tough childhood that grounded her faith. Reflecting on her Christianity, Clinton said Jesus Christs greatest command was to love. Were not asked to love each other. Not urged or requested. We are commanded, she said. Some days its really hard for me, she said to laughter. Clinton does not speak frequently about her faith, although she discussed its importance to her in a televised town hall event in February during her battle with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination. Her words on Thursday seemed to connect with members of the mostly black audience, who applauded and raised their hands in affirmation of many of her comments. Clinton polls strongly among black voters. Ive learned to be grateful not just for my blessings but also for my faults, and there are plenty, she said, noting the importance of humility among leaders. ",politicsNews,"September 9, 2016 ",1
Mexico president replaces finance minister after damaging Trump visit,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - President Enrique Pena Nieto on Wednesday replaced his close ally and finance minister, Luis Videgaray, after the two were heavily criticized for Republican U.S presidential candidate Donald Trumps controversial visit to Mexico last week. A somber-looking Pena Nieto told a news conference that Videgaray, who officials said was the architect of Trumps visit, would make way for former Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade. Pena Nieto was widely pilloried for hosting Trump at short notice last Wednesday. The New York businessman has repeatedly vowed to build a border wall to keep out illegal immigrants - which he said Mexico would pay for. Trump has further infuriated Mexicans by threatening to carry out mass deportations and rewrite trade treaties crucial to their economy, and by referring to some immigrants from the United States southern neighbor as rapists or drug runners With economic growth sluggish, the presidents popularity at record lows and tensions palpable between the finance minister and other Cabinet members, rumors of Videgarays impending departure had bubbled under the surface in Mexico for months. The proverbial last straw was the Trump visit, said Agustin Barrios Gomez, a politician from the opposition leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, and a driving force behind a draft bill sent to Congress this week to empower the government to retaliate against Trump if he threatens Mexican interests. (It) was seen as such a fiasco that he no longer had the credibility necessary to do his immediate job, he added. Senior diplomats said Videgaray, 48, had been instrumental in arranging the Americans visit, in which the government had hoped to impress upon Trump the need to moderate his tone and reconsider his more divisive campaign proposals. But within hours of leaving Mexico, Trump was telling a cheering crowd of supporters in Arizona that Mexico would pay for the border wall 100 percent, prompting fresh ridicule of Pena Nieto at home. Instead of teaching Trump a lesson, the visit legitimized him as a potential head of state, said Andres Rozental, a former deputy Mexican foreign minister. It just shows how little thought went into it. Trump commented on the resignation during a forum with U.S. veterans on NBC television when he was asked if the United States could take a chance with him as commander-in-chief. Well, I think absolutely, he said. I think if you saw what happened in Mexico the other day...I let them know where the United States stands. I mean, weve been badly hurt by Mexico...And if you look at what happened, look at the aftermath today where the people that arranged the trip in Mexico have been forced out of government. Thats how well we did. Videgaray ran Pena Nietos election campaign, and was long regarded as the most powerful Cabinet minister, with a huge influence on policy after orchestrating the countrys landmark energy, telecommunications, tax and education reforms. Both men were embroiled in conflict-of-interest scandals in late 2014, after Pena Nietos wife and Videgaray were found to have acquired property from a major government contractor. Pena Nieto ordered an inquiry, which cleared both of any wrongdoing. The respected new finance minister, Meade, is a friend of Videgaray and had started in the administration as foreign minister before moving to the social development ministry. Videgarays departure from the Cabinet means Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong, on whose watch capo Joaquin El Chapo Guzman escaped from prison before being recaptured, is now the most visible potential presidential candidate in 2018 for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. Polls show the main hopefuls for 2018 face a tough battle, with Osorio Chong leading prospective PRI contenders. Meade, who was also once energy minister, is among those hopefuls. He must now steer next years budget through Congress, with the draft plan to be announced on Thursday. Senator Ernesto Cordero, a former finance minister from the center-right opposition, said he expected a smooth handover to Meade, whose experience in government he underlined. Hes been a minister five times, and on those five occasions hes done a good job, Cordero said. The economy has consistently fallen short of government growth forecasts during Videgarays tenure, and contracted in the second quarter for the first time in three years. The new budget will be under close scrutiny after rating agency Standard & Poors last month said it could cut Mexicos credit rating following a marked increase in debt. Videgaray, who has also been rumored as a potential 2017 gubernatorial candidate for the PRI in the State of Mexico, a populous region next to the capital, will not take another public post, a finance ministry spokeswoman said.

Mexico's new finance minister spurns Donald Trump,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexicos new finance minister on Thursday delivered a stern reproach to Donald Trump, saying the only thing he agreed on with the U.S. Republican presidential candidate was that his predecessor in the ministry was an excellent public servant. The comments follow the resignation of Luis Videgaray as finance minister on Wednesday after he came under fire for Trumps visit to Mexico City last week, which Mexican diplomats said he was instrumental in arranging. Trump has infuriated Mexicans with a series of broadsides against the United States southern neighbor, and his hastily arranged visit to meet President Enrique Pena Nieto a week ago sparked heavy criticism of the government. Presenting the governments 2017 budget plan just a day after his appointment, the new finance minister, Jose Antonio Meade, did not mince his words when he was asked about recent comments by Trump on Videgaray at a news conference. Id like to point out that the only thing, absolutely the only thing I agree on with candidate Trump is that Luis Videgaray is an exceptional public servant, Meade said. The outspoken American real estate mogul has vowed to make Mexico pay for a border wall to keep out illegal immigrants, as well as threatening to carry out mass deportations and tear up trade treaties crucial to its economy. Late on Wednesday, Trump commented on Videgarays resignation on NBC television when he was asked if the United States could take a chance with him as commander-in-chief. Well, I think absolutely, he said. I think if you saw what happened in Mexico the other day...I let them know where the United States stands. I mean, weve been badly hurt by Mexico...And if you look at what happened, look at the aftermath today where the people that arranged the trip in Mexico have been forced out of government. Thats how well we did. In an apparent u-turn on those remarks, on Thursday Trump tweeted his appreciation for Videgaray, who was widely seen as Pena Nietos closest advisor in the Cabinet. Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Pena Nieto, he said. With Luis, Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the United States would have benefitted. Meade, a friend of Videgarays, was foreign minister when Trump launched his presidential bid in June 2015. He later moved to another ministry before his appointment on Wednesday as finance minister, a job he also held in the previous government. ",politicsNews,"September 8, 2016 ",1

"Clinton criticizes Trump for remarks on security briefing, Putin","WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton slammed Republican rival Donald Trump on Thursday for talking about things he learned in classified intelligence briefings and for praising Russias Vladimir Putin as a better leader than President Barack Obama. Speaking to reporters the day after a New York security forum featuring separate appearances by the two candidates, Clinton also criticized the businessman for saying U.S. generals had been reduced to rubble by Obamas policies. At the televised forum on Wednesday night, Trump said he was shocked by information he got during the briefing. What I did learn is that our leadership, Barack Obama, did not follow what our experts ... said to do, Trump said. Clinton, who was secretary of state during Obamas first term, said Trumps comments on the briefing were totally inappropriate and undisciplined. I would never comment on any aspect of an intelligence briefing I received, Clinton said before boarding her campaign plane. As nominees for the Nov. 8 presidential election, she and Trump are entitled to receive intelligence briefings. Clinton said Trumps praise of Putin as a better leader than Obama was not just unpatriotic and insulting to the people of our country, as well as to our commander in chief, it is scary. It suggests he will let Putin do whatever Putin wants to do and then make excuses for him, Clinton said. Trump fired back at Clinton, saying her comments were an effort to make up for a poor performance during the security forum. Hillary Clinton is always complaining about whats wrong, he said during a campaign stop in Cleveland, where he visited a charter school and proposed federal spending on school choice programs.  I just watched her on the tarmac. She tried to make up for her horrible performance last night, Trump said. The intensifying political combat came as Clintons lead in opinion polls has slipped in recent days. The current average of polls by website RealClearPolitics puts her at 45.6 percent support, compared with Trumps 42.8 percent. Obama also hit back at Trump for criticizing his foreign policy record, saying the Republican nominee was unfit to follow him into the Oval Office and the public should press Trump on his outright wacky ideas. The televised Commander-in-Chief forum on Wednesday, attended by military veterans, was the first time Trump and Clinton had squared off on the same stage since accepting their parties White House nominations in July, although they did not appear at the same time. The forum offered a prelude to how Clinton and Trump will deal with questions of national security in their three upcoming presidential debates later in September and in October. Clinton has said her experience in government as secretary of state and a U.S. senator makes her uniquely qualified for the White House, and that Trumps series of controversial comments make him temperamentally unfit for the office. Some of Trumps foreign policy positions, such as his proposal to fight terrorism by imposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, have alarmed not just Democrats but many in his own partys leadership.  Trump, who has never held elected office, has criticized Clintons judgment for backing the 2003 Iraq war and her support for the U.S. intervention in Libya in 2011. The Republican candidate was widely criticized recently when he called her a co-founder, along with Obama, of the Islamic State militant group. Clinton, who voted in favor of the 2003 Iraq war as a senator but has since said she regrets doing so, said she would convene a meeting of bipartisan security experts on Friday to discuss the fight against Islamic State. What you didnt hear from Donald Trump last night was any plan to take on ISIS, Clinton told reporters, using an acronym for the group. Thats not only dangerous, it should be disqualifying. Trump and Clinton supporters went on the offensive on social media Wednesday night and Thursday morning, defending their candidates performances during the forum. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway spoke with Trump supporters in Congress on Thursday morning, and Trump spoke with the group by phone to thank them for their support. Some supporters shrugged off his comments about Putin. I think he is being very smart in how he addresses Putin and you know, maybe hes playing with Putins ego, said Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. Mike Pence, Trumps vice presidential running mate, told CNN it was inarguable that Putin had been a stronger leader of Russia than Obama had been in the United states. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top elected Republican official, who has frequently broken with Trump, took a sharply different view. Putin is an aggressor that does not share our interests. Vladimir Putin is violating the sovereignty of neighboring countries, Ryan told reporters at his weekly news conference.     Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus told reporters at the Cleveland rally that Trump was not endorsing Putin with his praise. He doesnt agree with his style of government. He wasnt saying that, he said. Clinton said Republicans holding or seeking office across the country should be pressed on whether they agree with Trumps comments, including his views on Putin and U.S. generals that surfaced during the forum. Republicans are just in a terrible dilemma trying to support a totally unqualified nominee, I have no sympathy for them, its their nominee, she said. ",politicsNews,"September 8, 2016 ",1
Trump says he was against Iraq war despite Howard Stern interview,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Thursday said he was against the Iraq war all along despite telling radio interviewer Howard Stern in 2002 that he favored it. Trump used the start of a speech about education at a charter school in Cleveland to push back at Democratic rival Hillary Clintons statement that his position on Iraq is pretty much like her own: She voted for the 2003 war as a U.S. senator from New York but has since disavowed the vote. At an NBC forum on Wednesday night, Clinton pointed to a September 2002 interview Trump gave to radio host Howard Stern to say that Trump had supported the war. Trump had said Yeah, I guess so, when asked about a potential conflict in Iraq.  Various fact-checkers have cited this interview to debunk Trumps statement that he was always against the war. In Cleveland, Trump cited a Jan. 28, 2003, interview he did with Fox News Neil Cavuto to say he was skeptical. In that interview, Trump said: I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned. He said in his Cleveland remarks that the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq had left a power void filled by Islamic State militants. But I was opposed to that war from the beginning, long before my interview with Howard Stern, Trump said. He also cited what he said was a March 25, 2003, interview. Just days after the war started, I was quoted as saying the war is a mess, Trump said, calling it more evidence that I had opposed the war from the start. ",politicsNews,"September 8, 2016 ",1
U.S. lawmakers to press AOL for Powell's State Department emails,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers said Thursday they will seek to recover the missing emails of Colin Powell from his time as U.S. secretary of state by going directly to AOL Inc, whose email service he used for his work. The decision came a few minutes after U.S. State Department officials testified in a hearing that the department never contacted AOL to recover the missing records, despite repeated requests by the National Archives and Records Administration over the last year. The hearing, by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, was the latest in the fallout from Hillary Clintons decision to use an unauthorized private email system for official email while secretary of state.  Clinton, the Democratic Party presidential candidate, has said her decision was wrong, but it has continued to dog her effort to defeat Republican rival Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election. Her defenders have pointed to some similarities in Powells earlier use of private email, which drew fresh scrutiny at Thursdays hearing. I dont get this, its ridiculous, said Democrat Stephen Lynch, a committee member. This is the National Archives asking you to contact AOL, but you didnt do that. Patrick Kennedy, the State Departments most senior management official, said that Powell, a Republican, never replied to the departments request to ask AOL to attempt to recover his work emails, which were not properly archived at the agency. He said the departments lawyers decided to decline the National Archives requests that the department go to AOL directly. We cannot make a request for someone elses records from their provider, Kennedy said in his testimony. That request has to be made by them. Jason Chaffetz, the Republican who chairs the committee, then agreed to a request by the committees most senior Democrat, Elijah Cummings, to try to recover the emails from AOL, using a subpoena if necessary. AOL is owned by telecommunications provider Verizon Communications Inc. A spokeswoman for Powell did not respond to a request for comment. AOL did not immediately respond to questions, and has previously said the its privacy policy precludes it from discussing a customers emails. The State Department did not have a fully functioning email system when Powell joined it in 2001, according to agency officials. Powell has said he told technology officials to set up a computer with his AOL account in order to become the first secretary of state to use email. In contrast, Clinton eschewed the official state.gov email system when she took office in 2009. Department officials have said she would not have received permission for this had she asked.

Senators seek to block $1.15 billion U.S. arms sale to Saudi Arabia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four U.S. senators introduced a joint resolution on Thursday seeking to block the U.S. sale of $1.15 billion of Abrams tanks and other military equipment to Saudi Arabia, citing issues including the conflict in Yemen. The measure was introduced by Republican Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee and Democrats Chris Murphy and Al Franken, the latest indication of strong disapproval of the deal among some U.S. lawmakers. Selling $1.15 billion in tanks, guns, ammunition, and more to a country with a poor human rights record embroiled in a bitter war is a recipe for disaster and an escalation of an ongoing arms race in the region, Paul said in a statement. In August, 64 members of the House of Representatives signed a letter urging President Barack Obama to delay the sale. The Pentagon announced on Aug. 9 that the State Department has approved the potential sale of more than 130 Abrams battle tanks, 20 armored recovery vehicles and other equipment to Saudi Arabia. The U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which implements foreign arms sales, said that General Dynamics would be the principal contractor for the sale. Introducing the resolution, the senators cited the conflict in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia is leading a coalition in support of forces loyal to the exiled government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi who are trying to oust Iran-allied Houthi forces from the capital, Sanaa. Human rights groups have criticized the coalitions air strikes because of the deaths of civilians. Thousands of civilians are being killed, and terrorist groups inside the country, like al Qaeda and ISIS, are getting stronger. Until the Saudis conduct changes, the U.S. should put a pause on further arms sales, Murphy said in a statement. Some congressional aides questioned whether Congress had the right to try to block the sale, since it has been more than 30 days since Congress was notified about it. But the four senators said the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 allows senators to force a vote on an arms sale by a president. Human rights activists applauded the resolution. Congress silence would signal to the Yemeni people that U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen is unconditional  no matter how cruel the parties methods of warfare or how unwilling they are to make peace, Scott Paul, senior humanitarian policy advisor at Oxfam America, said in a statement.

Biden asks U.S. Congress to allow unencumbered Zika funding vote,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday called on the Republican-led U.S. Congress to allow an up-or-down vote on funding to combat the Zika virus without other provisions attached, calling the health threat posed by the pathogen a national emergency. Congress has failed to approve any funding to fight the mosquito-borne virus since President Barack Obama asked for $1.9 billion in February.  Lawmakers have been deadlocked for months over a $1.1 billion funding bill. Democrats have accused Republicans of attaching controversial provisions related to abortion that they cannot accept. Republicans have accused Democrats of blocking the bill to gain political advantage by portraying Republicans as obstructionists on Zika funding. Give us an up-or-down vote, straight, on Zika, Biden said at an event on Capitol Hill with fellow Democrats from the Senate and House of Representatives. I understand attaching controversial issues to important legislation ... but this is a national emergency, Biden added. Peoples health, the well-being of unborn children, the health of the country at large, is at stake. Act. U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. There is no vaccine or treatment for Zika. Two top federal health officials also visited Congress on Thursday to underscore the importance of Zika funding. Were all hopeful that the Congress will come through with the money thats needed to respond effectively to Zika, Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters after meeting with Senate Democratic leaders alongside Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters that Democrats want Zika funding added to stop-gap legislation that Congress must pass by Oct. 1 to keep federal agencies operating.  By Zika, I mean for a year. I dont mean for three months, Pelosi said. Zika should be emergency spending. It should not be off-set (requiring cuts in other government programs), because it is an emergency.  A main issue is Democrats opposition to language, backed by Republicans, that they say would prevent Zika funds for abortion providers like Planned Parenthood, mainly in Puerto Rico. The virus, first detected in Brazil last year, has spread rapidly through the Americas. Florida is the only U.S. state so far where local mosquitoes are known to be transmitting Zika.

U.S. coal miners hit Congress to rally for pension protection,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - About 10,000 retired coal miners and their families descended on the U.S. Congress on Thursday to pressure lawmakers to pass stalled legislation that would prevent 22,000 of them from losing their pension and health benefits as soon as early 2017. A bipartisan group of senators is trying to pass legislation to ensure the retirees coverage with the United Mine Workers of Americas retirement and healthcare funds, which are dwindling as some coal companies drop benefits in their bankruptcy proceedings.  The future of the coal industry and its workers has been an issue in national politics. With just weeks to go before the presidential and congressional elections in November, time for passage of the bill is limited. The union said the federal government was obligated to ensure coal workers continue to get the benefits. The UMWA pension currently supports about 120,000 former miners and their families. These miners put in decades of back-breaking work in Americas coal mines to energize our nation, UMWA International President Cecil Roberts said. But some Republican senators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have hesitated to support the legislation, either because they do not want to be seen bailing out unionized workers or because it does not address what they say is President Barack Obamas regulatory war on the coal industry. Legislation backers say they are obligated to uphold a guarantee made in 1946 by President Harry Truman to protect the benefits to avert a strike.   Republican West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said on Wednesday that the payments were less than $600 a month.  These arent lavish pensions, she said. This is food. This is the trip to see the doctor.   If Congress fails to pass the Miners Protection Act, the $5 billion federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, an agency that backstops failed private-sector pension programs and is already financially strained, would be responsible for the plans. Mervn Click, a retired coal miner from Hueytown, Alabama, who traveled more than 20 hours by bus for the rally, said his benefits could cease by years end.  I dont know what I will do if it runs out, he said as he stood under a tree facing the Capitol. West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said 46 Democratic senators and at least eight Republicans backed the bill. Three of the Republicans - Rob Portman of Ohio, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Mark Kirk of Illinois - are up for reelection this November in tight races in coal-producing states.  Portman told the crowd he was confident the bill will pass in the Senate Finance Committee, where it will be discussed on Wednesday. We hope its a strong vote because that will get it to the (Senate) floor like a torpedo, he said. Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who is the ranking member of the Finance Committee, said he was working both sides of the aisle to make sure the bill gets passed.  Today its mine workers; tomorrow it can be woodworkers, he said, referring to his states logging industry. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who has criticized bankrupt coal companies for shirking their responsibility to pay healthcare benefits for retirees, voiced support for the bill. I firmly believe that if you spent your life keeping the lights on for our country, we cant leave you in the dark, Clinton said in a statement.  She has also proposed a $30 billion package to help coal states adapt to a changing economy. That plan has been overshadowed by a comment she made earlier this year that she would put coal companies out of business. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly pledged to put coal miners back to work but has not offered any details. His campaign was unavailable for comment. McConnell spokesman Robert Steurer told Reuters that the issue deserves an open, transparent debate through regular order.  Vera Newton, a member of the United Auto Workers Louisville, Kentucky, chapter joined her members at the rally in solidarity with the coal workers. If they lose this fight, were next, she said. Its like dominoes - if they lose their pension, other unions will follow.",politicsNews,"September 8, 2016 ",1
'What is Aleppo?' asks U.S. Libertarian Party candidate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson framed an embarrassing lapse on foreign affairs as simple human error on Thursday after he responded to a question about a flashpoint in the Syrian civil war by asking, What is Aleppo? The gaffe came during an MSNBC interview about the continuing battle for Syrias biggest city, Aleppo, which has been divided for years into government and rebel sectors and has been in the news daily in recent weeks. What would you do, if you were elected, about Aleppo, Johnson was asked.  About Aleppo. And what is Aleppo? he responded. Youre kidding? the MSNBC interviewer said.  No, Johnson said. Aleppo is in Syria. ... Its the epicenter of the refugee crisis, the interviewer said.  OK, got it. Got it, Johnson said. The embarrassing exchange followed a forum on Wednesday night in which Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump sought to showcase their national security and defense credentials.  Johnson, a former Republican governor of New Mexico, has been trying to turn the two major candidates low approval ratings to his advantage in the race to win the Nov. 8 election. However, he has just 8.6 support in the current average of opinion polls by website RealClearPolitics in a matchup with Clinton, Trump, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. While the Libertarian Party has long rejected U.S. military intervention abroad, the candidates failure to recognize one of the most troubled spots in the Middle East drew ridicule and prompted speculation that his campaign was essentially over.  Clinton, asked at a news conference about Johnsons remarks, laughed and quipped, You can look on the map and find Aleppo. In a statement after the MSNBC interview, Johnson said the mistake showed he was human and explained that, when asked about Aleppo, he was thinking of an acronym and not the Syrian war. Can I name every city in Syria? No. Should I have identified Aleppo? Yes. Do I understand its significance? Yes, he said. In the 2012 presidential election, Johnson set a record for most votes won by a Libertarian candidate - about 1 percent of the popular vote - and was aiming to attract disaffected Republicans and Democrats to sustain steady growth in the party. The Libertarian agenda promotes civil liberties and a small-government agenda. Johnson has pledged to cut spending, stick to conservative fiscal policies and legalize marijuana. Appearing on ABCs talk show The View later, Johnson reacted mildly to suggestions the gaffe would kill his campaign. I guess people will have to make that judgment, he said.

Trump campaign reverses ban on credentials for some media outlets,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday  ended his ban on press credentials for some news outlets seeking to cover his campaign events, including The Washington Post and Buzzfeed, a policy that had drawn strong criticism from press freedom advocates. Trumps ban at times also included Politico and The Huffington Post, following coverage that was critical of him. The banned organizations had continued covering his campaign, but they could not get credentials to formally attend his events, including sitting in the media section at rallies.  Those outlets now will be able to obtain media credentials, as well as travel with other reporters covering the Republican candidate, campaign spokesman Hope Hicks confirmed. Press freedom advocates strongly condemned such bans. Reporters without Borders said when the Post was banned in June that it was an act of hostility toward the media and a serious violation of press freedom. Revoking press credentials was imprudent, pointless and offensive from the start. Were pleased to see the ban come to a long-overdue end, Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron said in a statement on Wednesday. Sam Stein, senior politics editor for the Huffington Post, said on Twitter the outlet was no longer blacklisted. They even returned my email to confirm it, he said of the Trump campaign. Reporters from the banned organizations had often gained access to Trump campaign events by waiting in the same lines as the general public, but they could be tossed out by members of his security team if discovered. Trumps vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, said last month that the campaign was discussing reversing the ban, but no change had been announced before Wednesday. I figure they cant treat me any worse, Trump, a New York businessman, told CNN in a statement declaring the ban over. Trump is running against Democrat Hillary Clinton for the Nov. 8 election.

"Trump in TV event with Clinton, says Putin better leader than Obama","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump declared on Wednesday that Russias Vladimir Putin had been a better leader than U.S. President Barack Obama, as the Republican presidential nominee used a televised forum to argue he was best equipped to reassert Americas global leadership.  Trump suggested at the event in which he and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton made back-to-back appearances that U.S. generals had been stymied by the policies of Obama and Clinton, who served as the Democratic presidents first secretary of state. I think under the leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton the generals have been reduced to rubble. They have been reduced to a point thats embarrassing for our country, Trump said at NBCs Commander-in-Chief forum in New York attended by military veterans.  It was the first time Trump and Clinton had squared off on the same stage since accepting their parties presidential nominations in July for the Nov. 8 election. Clinton was grilled over her handling of classified information while using a private email server during her tenure at the State Department. FBI Director James Comey had declared her extremely careless in her handling of sensitive material but did not recommend charges against her. I did exactly what I should have done and I take it very seriously, always have, always will, she said.Trumps praise of Putin and his suggestion that the United States and Russia form an alliance to defeat Islamic State militants could raise eyebrows among foreign policy experts who feel Moscow is interfering with efforts to stem the Syrian civil war. If he says great things about me, Im going to say great things about him, Trump said of the Russian president. Certainly in that system, hes been a leader, far more than our president has been. Trump had called Obama the founder of ISIS, an acronym for Islamic State, in stump speeches several weeks ago. The statement drew broad criticism, prompting him to take a more disciplined approach to campaigning. He has since picked up ground on Clinton in national opinion polls. Trump also flirted with revealing what he had been learning in classified intelligence briefings given to him by U.S. officials because he is the Republican nominee. There was one thing that shocked me, Trump said. What I did learn is that our leadership, Barack Obama, did not follow what our experts ... said to do, and I was very, very surprised. ...Our leaders were not following what they recommended. Earlier on Wednesday, Trump pledged to launch a new U.S. military buildup, saying America was under threat like never before from foes like Islamist extremists, North Korea and China. The event offered a prelude to how Clinton and Trump will deal with questions on national security issues in their three upcoming presidential debates later in September and in October. Clinton began the forum saying her long experience in government as a U.S. senator and secretary of state made her uniquely qualified to serve as president. She said she had an absolute rock steadiness to be able to make tough decisions, a not so subtle dig at Trump, who Democrats say is temperamentally unfit for the White House. Moderator Matt Lauer doggedly pressed her about her handling of emails from a private server while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. The issue has raised questions about whether she can be trusted to serve as president. Clinton said none of the emails she sent or received were marked top secret, secret or classified, the usual way such material is identified.  Appearing in the second half of the hour-long show, Trump faced questions about his fitness for office. Asked if he would be prepared on Day One to be commander in chief, Trump said: One hundred percent. Trump quickly abandoned Lauers entreaties to avoid attacking his opponent and focus on what he would do if elected president in November. Shes been there for 30 years, Trump said. We need change, and we need it fast.  The event brought together the meticulously prepared Clinton, 68, the wife of former President Bill Clinton, and Trump, 70, a New York businessman whose brash, freewheeling style has allowed him to dominate the headlines during his campaign. Clinton said she regretted her decision as a U.S. senator from New York to vote in favor of the much-criticized 2003 Iraq war and that Trump had been in favor of it as well. Trump has condemned the war during his campaign and said he would avoid lengthy conflicts in the Middle East. On the U.S. intervention in Libya in 2011, Clinton rejected Trumps criticism of her support for the effort as secretary of state. Permitting there to be an ongoing civil war in Libya would be as threatening and as dangerous as what we are seeing in Syria, she said. Trump said Clintons handling of Libya proved disastrous. Republicans have made much of the fact that the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, was killed in an Islamist attack in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. She made a terrible mistake in Libya, said Trump. Clinton said U.S. policies under her leadership at the State Department had helped promote security. We made the world safer, she said.

"Obama says Trump unfit for presidency, has 'outright wacky' ideas","VIENTIANE (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama hit back at Donald Trump on Thursday for criticizing his foreign policy record, saying the Republican nominee was unfit to follow him into the Oval Office and the public should press him on his outright wacky ideas. Speaking in Laos at the end of the second of two Asian summits, Obama said the tycoons lack of leadership credentials was exposed whenever he spoke and American voters were aware of that. I dont think the guys qualified to be president of the United States, and every time he speaks, that opinion is confirmed, Obama told a news conference. The most important thing for the public and the press is to just listen to what he says and follow up and ask questions about what appear to be either contradictory or uninformed, or outright wacky, ideas. Trump declared on Wednesday during a televised forum attended by military veterans that Russian President Vladimir Putin had been a better leader than Obama. Trump said the progress of U.S. military generals had been stymied, or reduced to rubble with Obama as commander-in-chief and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as his first secretary of state. It was the first time Trump and Clinton had squared off on the same stage since securing their nominations in July. Obama said he believed his foreign policy legacy would be one of success, particularly his so-called rebalance to Asia. He said Asian leaders would be puzzled by Trumps remarks, and Americans would know who to choose as president on Nov. 8. I have confidence that if, in fact, people just listen to what he had to say, look at his track record or lack thereof, that theyll make a good decision, he said.

"Duterte tells regional leaders, U.S. not to lecture Philippines on rights","VIENTIANE (Reuters) - Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday defended his countrys human rights record at a regional summit in Laos, urging East Asian leaders and the United States to help Manila eradicate the scourge of illicit drugs. Duterte swept to power in May on promises to wipe out crime and corruption within six months, pledging to wage a war on drug dealers and crush widespread addiction in a country of 100 million. The toll in his governments two-month war on drugs reached 2,400 last week, with police saying about 900 people died in police operations, and the rest were deaths under investigation, a term human rights activists call a euphemism for vigilante and extrajudicial killings. Setting aside a prepared speech, Duterte spoke for more than five minutes about human rights and his campaign against drugs during the East Asian Summit in the Laotian capital of Vientiane, according to one Indonesian diplomat at the meeting. Let me tell you about human rights, the diplomat quoted Duterte as saying while displaying a picture of Filipinos killed by American soldiers about a century ago. This is my ancestors being killed, so why now we are talking about human rights? We have to talk of the full spectrum of human rights. Duterte spoke after Obama had delivered a speech that referred to human rights.    Dutertes drive has won popular support at home but the killings have drawn expressions of concern from the United States, a close Philippine ally, and the United Nations. In a tirade before the Laos summit, Duterte insulted U.S. President Barack Obama and the White House responded by cancelling a two-way meeting. Philippine officials this week handed out a 38-page pamphlet at the summit that praised Dutertes drug campaign. ",politicsNews,"September 8, 2016 ",1

U.S. lawmakers seek compromise on Zika virus funding,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers sought on Wednesday to break a logjam over $1.1 billion in funding to combat the Zika virus, with the Senate possibly considering legislation as soon as next week, even as one congressman toted a jar full of mosquitoes to the House floor to condemn congressional inaction. Can you imagine the fears and anxieties if the mosquitoes were not in this jar? Florida Republican David Jolly told his colleagues as he brandished the container holding about 100 of the insects in the House of Representatives chamber. Members of Congress would run down the hall to the physicians office to be tested, added Jolly, whose state is the first in the nation with local transmission of the mosquito-borne virus that has spread through the Americas. The potential Senate Zika measure could advance as part of a broader legislative effort to temporarily keep federal agencies operating in the 2017 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Republicans and Democrats huddled separately in closed meetings in both the Senate and House to see if they could reach a compromise during a 19-day work session this month, before lawmakers break for a recess in the weeks before the Nov. 8 U.S. election. Lawmakers returned to work this week after a seven-week summer recess. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters he was in talks with Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid. Were looking for a way forward. And Im hopeful and optimistic that well be able to do that, McConnell, a Republican, said of both a temporary agency funding bill and Zika money. In February, President Barack Obama asked Congress to approve $1.9 billion in emergency funds to deal with the Zika virus, which can cause severe birth defects when pregnant women become infected. Since then, both parties have backed $1.1 billion as the funding figure. But fights over side issues related to abortion and Obamas signature healthcare law have bitterly divided the two parties. One of the biggest controversies involves Democrats opposition to language, backed by Republicans, that they say would prevent Zika funds for abortion providers like Planned Parenthood, mainly in Puerto Rico. The Miami Herald on Tuesday quoted Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, who chairs a Senate panel overseeing healthcare funding, suggesting the Planned Parenthood language might have to be dropped in order to reach a deal. Aides to both senators declined to confirm or deny the accuracy of the quotes. Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, asked by Reuters whether she thought Planned Parenthood funding restrictions should be eliminated from Zika legislation, said: That would be my preference. Still, some Republicans were resisting a deal that would abandon the Planned Parenthood language in the Zika bill. ",politicsNews,"September 7, 2016 ",1
Justice Ginsburg hopes 'cooler heads' prevail on high court vacancy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said on Wednesday she hoped cooler heads will prevail over the vacancy on the Supreme Court, suggesting that Republicans should act on President Barack Obamas nominee. Ginsburgs comments at Georgetown Law Center came a day after Democrats in the Republican-controlled Senate renewed their push for a confirmation hearing for Obamas pick, appeals court judge Merrick Garland.  The nomination has been pending for 175 days without Senate action, the longest ever to the high court.  Republicans have said the next president should get to make the appointment because the vacancy, created by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in February, came in the final year of Obamas presidency. I do think that cooler heads will prevail, I hope sooner rather than later, Ginsburg said. Ginsburg, 83, a liberal appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1993, acknowledged that the Senate, which has the responsibility to confirm or reject judicial nominations, did not have to confirm the nominee. But she said it did have an obligation to at least consider Garland instead of taking no action at all. The president is elected for four years, not three years, she said in relation to the presidents authority to make appointments in the final year of a term. Maybe some members of the Senate will wake up and appreciate that thats how it should be. Earlier on Wednesday, Democratic senators held a press conference outside the Supreme Court demanding action on the nomination. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far held firm to his pledge to take no action. The nine-seat court has been one justice short since Scalias death. With four liberals and four conservatives now on the bench, an appointment by a Democratic president could end decades of conservative domination on the court. Ginsburg has a long track record of making sometimes outspoken public remarks, in stark contrast to most of her colleagues. In July, she issued a statement in which she said she regretted comments she made in press interviews criticizing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.  In one CNN interview she described him as a faker.",politicsNews,"September 7, 2016 ",1
Peru's central bank chief says Trump gives him 'goose bumps',"LIMA (Reuters) - The head of Perus central bank said on Wednesday he gets the goose bumps when he thinks about what would happen to the global economy if U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump wins the November election. Responding to questions from reporters on the sidelines of an economic forum, Julio Velarde called Trumps statements about scrapping trade deals and imposing tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports very dangerous. If the man does a fraction of what he says he will, we could go back to the 30s, Velarde said in reference to the Great Depression of the early 1930s. It gives me the goose bumps. The comments were videotaped and posted online by local financial daily Gestion. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The New York businessman has broken with the Republican Partys traditional embrace of free trade. He has vowed to rip up the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal to which Peru is a signatory, and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico that he blames for the loss of U.S. jobs. Trump has also threatened to slap tariffs on Chinese products to show Beijing that Washington is serious about leveling the field on trade. Velarde, named central banker of the year in 2015 by the Financial Times magazine The Banker, has headed Perus central bank since 2006 and recently agreed to stay on for a third five-year term. Perus new president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, has also voiced worries about a Trump presidency. ",politicsNews,"September 8, 2016 ",1
U.S. House Republicans to discuss whether to impeach IRS chief,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Members of the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives will discuss next week whether the nations top tax collector, John Koskinen, should be impeached over conservative charges he stonewalled a congressional investigation, House leaders said Wednesday. Democrats decried the move as a politically motivated embarrassment that would in any case be stopped in the Senate. Even some Republicans said they did not think Koskinens activities justified impeachment from his post as Internal Revenue Service (IRS) commissioner. Conservative Republicans in the House have said Koskinen failed to comply with a congressional investigation into whether the IRS applied extra scrutiny to applications for tax exempt status by conservative groups between 2010 and 2012. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other leading House Republicans have shown little interest in pursuing impeachment. But Ryan indicated Wednesday that he expected floor action because conservatives had filed a privileged resolution, which can bypass regular procedures and take precedence on the House floor. This is something that were going to have a planning conference on next week, Ryan told a regular press conference. This is something where Congress is going to work its will. The Senates Democratic leader, Harry Reid, called the process a waste, put that in big capital letters and said it could be blocked in the Senate by that chambers Majority Leader, Republican  Mitch McConnell. A spokesman for McConnell declined to say what action McConnell might take if the House does vote for Koskinens impeachment. I know Koskinen very well, another senior Senate Republican, Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch told Reuters. Yeah, hes made mistakes but he hasnt made mistakes that justify an impeachment. Koskinen became IRS commissioner in December 2013, after the controversy already had exploded over the way the agency had handled the applications for tax exempt status. Members of the House Freedom Caucus, the chambers most conservative bloc, have said Koskinen should be pushed out because of his role in the aftermath of the scandal. They noted that he was commissioner when backup tapes were destroyed containing emails from former IRS official Lois Lerner, who had headed the IRS tax-exempt division. Democrats have noted that the Justice Department brought no criminal charges against Lerner and say the case against Koskinen shows little more than agency mismanagement and misstatements.

U.S. warns Russia against interfering with Western politics,"OXFORD, England (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter on Wednesday warned Russia against interfering with Western democratic processes and accused Moscow of aggressive behaviour aimed at eroding the international order.  Carters remarks follow hacking attacks on Democratic Party organisations in the run-up to the U.S. election on Nov. 8, some of which U.S. officials and cyber security experts have blamed on hackers working for the Russian government. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has blamed Russia and expressed concern about possible Russian interference in the election. The Kremlin has denied involvement in the hacks. We dont seek an enemy in Russia. But make no mistake  we will defend our allies, the principled international order, and the positive future it affords all of us, Carter said in an address to students at Oxford University. We will counter attempts to undermine our collective security. And we will not ignore attempts to interfere with our democratic processes. Pressed by reporters, Carter said his concerns were not about the United States only but did not offer specifics, nor did he indicate whether he was referring to the hacking attacks, but he said that the NATO alliance has long worried about Russian meddling in other nations domestic affairs. U.S. Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and has called on Moscow to dig up tens of thousands of missing emails from Clintons time as head of the U.S. State Department. He later said his comments were meant to be sarcastic. Relations between Russia and United States hit a post-Cold War low in 2014 over the Ukraine crisis, and Washington and Moscow have since clashed over diverging policies in Syria. Carter sounded a pessimistic tone on diplomatic efforts between the two to try to agree a ceasefire and nudge the Syrian government towards a political transition to end the conflict. Todays news out of Syria is not encouraging. The choice is Russias to make ... and the consequences will be its responsibility, he said. On another front, U.S. officials said a Russian fighter jet carried out an unsafe and unprofessional intercept of a U.S. spy plane over the Black Sea on Wednesday. Citing Russias unprofessional behaviour in the air, space and cyberspace, Carter said: Russia appears driven by misguided ambitions and misplaced fears. It lashes out, alleging that it fears for its own viability and future, even though no nation - not the United States, not the United Kingdom - seeks to defeat it or constrain its potential, he said.

U.S. Green Party's Stein investigated in North Dakota pipeline protest,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A sheriffs department in North Dakota is investigating possible charges against the U.S. Green Party presidential candidate, Jill Stein, for damaging equipment during protests on Tuesday over construction of an oil pipeline. Stein was part of a group protesting the Dakota Access pipeline and spray-painted construction equipment, the Morton County Sheriffs Department said. Stein does not dispute the account. Protesters, who say the project will damage burial sites considered sacred to a nearby Native American tribe and pollute the areas drinking water, also attached themselves to bulldozers and broke a fence, the department said. Stein, a 66-year-old doctor and environmental activist from Massachusetts, said in a statement that she had spray-painted the words I approve this message onto a bulldozer, a nod to the phrase American politicians append to their advertisements to comply with transparency laws.  No arrests were made, the department said, and the investigation was continuing. The department also posted a picture on its Facebook page that showed Stein spraying the bulldozer, calling it a criminal act.     The $3.7 billion, 1,100-mile (1,800-km) pipeline project would be the first to move crude oil from the Bakken shale, a vast oil formation in North Dakota, to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Energy Transfer Partners is leading a group of firms to build it.  The project sparked violent clashes during the weekend between tribe members and other protesters and security officers near the construction site, and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is seeking a court order to block construction. The Green Party opposes continued investment in oil extraction because of its link to climate change. I hope the North Dakota authorities press charges against the real vandalism taking place at the Standing Rock Sioux reservation: the bulldozing of sacred burial sites and the unleashing of vicious attack dogs, Stein said in her statement. She said that pipeline security officials had used dogs and pepper spray on protesters over the weekend.  A spokeswoman for Energy Transfer Partners did not respond to a request for comment. A Reuters-Ipsos poll in late August showed Stein the first choice of 2 percent of voters, trailing Democrat Hillary Clinton, Republican Donald Trump and Libertarian Gary Johnson. The U.S. presidential election will be held on Nov. 8. Stein was arrested for trespassing in Texas during her 2012 presidential campaign when she tried to take supplies to protesters opposed to the Keystone XL pipeline.

Senate investigations panel to probe Mylan's EpiPen pricing,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senates permanent subcommittee on investigations will probe Mylan Pharmaceuticals pricing of the allergy auto-injector EpiPen, according to a press release issued on Wednesday. The release described the probe as a preliminary inquiry. Mylan has been criticized - including by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton - for sharply raising the price of EpiPens, which are carried by people with life-threatening allergies. Mylan raised the price from about $100 in 2008 to about $600 currently. It has offered some discounts but this has done little to allay concerns. Our review of this matter will be robust, thorough, and bipartisan. Parents and school districts in Ohio, Missouri and across the country need affordable access to this life-saving drug, and we share their concern over Mylans sustained price increases, Senators Rob Portman, the Republican chair of the subcommittee, and Claire McCaskill, the top Democrat, said in a statement. Mylan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ",politicsNews,"September 7, 2016 ",1
Obama administration arms sales offers to Saudi top $115 billion: report,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obamas administration has offered Saudi Arabia more than $115 billion in weapons, other military equipment and training, the most of any U.S. administration in the 71-year U.S.-Saudi alliance, a report seen by Reuters has found.  The report, authored by William Hartung of the U.S.-based Center for International Policy, said the offers were made in 42 separate deals, and the majority of the equipment has yet to be delivered. Hartung told Reuters the report would be made available publicly on Sept. 8.  The report said U.S. arms offers to Saudi Arabia since Obama took office in January 2009 have included everything from small arms and ammunition to tanks, attack helicopters, air-to-ground missiles, missile defense ships, and warships. Washington also provides maintenance and training to Saudi security forces. The Centers report is based on data from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, a Department of Defense body that provides figures on arms sales offers and Foreign Military Sales agreements. Most of the offers, which are reported to Congress, become formal agreements though some are abandoned or amended. The report did not disclose how many of the offers to Saudi Arabia were agreed.  Washingtons arms sales to Riyadh recently have come under fire from rights groups and some members of Congress are disturbed by the rising number of civilian casualties in the war in Yemen, where a coalition led by Saudi Arabia is fighting Iran-allied Houthi rebels. The conflict has killed at least 10,000 people.  Last month the United Nations human rights office said that 3,799 civilians have died in the conflict, with coalition air strikes responsible for an estimated 60 percent of the deaths. The coalition says it does not target civilians and accuses the Houthis of placing military targets in civilian areas. The coalition has created a body to investigate civilian casualties. The outcry over those casualties has led some members of Congress to push for restrictions on arms transfers, and amid the growing outcry, the Pentagon cautioned that its support for Saudi Arabia in its Yemen campaign was not a blank check. The Control Arms coalition, a group that campaigns for stricter arms sales controls, said last month that Britain, France and the United States were flouting the 2014 Arms Trade treaty, which bans exports of conventional weapons that fuel human rights violations or war crimes. Nevertheless, the Obama administration last month approved a potential $1.15 billion arms package for Saudi Arabia. Hartung said the level of U.S. arms sales to Riyadh should give it leverage to pressure Saudi Arabia. Its time for the Obama administration to use the best leverage it has - Saudi Arabias dependence on U.S. weapons and support - to wage the war in Yemen in the first place, Hartung told Reuters. Pulling back the current offer of battle tanks or freezing some of the tens of billions in weapons and services in the pipeline would send a strong signal to the Saudi leadership that they need stop their indiscriminate bombing campaign and take real steps to prevent civilian casualties. Washington has been at pains to prove to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies that it remains committed to their defense against Iran in the wake of a multinational deal last year to restrict the Iranian nuclear program. Sunni Muslim Gulf states accuse Shiite Iran of fomenting instability in the region, which the Islamic Republic denies. The more recent deals that have involved resupplying Saudi Arabia with ammunition, bombs, and tanks to replace weaponry used up or damaged in the war in Yemen are no doubt driven in part by the effort to reassure the Saudis that the U.S. will not tilt towards Iran in the wake of the nuclear deal, Hartung said.

"Mural depicts Maine governor as Klansman, Mickey Mouse","(Reuters) - A graffiti artist lampooned Maine Governor Paul LePage in a mural depicting the two-term Republican wearing a Ku Klux Klan cape and hood, two weeks after he left a profane voicemail for a Democratic lawmaker he believed had called him a racist. The mural, which appeared over the weekend in Portland on a wall where graffiti is allowed by law, has been repainted to remove the reference to the white supremacist group, with the hood replaced with Mickey Mouse ears and a new caption no hate joining the existing racist homophobe moron governor, in which the word governor was struck through. Lawmakers from both parties last week contemplated calling a special session to rebuke LePage, whose term extends through 2018, for the message, in which he called a lawmaker a little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker. That effort collapsed with the two sides unable to agree on the details of how long the special session would last or what its precise objectives were, with Democrats calling for impeachment, further than Republicans were willing to go. I think it was a lot of work but I think a lot of people are pretty upset about how things are going, Falmouth resident Emily Hickey told Maine CBS affiliate WGME as she viewed the mural. Tom Poulin, of Oakland, Maine, said he believed the painting was in poor taste. You can have your personal thoughts about somebody but to say them like that is a little ridiculous, he told WGME. Portland Mayor Ethan Strimling, a Democrat, said on Twitter that he had asked city officials to take down the mural. As much as we are all infuriated by the governors statements, equating his language to the systemic terrorism and murder Grand Wizards inflicted upon African Americans (and Catholics) trivializes the KKK, Strimling said. A spokeswoman for LePage did not immediately respond to a request for comment. LePage has faced a flurry of criticism over the past two weeks for saying that members of minority groups from out of state were responsible for the lions share of the heroin trade in Maine. He drew further criticism after the widely circulated voicemail. ",politicsNews,"September 7, 2016 ",1
Trump raises about $90 million in August," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump raised about $90 million in August in his campaign for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election against Democrat Hillary Clinton, his campaign said on Wednesday.  The fundraising totals, first reported by Fox News, did not include a breakdown of how much of the total the New York real estate mogul contributed to his own campaign. Trump said at a rally on Tuesday that he himself contributed a lot of the money to his campaign in August.  Republican ex-defense secretary Cohen backs Hillary Clinton Live Blog: Mexico's Pena Nieto replaces finance minister after Trump visit Trump campaign reverses ban on credentials for some media outlets Clinton, who raised $143 million in the same time period, has consistently outraised Trump, allowing her to spend more widely on expensive television advertisements.  Clinton has also built a vastly larger campaign payroll, spending millions more than Trump to hire staff around the country that will be the backbone of her efforts to get people to turn out and vote.  In July, Trump took in $80 million.  Trump, a former reality TV star who has never held elected office, has already defied precedent in campaign spending. During the primary, he was outspent by many of his Republican rivals but was able to leverage free media coverage to secure the partys presidential nomination.  But Republican supporters have warned that he may not be able to replicate the winning formula in the general election, when turning out less-engaged voters is a key piece of victory.  Trump did not begin fundraising with intensity until June.  Clinton began August with $58 million, compared to Trump who started the month with $38 million.  ",politicsNews,"September 7, 2016 ",1

'Bridgegate' names can remain secret: U.S. appeals court,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday rejected an effort by news media to force prosecutors in the George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal known as Bridgegate to disclose the names of unindicted co-conspirators. Reversing a lower court ruling, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia found no right of public access under the U.S. Constitutions First Amendment or the common law to a list of people implicated but not criminally charged. The 3-0 decision came one day before jury selection was scheduled to begin in the trial of two former allies of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie who are accused of arranging the September 2013 shutdown of bridge access lanes in Fort Lee, New Jersey, causing several days of gridlock. Public access to judicial documents and court proceedings is a respected tradition and important legal principle, but it has bounds, Circuit Judge Kent Jordan wrote. While it may make sense to release the names at trial, that time is not here yet, he added. Prosecutors accused William Baroni, a former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Bridget Anne Kelly, a former Christie deputy chief of staff, of closing lanes to punish Fort Lees Democratic mayor, Mark Sokolich, for not endorsing the successful re-election of Christie, a Republican. Disclosing the list could have shown whether other Christie allies sought political payback by snarling traffic. Another former Port Authority official, David Wildstein, is cooperating with prosecutors after pleading guilty. Christie has denied involvement, but the scandal helped erode his once-high approval ratings. He ran unsuccessfully this year for the White House. His office had no immediate comment. U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton in Newark had in May ordered disclosing the names of unindicted co-conspirators, but a John Doe on the list appealed, fearing reputational harm. Bruce Rosen, a lawyer for media companies including ABC, the Associated Press and the New York Times, in an email said his clients are disappointed, and no decision on an appeal has been made. Does lawyer, Jenny Kramer, in an email said she was gratified that the appeals court prevented disclosure of highly prejudicial material. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman in New Jersey, who supported Doe, declined to comment. Baroni and Kelly have pleaded not guilty to wire fraud, civil rights deprivation and conspiracy charges, and received the list of names to help prepare for trial. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ",politicsNews,"September 7, 2016 ",1
U.S. lawmakers want moratorium on commercial flights to Cuba,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two leading critics of President Barack Obamas moves toward normal relations with Cuba introduced legislation on Wednesday seeking to temporarily halt commercial flights between the United States and the island because of security concerns. Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, both Cuban-American opponents of Obamas Cuba policy, introduced the Cuban Airport Security Act. The measure would stop commercial flights until after a study of security measures and equipment at airports in Cuba. The U.S. government has granted several U.S. airlines permission to begin scheduled flights to Cuba, opening another chapter in the Obama administrations efforts to improve ties and increase trade and travel with the former Cold War foe. A JetBlue Airways Corp passenger jet flew to Santa Clara, Cuba, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Aug. 31. It was the first scheduled commercial passenger flight from the United States to Cuba in more than half a century. Commercial flights to the capital, Havana, are expected to begin later this year. Obamas Cuba policy sharply divides the U.S. Congress.  Opponents, mostly Republicans but also a few Democrats, say he is moving too quickly to ease restrictions on travel and trade, given continuing human rights violations by its Communist government. Backers say it is time to try another tactic in dealing with Havana after more than half a century with no change under the previous policy. A version of the bill was introduced in the House of Representatives in July. There has been no announcement of when the measure might come up for a vote. ",politicsNews,"September 7, 2016 ",1
"After insult, U.S. and Clinton call for Duterte to show respect"," (Note: Paragraphs 1 and 9 contain strong language that might offend some readers) By Arshad Mohammed and Jeff Mason WASHINGTON/TAMPA (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Tuesday stressed the need for ties with the Philippines to be based on mutual respect, after Manilas new leader raised worries about the future of the key alliance by calling President Barack Obama a son of a bitch. Despite U.S. dismay over Dutertes remarks, current and former U.S. officials played down the impact, saying they did not expect any serious damage to ties at a time of high tensions over Chinas extensive territorial claims in Asia. The State Department said a planned first meeting between Obama and his counterpart Rodrigo Duterte on the sidelines of a regional summit in Laos on Tuesday was canceled because the tone of the Philippine leaders rhetoric raised questions about the chances of productive talks. Words matter, and we want to see an atmosphere that is cordial and open to strong cooperation, State Department spokesman Mark Toner told a regular news briefing in Washington. Clinton, who as secretary of state was an architect of Obamas policy of emphasizing the importance of the Asia Pacific to U.S. interests in the face of a rising China, said Obama was right to cancel the meeting. When the president of the Philippines insulted our president, it was appropriate in a very low-key way to say: sorry, no meeting, she told reporters on her campaign plane. We have a lot of ties between the United States and the Philippines. And I think its very important that we have a relationship, but there has to be a certain level of respect that is expected on both sides, Clinton said. Duterte made the remark about Obama while explaining that he would not be lectured over extrajudicial killings in the war against drugs he has launched since taking over two months ago and which has killed about 2,400 people. He has previously called the pope a son of a whore and the U.S. ambassador a gay son of whore. The Philippines voiced regret for Dutertes comments after Obama canceled a formal bilateral meeting. The White House then said Obama might speak with Duterte informally. Dutertes volatile nature threatens to complicate Washingtons ties with its closest ally in Southeast Asia as it tries to forge a united front in the region in response to Chinas extensive claims in the strategic South China Sea. The Philippines has been central in this effort due to an international court case it brought and won against Beijing.  In March, the United States and the Philippines agreed on five locations for U.S. military facilities in the country under a new security deal. The deal grants Washington increased military presence in its former colony through rotation of ships and planes for humanitarian and maritime security operations.  Asked about Dutertes comments, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said the defense relationship with the Philippines was a strong and longstanding one. Speaking to reporters, Carter also described the Philippines new defense minister, Delfin Lorenzana, as someone who was very knowledgeable about all the things that we do together. An official of the U.S. State Department said government to government relations with Manila remained strong. The areas that we believe we have robust, strong cooperation with them, we are not going to just simply throw that aside. The official noted that Duterte was new to national leadership having served as a city mayor. He is maybe feeling his way into the new job, the official said. Former U.S. officials said China would be pleased by the U.S.-Philippines friction.  Time will tell whether PresidentDuterte steps back from this episode and realizes he needs to recalibrate his choice of words in engaging U.S. leaders, said Amy Searight, a former senior Pentagon official now at Washingtons Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. Evan Medeiros, Obamas former top Asia adviser and now a senior analyst at the Eurasia Group, saw the row as a speed bump, not a road block in U.S.-Philippines ties.  Its unfortunate, but doesnt fundamentally derail the relationship, he said. ",politicsNews,"September 6, 2016 ",1
"Invoking religion, a more disciplined Trump speaks of unity","GREENVILLE, N.C., Va./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump invoked religion, talked of unifying Americans and tried to raise doubts about whether Democratic rival Hillary Clinton can be trusted in a new campaign stump speech unveiled on Tuesday. I will fight for Detroit, for Chicago, for Baltimore, and for every neglected part of this nation  and I will fight to bring us all together as one American people, Trump told a packed rally in Greenville, North Carolina, in a departure from his typical bare-knuckled approach. On the Democratic side, both Clinton and her vice presidential running mate, Tim Kaine, blasted Trump. Clinton focused on Trumps past bankruptcies and his refusal to release his tax records. He clearly has something to hide. We dont know exactly what it is, but were getting better guesses about what it probably is, she said in Tampa, Florida. Kaine, in a national security speech in Wilmington, North Carolina, criticized Trumps business dealings with Russia, the ties between some of his campaign advisers to the country and Trumps suggestion that he hoped Russian hackers could find missing emails from when Clinton was secretary of state. He has openly encouraged Russia to hack his political opponents and commit espionage against his own country, Kaine said. Trump, in a speech on Wednesday in Cleveland, is to lay out a military preparedness plan in which he will call for rescinding mandatory defense spending cuts and embarking on a major military buildup.  The Trump campaign said the candidate will call for big increases in spending for new ships, planes, submarines and training combat troops and bolstering missile defense systems. Trump will also criticize Clinton for military adventurism for her handling of Libya and the Middle East as secretary of state. Trump, buoyed by polls showing him as gaining ground against Clinton, outlined what he would do on his first day as president if elected on Nov. 8, part of a new effort to inject more discipline into his free-wheeling campaign. He said he would suspend the resettlement of Syrian refugees into the United States, start toward repealing and replacing President Barack Obamas signature healthcare plan, and begin the first steps toward building a wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico. Trump, who rarely mentions religion, quoted from a Bible passage he read aloud at a black church in Detroit on Saturday, part of his effort to appeal to African-American voters. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people, under one God, saluting one flag, he added. It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new American future. But Trump was unflinchingly critical of Clinton over the latest disclosures from the Federal Bureau of Investigation about her use of a private email server and destruction of thousands of emails that she and her staff had deemed of a personal nature. At least two of her mobile devices were reported destroyed by a staff using a hammer and BleachBit software to wipe unwanted emails. People who have nothing to hide dont smash phones with hammers. People who have nothing to hide dont bleach their emails or destroy evidence to keep it from being publicly archived as required under federal law, Trump said. Kaine, in his first major policy speech since being tapped as Clintons running mate, drew a contrast between how Trump would approach U.S. relations with Russia and Clintons track record as head of the U.S. State Department from 2009 to 2013, during Obamas first term as president. As head of the State Department, Clinton oversaw hard-nosed negotiations with Russia to reduce nuclear stockpiles and destroy Syrian chemical weapons, while still going toe-to-toe with Putin to protect America and NATO allies, Kaine said. Trump seems to support Russian interests at the expense of American ones, he added. Kaines speech began less than an hour after Trump concluded a campaign stop in Virginia Beach, in Kaines home state of Virginia, where he scoffed at the idea that Clinton would hold any sway over Putins actions.  Putin looks at Hillary Clinton and he laughs. Putin looks at Hillary Clinton and he smiles, Trump said. The back-and-forth occurred as the focus of the U.S. battle for the White House shifted to national security, with both Clinton and Trump set to participate in a televised forum on Wednesday hosted by a veterans group. Trump followed up his Virginia event by meeting with the wives of U.S. military personnel stationed at nearby installations. Setting aside his usual bombast, Trump turned soft-spoken and nodded attentively as the women, some of whom held babies on their laps, described their concerns about the quality of schools and finding jobs. So much of this we can take care of, Trump told them. ",politicsNews,"September 6, 2016 ",1
Democrats launch new push for Obama U.S. Supreme Court nominee,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Supporters of Merrick Garland, President Barack Obamas U.S. Supreme Court selection, on Tuesday launched a new push to persuade the Republican-led Senate to act on the nomination before the Nov. 8 presidential election, but their calls fell on deaf ears. With senators returning to work after a seven-week summer recess, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid called the refusal of Republicans to consider Garlands nomination disgusting and repugnant. Republicans have deadlocked our entire system of justice because of the Republican Senates dysfunction, Reid said. Obamas nomination of the moderate appeals court judge has been pending without action for 174 days, longer than any other Supreme Court nominee in U.S. history. The U.S. Constitution gives the Senate the job of confirming a presidents judicial nominees. In a move with little precedent in American history, Republicans led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have refused to take any action on Obamas nominee, insisting that Obamas successor make the pick. The Senate is returning from the longest recess in nearly half a century, and perhaps the Republican leadership was hoping that Americans had forgotten about the unprecedented obstruction of a Supreme Court nominee, said Senator Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. We Need Nine, a White House-allied group, will hold a news conference in front of the Supreme Court building on Wednesday with Democratic senators and lawyers who previously worked as clerks for Garland. Republicans sounded unconvinced. McConnell has been crystal clear for the last seven months, an aide to the senator said on Tuesday. The next president will select the nominee. The nine-seat court has been one justice short since the February death of long-serving conservative Antonin Scalia. With four liberals and four conservatives now on the bench, an appointment by a Democratic president could end decades of conservative domination on the court. The White House has called Garlands confirmation a top priority for the legislative work period that began on Tuesday and ends in early October.  In remarks last month, Republican Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley indicated he could be persuaded by a large number of senators to take action on Garland in a lame duck session immediately after the election. His panel would hold any confirmation hearings. Some conservatives worry that if Democrat Hillary Clinton defeats Republican Donald Trump in the election, she would nominate someone more liberal than Garland. But in a statement on Tuesday, Grassley reiterated that the next president should choose Justice Scalias replacement and said his meetings with home-state voters during the recess only bolstered the point that Iowans should have the opportunity to have a voice in the direction of the Supreme Court for the next 40 years.

"U.S. companies tout climate policies, fund climate skeptics","BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies that have expressed the most fervent public support for President Barack Obamas environmental agenda are also funding its biggest enemies - the scores of U.S. lawmakers who are climate change skeptics and oppose regulation to combat it, according to a Reuters review of public records. Ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential and congressional elections, the donations from companies including PepsiCo, Dupont, and Google reveal a disconnect between how these companies present themselves to the public on environmental issues, and how they manage their political contributions to support business-friendly policy. (Click here for a graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2bWl9dN) Many companies active in U.S. politics spread their political donations broadly on both sides of the aisle and consider multiple issues when deciding whom to support. But inconsistency between a companys environmental positions and its political giving may point up a need for better oversight, according to Jon Lukomnik, head of the Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute. There really needs to be a process that looks at these issues ... at C-suite and board levels on a periodic basis, Lukomnik said. The Reuters review covered donations made during the 2016 election cycle by the political action committees (PACs) of 30 of the biggest publicly traded U.S. companies that signed Obamas American Business Act on Climate Change Pledge in 2015, a public promise to enact climate-friendly corporate policies and support strong climate change oversight like the global climate accord signed in Paris. The review found that 25 of the 30 companies are funding the campaigns of lawmakers featured on a climate deniers list that was put together by Organizing For Action, a non-profit created by former Obama campaign aides to advocate his agenda. The list includes more than 130 members of Congress, nearly all Republicans, and is a whos who of the biggest opponents of Obamas plan to combat climate change. Some of those on the list dispute the label denier and describe themselves as climate change skeptics. The list includes Republican Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, an energy advisor to presidential candidate Donald Trump who once argued the Earth was cooling not warming, and Republican U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, who last year held up a snowball on the Senate floor as evidence global warming does not exist.  The review found PepsiCo and DuPonts political action committees gave about half or more of the money from their top donations in support of senators and congressmen on the list. That amounted to $56,500 from the Pepsi PACs 29 donations of $2,500 and above, and $40,000 from the DuPont PACs 19 donations of $2,000 and above. Other signatories to the American Business Act on Climate Change Pledge that gave more than a third of their top political contributions to lawmakers on the list include Google, AT&T, GE, Verizon, and Mondelez, according to the review.  Those levels of donations given to climate skeptics are relatively high given that the list covers about a quarter of U.S. Congress members. Officials from PepsiCo, Google, AT&T, and Verizon did not respond to requests for comment. DuPont declined to comment, and Mondelez referred Reuters to the press release announcing its participation in the climate pledge. A GE spokeswoman said the company supports elected officials based on a wide range of issues, but we have consistently been outspoken about the need to address climate change and have investedover $17 billion in cleaner technology R&D over the last 11 years. PepsiCo has also been working to become more energy efficient, and now operates the countrys largest fleet of electric delivery trucks. But it still has a sizeable carbon footprint: It produced some 4.1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2013, down 2 percent from 2012, according to its website. A more recent figure was not available. DuPont, also working to increase its energy efficiency, emitted 16.5 million metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2013. Congressman Cramer, a self-described climate skeptic who opposes Obamas climate agenda but has taken donations from companies that signed the climate pledge, said companies tend to consider issues like tax policy, national security, and regulatory policy when picking who to support - as opposed to a single issue like the environment. He, like other lawmakers featured on the Organizing For Action climate deniers list, said the debate over climate change was not as clear cut as Obamas allies depict it.  It is not a black and white issue, like if you agree with Obama youre enlightened, and if you dont youre in the dark, he said. It is more of a spectrum. A spokeswoman for Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, another lawmaker featured on the list, said he had done more than almost any other member of Congress to increase the use of clean energy sources like wind and biofuels.  But she added he was opposed to Obamas climate change initiatives, like the Clean Power Plan to curb carbon output, because he felt that it could hurt the competitiveness of U.S. businesses globally. Senator Inhofe, who said he doesnt mind the label climate denier, suggested that some companies had signed the American Business Act on Climate Change pledge for superficial reasons. These are competitive companies, and the board might have said Look, right now it might be a popular thing to join this, and theres no downside since were not really committing to anything. That absolutely goes on, he said. The five companies reviewed by Reuters that did not fund opponents to Obamas climate change agenda either had no political action committee, like Apple, or made only a small number of contributions, like Coca Cola.  Lauren Compere, managing director at sustainable investment manager Boston Common Asset Management, said consistency between policy and political giving was becoming increasingly important to environmentally-minded investors. No company should want to be perceived as espousing progressive climate policies on the one hand, while funding climate deniers on the other, she said. ",politicsNews,"September 6, 2016 ",1
Philippines scrambles to soothe tensions after Obama slur,"VIENTIANE (Reuters) - (Note: paragraphs 1, 6 and 19 contain language that may offend some readers) New Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte sought to defuse a row with the United States on Tuesday, voicing regret for calling President Barack Obama a son of a bitch, a comment that prompted Washington to call off a bilateral meeting. The tiff between the two allies overshadowed the opening of a summit of East and Southeast Asian nations in Vientiane, Laos. It also soured Obamas last swing as president through a region he has tried to make a focus of U.S. foreign policy, a strategy widely seen as a response to Chinas economic and military muscle-flexing. Diplomats say strains with longtime ally the Philippines could compound Washingtons difficulties in forging a united front with Southeast Asian partners on the geostrategic jostle with Beijing over the South China Sea. Duterte has bristled repeatedly at criticism over his war on drugs, which has killed about 2,400 people since he took office two months ago, and on Monday said it would be rude for Obama to raise the question of human rights when they met. Such a conversation, Duterte told reporters, would prompt him to curse at Obama, using a Filipino phrase putang ina which can mean son of a bitch or son of a whore. He has previously used the epithet against Pope Francis, although he later apologized, and the U.S. ambassador to the Philippines. After Washington called off Tuesdays bilateral meeting between Obama and Duterte in response to his latest comment, the Philippines issued two statements expressing regret and also briefed reporters. President Duterte explained that the press reports that President Obama would lecture him on extrajudicial killings led to his strong comments, which in turn elicited concern, the Philippines government said in a statement. He regrets that his remarks to the press have caused much controversy, it added. He expressed his deep regard and affinity for President Obama and for the enduring partnership between our nations. Obamas deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, said the focus on Dutertes comments leading into the summit had not created a constructive environment for a bilateral meeting. All of the attention frankly was on those comments, and therefore not on the very substantive agenda that we have with the Philippines, he told reporters. Officials from both countries said there would be no formal meeting rescheduled in Laos but a short conversation between the two presidents was possible.  Instead of the Duterte meeting, Obama held talks with South Korean President Park Geun-hye, a day after North Korea fired three medium-range missiles into the sea. He urged a full implementation of sanctions against North Korea, adding that the missile test demonstrated the threat that Pyongyang posed. Obama is also likely to hold an unscheduled meeting in Laos with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to discuss North Korea, Rhodes said. He said Washington needed to maintain a sense of urgency within the international community on sanctions against Pyongyang.  Obama, the first sitting U.S. president to visit Laos, said on Tuesday he wanted to address the legacy of U.S. bombing during the Vietnam War. He announced that Washington would provide an additional $90 million over three years to help clear unexploded ordnance, which has killed or wounded over 20,000 people.  But the unusually open tensions between the United States and the Philippines, its former colony, threaten to overshadow the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and East Asia Summits in Laos, which run until Thursday. The 10-member ASEAN will also meet leaders of other regional powers: China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, India, Russia and the United States. Duterte won the presidency in May after promising to suppress crime and wipe out the illegal drug trade in a country where the number of methamphetamine users is estimated to be at least 1.3 million in a population of 100 million.  About 900 people linked to drugs have been killed in police operations since July 1 and a further 1,500 have been classified as deaths under investigation, a term human rights activists in the Philippines say is a euphemism for extrajudicial killings. Duterte has poured scorn on critics of his uncompromising campaign, usually larding it with curses.  He lambasted the United Nations after it criticized the surge in killings and he turned down a meeting with U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon at the Laos summit. He has accused a senator heading an inquiry into the killings of getting payoffs from drug lords. Manila has been aligned with the United States in its dispute with China over the South China Sea, in which Washington blames Beijing for militarizing a vital global trade route and jeopardizing freedom of movement at sea and in the air. China rejects those accusations and accuses the United States of ratcheting up tensions unnecessarily. China claims most of the South China Sea, through which more than $5 trillion of trade moves annually. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have rival claims. An arbitration court in The Hague in July invalidated Chinas territorial claims after a case was brought by the Philippines, a ruling Beijing refuses to recognize. Duterte said last month he expected all ASEAN members to support the arbitration courts ruling, but that the Philippines would not raise the issue in Laos. ",politicsNews,"September 5, 2016 ",1
Clinton slams Trump for commenting on Fed policies,"TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton criticized Republican rival Donald Trump on Tuesday for making comments about the Federal Reserves monetary policies, which she said should be off-limits for U.S. presidents and presidential candidates. You should not be commenting on Fed actions when you are either running for president or you are president, Clinton told reporters on her campaign plane. Words have consequences. Words move markets. Words can be misinterpreted. Trump, who has previously accused the U.S. central bank of keeping interest rates low to help Democratic President Barack Obama, said on Monday that interest rates should change. Theyre keeping the rates down so that everything else doesnt go down, Trump said in response to a reporters request to address a potential rate hike by the Federal Reserve in September. We have a very false economy. Clinton criticized the New York real estate magnate in her second press conference in as many days. He should not be trying to talk up or talk down the economy, and he should not be adding the Fed to his long list of institutions and individuals that he is maligning and otherwise attacking, she said. Clinton, a former U.S. senator from New York and secretary of state, also said that daughter Chelsea Clintons involvement in the Clinton Foundation charity will be decided after the Nov. 8 election. These issues will be decided after the election. And we will decide the appropriate way forward, she said. Earlier, she told ABC News that her husband, former President Bill Clinton, should not have to step down before the election from his position at the foundation. I dont think there are conflicts of interest, Clinton said in the ABC interview. I know that thats what has been alleged and never proven. But nevertheless, I take it seriously. Her use of a private email server while secretary of state and questions about improper influence involving donors to the Clinton Foundation have been thorny topics for Clinton as the presidential campaign headed into its final months. Clinton dismissed the latest call for a new investigation into her email practices. The FBI resolved all of this. Their report answered all the questions, she said. Clinton also brushed off polls that show the race tightening between her and Trump. Were sticking with our strategy. We feel very good about where we are. But were not taking anything for granted, she said. ",politicsNews,"September 6, 2016 ",1

President Rodrigo Duterte called Obama a son of a bitch and said he would not be lectured over extrajudicial killings in the Philippines drug war. Duterte later voiced regret for his language. The two had been scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit in Laos but Obama canceled the meeting. ",politicsNews,"September 6, 2016 ",1
No. 2 House Democrat opposes temporary gov't spending bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, on Tuesday said he opposed any temporary spending bill for the federal government that lasted beyond December. Members of the U.S. Congress, who returned to Washington after a summer recess, must pass a spending bill before the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30 or risk a government shutdown. Some conservative Republicans have said they want a temporary spending bill that extends into 2017. ",politicsNews,"September 6, 2016 ",1
Republicans' Congress lull could impede a Clinton presidency,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in Congress are planning a light legislative agenda as they return from their long summer break on Tuesday, a strategy some say is designed in part to bog down Hillary Clinton if she becomes president.  It is not uncommon for the Congress to take it slow in an election year and legislative delays could work in Republicans favor if their nominee Donald Trump takes the White House in November. But the strategy will also pay dividends if it is Clinton who takes office on Jan. 20. She will be forced to deal with old baggage rather than focus on her agenda of infrastructure investments and immigration and Wall Street reforms. If Hillary wins, we force her to waste time, resources, momentum, early good will and political capital - all on cleanup duty, said a senior aide to one Republican senator. If all goes as expected this autumn, a U.S. Supreme Court seat, vacant since Feb. 13, will remain unfilled until sometime next year. A sweeping Pacific free-trade deal negotiated by President Barack Obama will be on hold, if not doomed. And if many conservative Republicans get their way, government agencies will run on stop-gap funding from Oct. 1 until sometime in February or March. That means that the next president would have to negotiate a longer-term deal or face the prospect of government shutdowns in the early days of a new administration. Senior congressional aides have told Reuters their agenda for the coming months include bills to keep the government funded, combat the spreading Zika virus and renewing laws guarding the nations water resources. Other items would help the majority Republicans score political points with key constituencies before the November elections, even though they have no chance of becoming law. These include scolding the Obama administration for a $400 million payment to Iran in January after Tehran released American prisoners, anti-abortion measures and, once again, proposals to repeal Obamas landmark healthcare law. Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist and former aide to Republican leaders in Congress, acknowledged that public opinion polling is trending in Clintons direction. If Clinton wins, Bonjean added, The whole mindset (among Republican leaders in Congress) would shift to taking care of the most important business to help Republicans and unloading the more difficult, tense issues for a Clinton administration to deal with. Clinton has maintained a lead in most polls since Republican and Democratic conventions, but some surveys showed that lead narrowing. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sept. 2 showed Trump effectively pulling even with the Democratic nominee. Yet one veteran Republican congressional aide said more and more Republicans in Congress brace for the White House to stay in Democratic hands for the next four years, even if their party manages to maintain control of Congress. Trumps trouble in appealing to important groups of voters, such as Hispanics, African-Americans and Asians, and self-inflicted wounds have made it pretty clear hes highly unlikely to get there, he said. Leaving the Supreme Court nomination and other high-profile disagreements for 2017 does bog down a new administration, no question about it, the aide said. Some election years mean a slow autumn in Congress, but this is not always the case. In 2012 for example, lawmakers dramatically labored all the way through New Years Eve addressing a fiscal cliff of expiring tax and spending laws.  Not all of the delays in passing legislation are purely on Republican shoulders though. While Trump has blasted free-trade deals, leading Democrats, including Clinton, also have criticized Obamas Trans-Pacific Partnership pact that would create a free-trade zone ranging from Japan to Chile. Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, downplayed the challenges Clinton might face early on. She knows how to deal with Congress. Shes been there, he said referring to Clintons years as a senator representing New York. Besides, he added, if Trump loses, Republicans will be busy dealing with their own problems.  Theyll have to think seriously about how they got themselves in the trouble that theyre in. ",politicsNews,"September 6, 2016 ",1
Clinton rejects Mexico invitation after Trump's diplomatic ruckus,"(Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said on Monday she will not accept an invitation from Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto for a visit after rival Donald Trump created what she called a diplomatic incident in his foray there. In a written excerpt from an interview with ABC News that will air Tuesday morning, Clinton simply said no when asked if she would travel to Mexico before the election on Nov. 8, without elaborating further. Her campaign later confirmed her decision. We understand and respect her decision to propose the time to hold a meeting, said Mexican Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu in a tweet, adding that contact with Clintons campaign was ongoing. Pena Nieto extended invitations to both candidates last month, and Trump flew to Mexico City last Wednesday for a meeting that appeared to be friendly but later revealed deep tensions. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has been highly critical of Mexico, saying the country sends rapists and drug dealers to the United States. He has called for a wall to be built on the border that would be paid for by Mexico.  Trump said at a joint news conference with Pena Nieto that they did not discuss who would pay for the wall. Pena Nieto remained silent on the issue at the event, but said later on Twitter that he made it clear Mexico would not pay for the wall. He came out saying one thing and the Mexican president contradicted him almost immediately, Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, said in the ABC interview. He didnt raise it, so he did choke. He didnt know how to even communicate effectively with a head of state. And I think thats a pretty clear outcome from that trip, she added.    ",politicsNews,"September 6, 2016 ",1

U.S. gives Laos extra $90 million to help clear unexploded ordnance,"VIENTIANE (Reuters) - The United States announced on Tuesday it would provide an additional $90 million over the next three years to help Laos, heavily bombed during the Vietnam War, clear unexploded ordnance that has killed or injured more than 20,000 people. The figure announced during President Barack Obamas first visit to Laos is close to the $100 million the United States has spent in the past 20 years on clearing its UXO in Laos. From 1964 to 1973, U.S. warplanes dropped more than 270 million cluster munitions on the communist country, one-third of which did not explode, the Lao National Regulatory Authority for UXO says. Obama became the first U.S. president to visit Laos when he arrived in the once-isolated country on Monday to attend two regional summits, half a century after Americas secret war left Laos with the unfortunate distinction of being the most heavily bombed country, per capita, in history. The White House said in a statement U.S. programs in Laos had helped slash UXO casualties from 300 to less than 50 a year and the additional funding would be used for a comprehensive UXO survey of Laos and for continued clearing operations. The United States is helping Laos clear unexploded ordnance, which poses a threat to people and hampers economic development, it said. The package would help support UXO victims needing rehabilitation, including orthotics and prosthetics, it added. Obama, in a speech on Tuesday in the capital, Vientiane, addressed the secret war. As a result of that conflict many people fled or were driven from their homes, Obama said. At the time America did not acknowledge its role. I believe the United States has a moral obligation to help Laos heal. UXO remains a stubborn problem in the region and experts say it could take decades to clear landmines and bombs in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, which were beset by conflicts in the 1960s and 1970s, and in Cambodias case, in the 1980s and 1990s too. In the central Lao province of Xieng Khouang, the area most heavily bombed by U.S. aircraft during the war in neighboring Vietnam, there is a trail of devastation. About 80 percent of the people of landlocked Laos rely on agriculture, but some of it is simply too dangerous to farm. Approximately a quarter of its villages are contaminated with unexploded ordnance, says the British-based Mines Advisory Group, which helps find and destroy the bombs. On Wednesday, Obama is expected to visit an organization in Vientiane that works with those disabled by unexploded ordnance, the Cooperative Orthotic and Prosthetic Enterprise Visitor Center.

U.S. conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly dead at 92,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Phyllis Schlafly, who became a founding mother of the modern U.S. conservative movement by battling feminists in the 1970s and working tirelessly to defeat the Equal Rights Amendment, died on Monday at the age of 92, her Eagle Forum group said. Schlafly, who lived in the St. Louis suburb of Ladue, Missouri, died at her home in the presence of her family, Eagle Forum said in a statement. The cause of death was not given. She was still a conservative force and popular speaker in her 90s, endorsing Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 and praising his policy on immigration. She was a delegate to the Republicans convention in Cleveland. Trump said in a statement that he spoke with Schlafly a few weeks ago by telephone and she sounded as resilient as ever ... She was a patriot, a champion for women, and a symbol of strength. Schlafly once called feminists a bunch of bitter women seeking a constitutional cure for their personal problems, Time said, while insisting that women find their greatest fulfillment at home with their family. Her political ardor did not fade with age and in 2014, as President Barack Obama pushed for pay equity for women, Schlafly sparked controversy with a column for the Christian Post saying a mans paycheck comes first. The pay gap between men and women is not all bad because it helps to promote and sustain marriages, she said. ... The best way to improve economic prospects for women is to improve job prospects for the men in their lives, even if that means increasing the so-called pay gap. Schlafly promoted traditional family values and once told a reporter that she always listed her occupation as mother when filling out applications. But she was hardly a typical stay-at-home housewife/mother. Shortly after marrying lawyer Fred Schlafly in 1949, she became active in Republican Party politics in Alton, Illinois, and ran unsuccessfully for Congress twice. She would go on to found the Eagle Forum grass-roots conservative group, write a newspaper column and newsletter and author some 20 books. Her crowning achievement was crusading to prevent the Equal Rights Amendment from being added to the U.S. Constitution and it made Schlafly a leader in the modern American conservative movement. Phyllis Schlafly courageously and single-handedly took on the issue of the Equal Rights Amendment when no one else in the country was opposing it, said James C. Dobson, chairman and founder of Focus on the Family. In so doing, she essentially launched the pro-family, pro-life movement. Biographer Donald T. Critchlow said defeating the ERA helped usher in a conservative era in American politics and boosted Ronald Reagan to the presidency. In her decade-long fight against the ERA, Schlafly traveled across the country to speak at rallies and persuade state legislators not to approve the ERA.  Along the way she often debated feminist writer Betty Freidan, who called Schlafly a traitor to her sex and once told her: Id like to burn you at the stake. The intention of the ERA was to ensure women were treated the same as men under state and federal laws. Schlaflys attack on the proposed amendment was based on the premise that the rights of women already were well protected by the U.S. Constitution. She said the ERA actually would erode womens standing, leading to homosexual marriages, women in combat, government-funded abortions and loss of alimony. In 1972 she started the Eagle Forum, now located in Clayton, Missouri, along with Stop ERA, bringing in legions of supporters who had been regarded as non-political housewives. In a 1978 appearance at the Illinois capitol she was accompanied by backers bearing loaves of home-made bread. Described by Time magazine as feminine but forceful and with her hair always carefully styled, Schlafly said she attended 41 state hearings to testify against the Equal Rights Amendment. When the ERAs ratification deadline expired in 1982, having been approved by only 35 of the 38 states needed, Schlafly threw a party in Washington. Phyllis Stewart was born Aug. 15, 1924, in St. Louis and grew up in a home she described as Republican but not activist. She put herself through Washington University by firing weapons as an ammunition factory tester and later earned a masters degree in political science from Radcliffe. In 1978 she graduated from Washington Universitys law school. The left attacked Schlafly for promoting domestic life to her supporters while spending so much time pursuing her ambitious political agenda. She responded by saying she never told women they should not work. I simply didnt believe we needed a constitutional amendment to protect womens rights, Schlafly told the New York Times. Schlafly first became a political presence with her 1964 self-published book A Choice, Not an Echo, which championed the conservative politics of Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater. Schlafly also built a reputation as a strident anti-Communist and opponent of arms control treaties. After the ERAs defeat, she continued to preach conservative causes such as limited government, anti-abortion laws, traditional education, strong defense and keeping out illegal immigrants. She frequently criticized immigration reform and the Obama administration and wrote more than 25 books. Schlafly also was a critic of gay rights, which proved to be a sensitive topic in 1992 when the oldest of her six children, John, who worked for the Eagle Forum, acknowledged he was homosexual. Schlaflys husband Fred died in 1993. She is survived by six children, 16 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, Eagle Forum said. ",politicsNews,"September 6, 2016 ",1
"Trump, Clinton court Ohio as White House race enters final 2 months","CANFIELD, Ohio/CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton opened a final two-month sprint to the Nov. 8 election on Monday with the Republican presidential nominee suddenly looking stronger as he and his Democratic rival took their bitter fight to Ohio. Both Trump and Clinton made overtures to a news media that each candidate sees as often hostile to them, talking to reporters on their private planes. Clintons session with reporters was her first news conference since last December. After eating a gyro at a diner in the Cleveland area, Trump rallied thousands of cheering supporters at a county fair in Canfield, and Clinton visited a brewery in Cleveland. For a time, their planes were parked about 200 yards apart at the Cleveland airport, a sign of Ohios importance in the election. Ohio is considered one of four swing states - those that are not clearly in the Democratic or Republican camp - that could prove decisive in the Electoral College vote that will ultimately determine the winner. The other swing states are Florida, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Trump was buoyed by more polls showing him in a competitive position. The latest Reuters-Ipsos poll showed Trump with 40 percent support vs 39 percent for Clinton, effectively ending Clintons bump up in the polls after the Democratic nominating convention. Other polls showed Clintons lead had shrunk. I think weve had a great month, Trump said. Clinton remained in a strong position to win the White House race, but Trump and his team cited his growing strength in opinion polls nationally and in several states where the election is likely to be decided to argue that his message is breaking through to voters. Clinton, who emerged into the public eye after days of raising money from wealthy donors behind closed doors, said she always knew the race would be close. Were just going as hard and fast as we possibly can to be organized for turning out the vote, because weve always thought this was going to be hard, and thats why, you know, Im not worried, Im just working, she said. Trump, shaking his fist triumphantly, plunged into a crowd at the Mahoning County Fair where supporters had built a replica of the wall that the Republican nominee has pledged to build along the U.S.-Mexico border.  This has been an unbelievable reception! Trump said after maneuvering through a crowd of people who shouted his name, against a backdrop of food stands offering fare ranging from chicken on a stick to Italian sausages, fudge and fresh corn. Inviting reporters onto his plane for the first time since accepting the Republican presidential nomination, Trump said his focus going forward will be on how to create jobs for middle-class Americans. He has spent most of the past two weeks trying to clarify his position on illegal immigration, first flirting with a softening, then reinforcing his hardline approach, and then, on his plane, saying undocumented people might ultimately get on a path to a legal status once border enforcement steps are taken. Im all about the jobs now, he said, saying his position on the immigration issue was now well known. He also pledged to participate in all three televised presidential debates, ending speculation that he might sit out one or more if he was not happy with the format. His first face-off with Clinton is at Hofstra University in New York state on Sept. 26. Clinton made her stop at a brewery in Cleveland before heading to a nearby Labor Day parade and rally, where she tested a new jab at her opponent: Friends dont let friends vote for Trump.  The Labor Day holiday traditionally kicks off the last stretch of campaigning ahead of the November election. Speaking to reporters on her new campaign plane, she took credit for Trumps overture to the news media. Clinton, buffeted by controversy over her use of a private email server as U.S. secretary of state, has been criticized by Republicans and the news media for months for failing to hold a news conference. I heard now that weve got this great plane, that Donald Trump actually invited his press on his plane where Im told he even answered a few questions, said Clinton. Trumps rebound from a series of self-inflicted wounds follows the hiring of a new campaign management team, and the Republican nominee is showing more discipline on the stump. Trump has been helped by what his campaign said was a positive week last week, highlighted by a quick trip to Mexico, appearing side by side with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, and a visit to a black church in Detroit. But an immigration speech that Trump gave following his trip to Mexico drew criticism from some of his Hispanic supporters, and several backers advising him on the issue decided to part ways with his campaign. Trump aide Jason Miller said rising poll numbers showed that the campaign was moving in the right direction. The trend lines are the important thing to point to, Miller told Reuters. The problem that Clinton has is there is no positive information flow for her campaign. Clinton, who was President Barack Obamas first-term secretary of state, appeared at few public campaign events during the latter half of August, instead raising funds at high-dollar events in the East Coast vacation spots of Marthas Vineyard and the Hamptons, and with celebrities in Los Angeles and high-tech leaders in Silicon Valley. Clintons campaign announced that it had raised $143 million in August for her presidential bid and the Democratic Party. Clinton is again on the defensive over her use of a private email server and possible conflicts of interest with her family foundation while secretary of state, which have caused unease for some voters. But experts still see the Democratic nominee as the odds-on favorite to win the presidency. ",politicsNews,"September 5, 2016 ",1
Puerto Rico debt fix unlikely to resemble Detroit's,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The federal appointees tapped to help map Puerto Ricos economic future are technocrats more than political actors, and that could make the U.S. territorys fiscal turnaround look more like a corporate restructuring than a politically charged municipal bankruptcy in the vein of Detroit.  The law known as PROMESA, which created the board when it passed the U.S. Congress in June with bipartisan support, envisioned a pragmatic solution for an island combating $70 billion in debt, 45 percent poverty and a brain drain as residents bolt in droves for the mainland United States. Its members, four Republicans and three Democrats appointed last week, were chosen by Republican and Democratic lawmakers and President Barack Obama. The board has broad powers to help stabilize the islands economy, from investigating Puerto Ricos government to working with that government on projects to spur economic growth. It must also approve the islands annual budgets, and will eventually facilitate debt-restructuring talks with creditors. In the latter endeavor, it will have to navigate a minefield of competing interests.  The island has 18 separate debt issuers, backed by different revenues streams, as well as $18 billion in so-called general obligation debt backed by the full faith and credit of the territorys government. While that promise is legally weak in a bankruptcy setting, it is a sacrosanct pledge in municipal debt markets. Holders of all that debt will jockey for payouts against government vendors and beneficiaries of the islands public pensions, which have less than $2 billion in assets to cover some $45 billion in liabilities.   Detroits bankruptcy, which ended in December 2014, treated city pensions much better than its outstanding bonds, which were largely insured. Some Puerto Rico creditors, still suffering Detroit flashbacks, feared Puerto Rico could look similar - especially since Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla has pushed big haircuts and railed against the idea of reducing government services. But the makeup of the Puerto Rico board has offered some reassurance, said Nader Tavakoli, chief executive officer of Ambac, which insures $2.2 billion of Puerto Rican bonds and also insured some of Detroits bonds. These board members are technocrats, and it gives us confidence that this is not going to be overly politicized, he said. Deal makers also feature prominently, with an ex-bankruptcy judge, a banker and a hedge fund operator in the mix.  Republicans, generally seen as creditor-friendly, nominated a bankruptcy academic who favors restructuring the islands debt, David Skeel. And Democrats nominated a banker, Jose Ramon Gonzalez, and a Democratic finance expert in Ana Matosantos who directed Californias budget under former Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Experts see the group as likely to push a solution that sees all sides share a burden, a typical approach for companies restructuring under Chapter 11. There are no ideologues in the group, said Keefe Bruyette & Woods analyst Chas Tyson.     That does not mean there are not drawbacks. For one, the board will have to navigate a testy local political climate with residents who largely revile a panel they see as an extension of colonial rule. Island voters broadly unhappy with the Garcia Padilla administration in November will elect a new governor as well as members of the legislature and scores of mayors. There are still politics here, said veteran bankruptcy attorney Richard Levin, who is following the situation. The governor and legislature retain some authority.  For Height Securities analyst Daniel Hanson, the board is short on expertise in economic development. Any real solution for Puerto Rico requires fundamental economic changes, including at its underperforming education department, and its unclear whether the board can facilitate such change. But from a financial perspective, at least, the board seems less inclined to promote a political agenda than figure out a collaborative fix and then get out, said Matt Fabian, partner at Municipal Market Analytics.  The board is not being installed to fight with Puerto Ricans or to impose some kind of federal view, Fabian said. They just want these troubles to be fixed. ",politicsNews,"September 5, 2016 ",1
Trump allies falsely link Reuters to claim Detroit video feed was cut short,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Conservative commentators on Sunday mistakenly accused Reuters of pulling the plug on the final moments of broadcast coverage of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps appearance at a black church this weekend. Reuters said it had no role in filming the Trump event. CBS News filmed on behalf of a pool of media companies and discontinued the feed in the final moments of Trumps appearance because of the schedule set by the campaign, according to a CBS producer involved. The Detroit Trump footage being circulated on Twitter and elsewhere was not filmed by Reuters, Abbe Serphos, Reuters global head of communications, said in a statement. Despite having no involvement in filming the Saturday event, Reuters was targeted for criticism by commentators including Ann Coulter. They were apparently under the false impression that Reuters had ordered its camera operator to shut down as Trump was receiving a blessing from the pastor. Sopan Deb, a CBS journalist who was the pool producer for the event at the Detroit church, said the decision to cut off the video feed was made because Trump campaign staffers were hurrying reporters into a waiting motorcade. I was the pool producer, Deb said in a tweet. We were forced to pack up our cameras and leave during this. CBS News and the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday. Deb could not be reached for further comment beyond his remarks on Twitter. Coulter could not be reached. The sudden controversy was fanned by social media and came on the holiday weekend that traditionally marks the start of major campaigning for the Nov. 8 election. It followed Trumps visit to a largely black church in Detroit on Saturday, where he told the crowd his economic agenda would create jobs and educational opportunity for African-American voters as part of what he called a civil rights agenda for our time. At the end of the nearly hour-long Saturday morning service at the Great Faith Ministries church, Bishop Wayne T. Jackson draped a prayer shawl over Trump to applause from the crowd in the church. I have prayed over this personally, and I have fasted over it, Jackson said. Shortly after Trump accepted the shawl, the pool feed used by broadcast networks was cut off as reporters prepared to move to the next campaign event. How convenient that at one of the compelling moments(the) satellite feed dropped, conservative radio talk show host Laura Ingraham said on Twitter. Deb, the CBS reporter, said the suggestion of bias was totally inaccurate. In a tweet responding to Ingraham, he said: If you want to make this an issue, please take it up with the campaign. We tried to stay and shoot this whole thing.  Ingraham could not be immediately reached for comment. In a point of contention with journalists, Trump staffers have sometimes told reporters traveling with the candidate they need to leave events before Trump if they want to avoid risking their spot in the group of reporters traveling in the motorcade with the candidate. A video posted on a website affiliated with conservative radio show host Alex Jones claimed to capture a difference of opinion between the camera operator and a producer on site about whether to continue filming the Trump event on Saturday. Before the video cuts, one person can be heard to say, Im shooting this, and then, almost inaudibly, Ill take a demotion. A second voice says Shut it and then blackout, the site said. Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the offstage audio. Reuters obtained the footage from third-party providers and the voices heard on the video are not Reuters staff or contractors, Serphos said. Trump has criticized media organizations including the Washington Post, the New York Times, CNN and others for what he has claimed are biases in their coverage of his campaign. On the day of his visit to the Detroit church, Trump lashed out at CNN. Great visit to Detroit church, fantastic reception, and all CNN talks about is a small protest outside, Trump said in a tweet.

Factbox: Facts about conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly died on Monday at 92. Following are some facts about her:  * Schlafly said she tirelessly fought against the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution on the grounds that women were already fully protected and that the amendment  would erode womens standing, leading to homosexual marriages, women in combat, government-funded abortions and loss of alimony. She threw a party in Washington in 1982 to celebrate when the ERA proposal died, having missed its ratification deadline with approval from only 35 of the 38 required states. * While attending Washington University in St. Louis during World War Two, Schlafly worked the night shift at an ordnance plant, firing rifles and machine guns as an ammunition tester. * Schlafly often debated feminist leader Betty Friedan, who called her a traitor to her sex and said shed like to burn her at the stake. Schlafly said Friedan was always very ugly to deal with and debate and made it clear that she hated me. * Schlafly was a consistent foe of gay rights even though her oldest child, John, who worked for her Eagle Forum, acknowledged he was a homosexual in 1992. Its not a problem for anybody but the press, she said, adding that John is not a proponent of gay marriage. * Among the decorations in Schlaflys office were a chunk of the Berlin Wall, a Doonesbury cartoon mocking her and a necktie from Ronald Reagan, who was her favorite president in her lifetime. * Schlafly wrote some 20 books, including Feminist Fantasies, The Supremacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It, Who Will Rock the Cradle?: The Battle for Control of Child Care in America, Pornographys Victims, Child Abuse in the Classroom and Kissinger on the Couch.

Trump raises possibility of eventual legal status for illegal immigrants,"YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (Reuters) - In a new twist to his immigration proposals, U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump held out the possibility of legal status for millions of illegal immigrants, but only after many other border enforcement steps are taken. Trump, in remarks to a small group of reporters whom he invited on his plane for the first time since accepting his partys nomination, said parts of his hardline immigration speech last week in Phoenix had been misinterpreted and that he had in fact softened his position to some extent. The New York businessman said that before considering how to deal with millions of illegal immigrants who are obeying U.S. laws and contributing to American society, he first wants to evict criminal elements like drug smugglers and build a border wall. Any illegal immigrants who want to gain citizenship will have to first return to their home countries first and get in line behind legal applicants, he said. But for those who stay behind, Trump said their cases would be considered at some undefined point. Asked about a potential legal status for this group, Trump did not rule it out. Were going to make that decision into the future. That decision will be made, he said. The first thing will be to get the bad elements out, the gang members, get em all out. We secure the border. We stop the drugs from coming in, because the drugs are pouring in ... Were going to build the wall. We need the wall to stop the drugs. Such a piecemeal approach has been pushed by Republican congressional leaders over the years because it is extremely hard to get a comprehensive immigration reform bill through the U.S. Congress. Trump has struggled to strike the right tone on how he would take on illegal immigration if elected on Nov. 8. After flirting with a softer tone, he stuck to his hardline position in Phoenix last week, saying that anyone in the United States illegally would be subject to deportation. Trump, seated with vice presidential running mate Mike Pence in tan leather seats aboard his private jet, was relaxed for a session with reporters of more than a half hour, clearly feeling better about his campaign after polls showed him closing the gap with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Talking about his recent effort to appeal to African-American voters, Trump was asked if it was difficult to attract black voters since he has raised doubts about whether Democratic President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Trump waved off the question, saying it was an issue he did not want to get into anymore because reporters would seize on it. In 2011 while under fire from Trump, Obama produced his long-form birth certificate to prove that he was, indeed, born in Hawaii. I dont talk about it because if I talk about that, your whole thing will be about that, Trump said. So I dont talk about it. He said his focus for the final two months of the campaign will be mostly about how to create jobs for struggling middle-class Americans.Im all about the jobs now, he said. Trump also pledged to participate in all three presidential debates, saying he considered it an important part of being a candidate. He also said he was fine with the moderators announced last week.

Clinton voices concern about Russian interference in election,"HAMPTON, Ill. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Monday expressed concern about credible reports of Russian interference in the U.S. election and accused Donald Trump of being fixated on dictators including Russias Vladimir Putin. Taking questions from reporters for more than 20 minutes on her campaign plane, Clinton said both Democrats and Republicans should be concerned about Russias behavior. The fact that our intelligence professionals are now studying this and taking it seriously raises some grave questions about potential Russian interference with our electoral process, Clinton said. We are facing a very serious concern. Weve never had a foreign adversarial power be already involved in our electoral process. ... Weve never had the nominee of one of our major parties urging the Russians to hack more, she said. Trump, the Republican nominee, has praised Putin, the president of Russia, and has called on Moscow to dig up tens of thousands of missing emails from Clintons time as head of the U.S. State Department. He later said his comments were meant to be sarcastic. Clinton has previously tied Russian intelligence services to the cyber hack on the Democratic National Committee.  Asked on Monday if she believed the Russian government was trying to help elect her opponent, Clinton paused. I often quote a great saying that I learned from living in Arkansas for many years: If you find a turtle on a fencepost it didnt get there by itself, she said. I think its quite intriguing that this activity has happened around the time Trump became the nominee. Clinton, a former secretary of state and a former first lady, has drawn criticism for not holding regular press conferences. On Monday she took questions on an array of topics for more than 20 minutes. Clinton dismissed concerns about her health as one of many conspiracy theories that were lobbed against her. She blamed seasonal allergies for a sustained coughing fit at an earlier event in Ohio. During the question and answer session on her plane, she also had to step away because of persistent coughing. Clinton, whose use of a private email account during her time as secretary of state has dogged her 2016  presidential campaign, said she understood and took classification seriously when she was President Barack Obamas top diplomat. Clinton said that the attacks on her familys foundation were not rooted in fact and sidestepped a question on whether her daughter, Chelsea, should step down from the foundations leadership if she is elected in November.

Clinton says 'conspiracy theories' about her health not a concern,"(Reuters) - Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Partys presidential nominee, on Monday said that she was not distracted by rumors of ill health and that attacks on the Clinton Foundation were not rooted in fact.

Trump says U.S. interest rates must change as Fed weighs rate hike,"YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has previously accused the Federal Reserve of keeping interest rates low to help President Barack Obama, said on Monday that the U.S. central bank has created a false economy and that interest rates should change. Theyre keeping the rates down so that everything else doesnt go down, Trump said in response to a reporters request to address a potential rate hike by the Federal Reserve in September. We have a very false economy, he said. At some point the rates are going to have to change, Trump, who was campaigning in Ohio on Monday, added. The only thing that is strong is the artificial stock market, he said. Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last month that the U.S. central bank was getting closer to raising interest rates, possibly as early as September, saying that the Fed sees the economy as close to meeting its goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The Fed raised interest rates last December for the first time in nearly a decade, and at that time projected four more hikes in 2016. The Fed later scaled back that projection to two rate hikes this year in the wake of a slowdown in global growth and continued financial market volatility. Trump, during the primary campaign, as he took on 16 Republican rivals, had called Yellens tenure highly political and said the Fed should raise interest rates but would not do so for political reasons. The Fed has been a target of some conservative critics in the U.S. Congress, who say the bank risked sparking inflation with its easy monetary policies in response to the global financial crisis. Fed officials say their independence is critical to making sound policy decisions. ",politicsNews,"September 5, 2016 ",1
Israeli Trump supporters open campaign office in West Bank,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli supporters of U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump have opened a campaign office in the occupied West Bank, saying they hope to get as many American expatriates as possible to cast an absentee ballot for their candidate. There are about 300,000 U.S. citizens in Israel, according to the non-profit group Republican Overseas Israel, which opened the office in the Jewish settlement Karnei Shomron on Monday. It estimates as many as 80,000 of them live in the West Bank, though it is not clear how many are eligible voters. The initiative has no official ties to the Trump campaign or the Republican National Committee (RNC), and the Israeli group opened the West Bank office, and a handful of others throughout Israel, with its own funds, said co-chairman Marc Zell. We are however in close coordination with the Trump campaign and RNC to the extent that its feasible, said Zell. A poll of Jewish Israelis conducted in May found 40 percent of respondents backed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and 31 percent supported Trump. The poll did not specify whether those who responded were eligible to vote in the U.S. election. Trump has accused the administration of President Barack Obama of lacklustre support for Israel. He has also rejected last years nuclear deal with Iran, Israels arch-foe, and has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. The new office in the West Bank is not staffed full-time but will be used as a logistical jumping-off point for outreach activity, Zell said. Israel captured the West Bank, land where Palestinians hope to establish an independent state, in the 1967 Middle East war. Most countries view Israeli settlements built there as illegal and an obstacle for peace. Israel rejects this, saying Jews have been living in the territory for thousands of years.

Clinton's classified email errors due to 'improper labeling:' Kaine,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine on Sunday defended Hillary Clinton against criticism over her handling of classified information as secretary of state, saying she was unaware of the sensitivity of some information she exchanged over email because it had been improperly labeled. In July, the Federal Bureau of Investigation rebuked Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, for her use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, saying she was extremely careless in her handling of classified information. According to records released by the FBI on Friday, Clinton told the bureaus investigators in a July interview that she could not recall getting any briefings on how to handle classified information or comply with laws governing the preservation of federal records. Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, told ABCs program This Week, that the volume of information received by government officials often makes it difficult to know what information has been declared classified.  There were emails that contained classified information that had been improperly marked. So when she received the email, the material that was classified - which is supposed to be flagged and identified as classified - in many instances was improperly labeled, Kaine said. We look at so much material, unless it is specifically pulled out and identified, it is difficult to know sometimes whether a statement or a paragraph is classified or not, he added. Kaine likened Republican Donald Trumps recent call for Russia to find the 30,000 emails that are missing from Clintons server to the 1972 burglary at the Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate office in Washington that upended Richard Nixons presidency. He has openly encouraged Russia to engage in cyber hacking to try to find more e-mails or materials, and we know that this cyber attack on the DNC was likely done by Russia, Kaine told the Sunday television program. This is serious business. Trump was referring to some 30,000 emails deemed personal by Clintons lawyers that she has repeatedly said she chose not to keep while returning thousands of other work emails to the government in 2014. This has been widely interpreted as meaning that Clinton deleted the personal emails, but her staff have declined to confirm if this is the case. Clinton, who is facing Trump for the White House in the Nov. 8 election, has been dogged for more than a year by the fallout from her decision to use an unauthorized private email account run from the basement of her Chappaqua, New York, home. She repeatedly said she did not use it to send or receive classified information. The government forbids handling such information outside secure channels. Contradicting Clintons comment that she never exchanged classified information over her private email server, the FBI said that at least 81 email threads contained information that was classified at the time, although the agency said the final number may be more than 2,000. While the FBI has scolded Clinton over the handling of classified information, the agency recommended that no criminal charges be filed against her. Clinton has said that in hindsight she regretted using a private email system while secretary of state. Opinion polls show that voter concerns about Clintons honesty and trustworthiness are among her biggest vulnerabilities.  A series of surveys show the race has tightened over the past few weeks. In a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken during the week of Aug. 26 to Sept. 1, Trump had the support of 40 percent of likely voters while Clinton had the backing of 39 percent. Clintons support has dropped steadily in the weekly tracking poll since Aug. 25, eliminating what had been a eight-point lead for her. ",politicsNews,"September 4, 2016 ",1
Trump ally: Border wall's cost was deemed off limits in Mexico meeting,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A close ally of Donald Trump said talks about the cost of building a wall with Mexico was not supposed to be part of the discussion during Republican presidential candidates recent meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. After the two met in Mexico last Wednesday, Trump told reporters they did not discuss his demand that Mexico pay the cost for construction of a wall on the border between the two countries. Hours later, however, Pena Nieto said on Twitter he did raise the issue of the cost of the wall. At the beginning of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall, Pena Nieto said in a tweet. Speaking on CNNs State of the Union, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who accompanied Trump on the visit and was in the room during the meeting, said ground rules had been set prior to the discussion and advisers to the Republican presidential candidate and Pena Nietos team had agreed the cost of the wall would not be part of the conversation. We were not going to discuss paying for the wall because thats not something were going to agree about, he said. Giuliani acknowledged that the subject nonetheless was brought up by Pena Nieto. Maybe the presidents staff didnt brief him on it, maybe he forgot about it, so he brought it up, Giuliani said. It wasnt right at the very beginning, it was sort of in the middle and I just briefly said thats not on the table. Trump has characterized Mexican immigrants to the U.S. as rapists and drug dealers. In a newspaper article a day after the meeting, Pena Nieto said he made clear to Trump that in Mexico, we feel offended and hurt by his pronouncements about Mexicans. Instead of focusing on what they didnt agree on, Giuliani said the very productive conversation focused on issues the two countries had in common, such as trade-related issues with China. All the same complaints you hear from Donald Trump, President Pena Nieto would say exactly the same thing, he said. The same kind of dumping, the same kind of violation of a lot of the trade rules and regulations. ",politicsNews,"September 4, 2016 ",1
"Former Canadian PM rebukes Trump on NAFTA, predicts his defeat","TORONTO (Reuters) - Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on Sunday criticized Donald Trumps potential plan to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and said the U.S. presidential candidate will likely lose the Nov. 8 election.  Speaking on CTVs Question Period politics talk show, Mulroney, who in the 1980s signed a Canada-U.S. free trade deal, said scrapping NAFTA will hurt the United States. Millions and millions of jobs in the United States depend directly upon their trade with Canada and Mexico, Mulroney said. You tear that up - my mother used to say, Youre cutting off your nose to spite your face. Republican presidential nominee Trump has railed against the NAFTA trade deal with Canada and Mexico as a U.S. job killer, saying that if elected, he would be prepared to scrap it if he could not negotiate much better terms for the United States.  The North American Free Trade Agreement took effect in 1994 during the administration of President Bill Clinton, the husband of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.     Trump also has a hardline immigration plan that emphasized deporting illegal immigrants who commit crimes. His proposals include building a wall at the border with Mexico. Mulroney said that while Trumps rhetoric carried him through the Republican primaries, he does not think something that negative carries you to the White House. Trumps campaign team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  ",politicsNews,"September 4, 2016 ",1
Clinton tells FBI she could not recall all briefings on preserving documents,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton, under questioning by federal investigators over whether she had been briefed on how to preserve government records as she was about to leave the State Department, said she had suffered a concussion, was working part-time and could not recall every briefing she received. Clinton, the Democratic Partys presidential candidate, raised the health scare during her 3-1/2-hour interview with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Justice Department prosecutors on July 2, according to an FBI summary released on Friday. Besides the 11-page interview summary, the FBI also released other details of its investigation into her use of an unauthorized private email system while running the State Department, in which it concluded she mishandled classified information but not in a way that warranted a criminal prosecution. Clinton told investigators she could not recall getting any briefings on how to handle classified information or comply with laws governing the preservation of federal records, the summary of her interview shows. However, in December of 2012, Clinton suffered a concussion and then around the New Year had a blood clot, the FBIs summary said. Based on her doctors advice, she could only work at State for a few hours a day and could not recall every briefing she received.  A Clinton campaign aide said Clinton only referenced her concussion to explain she was not at work but for a few hours a day at that time, not that she did not remember things from that period.  The concussion was widely reported then, and Republicans have since used it to attack the 68-year-old candidates health in a way her staff have said is unfounded. The FBI report, which does not quote Clinton directly, is ambiguous about whether it was her concussion that affected her ability to recall briefings. The FBI declined to provide further comment on the report.   Clinton, who is challenging Republican Donald Trump for the White House in the Nov. 8 election, has been dogged for more than a year by the fallout from her decision to use an unauthorized private email account run from the basement of her Chappaqua, New York, home. Republicans have repeatedly attacked Clinton over the issue, helping drive opinion polls that show many U.S. voters doubt her trustworthiness.  Trumps campaign issued a statement immediately following the FBI reports release saying the notes from the interview reinforce her tremendously bad judgment and dishonesty.  Clinton has said that in hindsight she regretted using a private email system while secretary of state. According to the report, Clinton told the FBI that she did not set up a private email server to sidestep the law requiring her to keep her business communications a matter of public record.  At least one federal judge is examining whether this was the case as part of a lawsuit against the State Department concerning public access to Clintons government records, which the U.S. government said it had no access to in response to requests from members of the public. The documents also show that Clinton contacted former Secretary of State Colin Powell in 2009 to ask about his use of a personal BlackBerry phone.  In his reply to Clinton via email, Powell told Clinton to be very careful because the work-related emails she sent on her BlackBerry could become public record. I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data, Powell said, according to the summary. After her use of a private email system became public knowledge in March 2015, Clinton repeatedly said she did not use it to send or receive classified information. The government forbids handling such information outside secure channels. The FBI has since concluded Clinton was wrong to say that: At least 81 email threads contained information that was classified at the time, although the final number may be more than 2,000, the report said. Some of the emails appear to include discussion of planned future attacks by unmanned U.S. military drones, the FBI report showed. CLINTON believed the classification level of future drone strikes depended on the context, the FBIs interview summary said. The U.S. government requires that military plans be classified. The FBI released its report on Friday afternoon before the Labor Day holiday weekend, a time many Americans are preparing to travel.  State Department spokesman John Kirby said he would not comment on the FBIs findings because the department does not have full insight into the FBIs investigation. He declined to say whether State Department officials still discussed the planning of future attacks using drones in unclassified emails.  Im not going to speak to past email practices, he said. We trust State Department employees to use their best judgment when conveying sensitive information, taking into account a range of factors. The Clinton campaign released a statement welcoming the reports release.  While her use of a single email account was clearly a mistake and she has taken responsibility for it, these materials make clear why the Justice Department believed there was no basis to move forward with this case, Brian Fallon, a campaign spokesman, said in a statement. Some Republicans saw the files as confirming their belief that the Department of Justice should have prosecuted Clinton. These documents demonstrate Hillary Clintons reckless and downright dangerous handling of classified information during her tenure as secretary of state, Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, said in a statement. This is exactly why I have called for her to be denied access to classified information. ",politicsNews,"September 2, 2016 ",1
Trump calls for new civil rights agenda in visit to black church,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump stepped up his bid to win over minority voters by addressing a largely black church in Detroit on Saturday and calling for a new civil rights agenda to support African-Americans. As scores of protesters outside chanted No justice, no peace, Trump said he wanted to make Detroit - a predominantly African-American city which recently emerged from bankruptcy - the economic envy of the world by bringing back companies from abroad. Trump separately met with about 100 community and church leaders, his campaign said, in his latest push to peel away minority voters from Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. His outreach to minorities over recent weeks comes as he seeks to improve his chances in the Nov. 8 election and shake off months of offending the sensibilities of black and Hispanic voters with his hard line on immigration and rough-hewn rhetoric.   I fully understand that the African American community is suffering from discrimination and that there are many wrongs that must still be made right, Trump said at the church which was half-full. I want to make America prosperous for everyone. I want to make this city the economic envy of the world, and we can do that. His address of over 10 minutes at the Great Faith Ministries International church received moments of applause, including when he said Christian faith is not the past, but the present and the future. Accompanying Trump to the church was Ben Carson, the former Republican presidential hopeful who grew up in the city and whose childhood neighborhood Trump visited on Saturday. Trump has argued that his emphasis on job creation would help minority communities in a way that Democrats have failed to. But Clinton has accused Trump of aligning himself with racists.  Opinion polls show Trump has low support among minorities. I believe we need a civil rights agenda for our time, one that ensures the rights to a great education, so important, and the right to live in a good-paying job and one that you love to go to every morning, Trump said. That can happen. We need to bring our companies back, he added. Emma Lockridge, 63, said as she entered the church that she found his comments about Mexicans and Muslims hateful. Thats my major reservation with Mr. Trump is how hes treated those particular sets of people, said Lockridge, who is retired and an environmental activist.  But she said she also had concerns about Clintons support in the 1990s for crime legislation signed by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, which many black Americans say contributed to high incarceration rates in their communities. Vicki Dobbins, an activist protesting outside, said she was disappointed the church asked Trump to speak. I believe that Trump coming to Detroit is a joke, and Im ashamed of the pastor who invited him, she said. In my opinion, he stabbed everyone in the back. ",politicsNews,"September 3, 2016 ",1
"Trump, pushing immigration plan, meets with family of woman killed in 2007","PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Donald Trump sought to sell Americans on his tough approach to immigration on Friday, meeting in Philadelphia with the family of a woman who was killed in a 2007 shooting that involved people who came to the United States illegally. Trump this week unveiled a hardline immigration plan that emphasized deporting illegal immigrants who commit crimes. His plan was cheered by other immigration critics, but some Hispanic backers and moderate Republicans felt it lacked compassion toward millions of people in the United States illegally. Trump often points to examples of people hurt by illegal immigrants to defend his tough positions, which include building a wall at the border with Mexico, though some studies have found immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes. On Friday, he met with the family of Iofemi Hightower, who was 20 years old when she and two others were killed in a schoolyard in Newark, New Jersey. At least one of the people convicted in the 2007 shootings was in the United States illegally, according to a New York Times report in 2010 about the trials. Another had likely entered the country illegally and later gained legal status, the paper said. These are people that shouldnt be in the country, Trump told reporters. A lot of people dont even know, they have no idea the consequence of these people coming in. Shalga Hightower, 55, Iofemis mother, said her family endured seven years of legal trials, as well as a period of homelessness and job loss. Asked if she would be supporting Trump for president, she said yes. Her son, Jamar Hightower, 26, said Trump was the only person paying attention to the problem of crimes committed by people living in the United States illegally. I feel as though this man is the only one thats actually standing up to do something about it, Jamar Hightower said. This is not a problem that just started. Theyve been here.

U.S. lawmakers question Mylan's Medicaid EpiPen rebates,"(Reuters) - Two key U.S. congressional committee members on Friday called for an investigation into whether Mylan NV, under fire for raising the price of its EpiPen device, overcharged the governments low-income healthcare program for the allergy treatment. In a letter to the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Frank Pallone, both Democrats, seek clarification of whether EpiPen was classified as a generic, non-innovator drug, or a brand-name drug by the Medicaid program. Under current law, branded drugs, and generic drugs available from a single source, are required to pay a rebate amount of at least 23.1 percent of the average manufacturer price. Generic drugs are subject to a much lower 13 percent rebate. Mylan, in an emailed statement, said it has complied with all laws and regulations regarding Medicaid rebates, and intends to file with regulators, by next April as required under new guidelines, for EpiPen to be classified as a non-innovator product. The device jabs a dose of the drug epinephrine into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions such as to peanuts, food allergies and bee stings.  Mylan, whose tax address is in the Netherlands but which has corporate headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, has raised the U.S. price of EpiPen from less than $100 when it acquired the product in 2007 to more than $600. Amid an outcry by parents, consumer groups and U.S. politicians, the company said on Monday it will soon launch the first generic version of the device for $300, half the list price of its branded product.  Wyden, ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, and Pallone, ranking member of the House Energy & Commerce Committee, said in the letter on Friday: It has recently come to our attention that Mylan has classified EpiPen as a generic drug under the Medicaid rebate program, even though it is considered a new drug by the Food and Drug Administration. Shares of Mylan, which fell 4.7 percent to close at $39.97 on Friday, have dropped 19 percent since mid-August. ",politicsNews,"September 2, 2016 ",1
"Trump catches up to Clinton, latest Reuters/Ipsos poll finds","(Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has pulled into an effective tie with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, erasing a substantial deficit as he consolidated support among his partys likely voters in recent weeks, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll released Friday. The poll showed 40 percent of likely voters supporting Trump and 39 percent backing Clinton for the week of Aug. 26 to Sept. 1. Clintons support has dropped steadily in the weekly tracking poll since Aug. 25, eliminating what had been a eight-point lead for her. Trumps gains came as Republican support for their partys candidate jumped by six percentage points over the past two weeks, to about 78 percent. That is still below the 85 percent support Republican nominee Mitt Romney enjoyed in the summer of 2012, but the improvement helps explain Trumps rise in the poll. The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English in all 50 states. The latest poll surveyed 1,804 likely voters over the course of the week; it had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of three percent. Different polls have produced widely different results over the course of the campaign. In part thats because some, like Reuters/Ipsos, have attempted to measure the preferences of whos likely to vote, while others have surveyed the larger pool of all registered voters. And even those that survey likely voters have different ways of estimating who is likely to cast a ballot.  Polling aggregators, which calculate averages of major polls, have shown that Clintons lead has been shrinking for the past few weeks. Those averages put her advantage over Trump at between three and six percentage points. Some of the more recent individual polls, however, have the race even tighter. Voters dont elect the American president directly, of course, but through the Electoral College, an assembly representing each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia based on the number of legislators they have in Congress. As of last Friday, the separate Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation polling project estimated Clinton was on track to win the Electoral College, by about 332 votes to 206. Those numbers were scheduled to be updated later Friday. In recent weeks, Clinton has come under renewed criticism over her handling of classified information while serving as U.S. secretary of state, and her familys charitable foundation has come under fresh scrutiny for the donations it accepted while Clinton served in the Obama administration. Meanwhile, Clinton hasnt been campaigning as actively as Trump. Trump, meanwhile, has reshuffled his campaign leadership and sought to broaden his appeal to moderate Republicans and minorities. He recently suggested that he would be a better president than Clinton for African Americans, and has taken steps, including a meeting this week with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, to reach out to immigrants. It remains to be seen whether those efforts will click. Clinton has led Trump through most of the campaign for the November election, though neither candidate appears to have inspired America.  In the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, more than 20 percent of likely voters opted for a choice other than the two major nominees, whether an alternative candidate, would not vote or unsure. That figure is significantly higher than the 10 percent to 14 percent of respondents who answered similarly at this point in the 2012 campaign. Both President Barack Obama and Republican rival Mitt Romney enjoyed substantially stronger support at this point in the summer of 2012 than either Trump or Clinton does now. And while Trump has consolidated his support among Republicans, likely voters are expressing an increasingly sour view of Clinton: The share of likely voters with an unfavorable view of the former secretary of state has grown to 57 percent, compared with Trumps 54 percent, her worst showing on that metric in a month. Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said he remains convinced Clinton is ahead, somewhere in the range seen among the polling aggregators. There has been a closing thats completely natural, Sabato said. Every four years, you have two national party conventions that produce a bounce of varying sizes. Clinton got a substantial bounce this year that lasted for a full month. Its usually gone around Labor Day, and by then well be where we should be, which is right around four to five points for Clinton. In a separate question in the Reuters/Ipsos poll that included alternative-party candidates, Clinton and Trump were tied at 39 percent. Seven percent supported Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, and two percent supported Jill Stein of the Green Party. ",politicsNews,"September 2, 2016 ",1
New Jersey Governor Christie upends old income tax deal with Pennsylvania,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Christie said on Friday the state would begin taxing income earned by people who work in New Jersey but live in Pennsylvania, ending a long-standing arrangement with the neighboring state. Pulling out of the nearly 40-year old reciprocity agreement would allow New Jersey to raise more revenue starting Jan. 1. Christie, a close ally of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, said in a statement that he was forced to act because the Democrat-controlled legislature created a $250 million budget hole in June by relying on public employee health insurance cuts they have not yet made. If lawmakers come back next week and cut health costs, Christie could consider revising his termination of the reciprocal tax pact. I will not raise state taxes, cut property tax relief, reduce aid to education or our hospitals, or reduce the states record pension payment to cover for this blunder by the legislature, Christie said.  Jeff Sheridan, press secretary to Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, said Christie erred significantly in his decision to unnecessarily punish 125,000 Pennsylvanians and cost the commonwealth $5 million annually. He said Wolf, a Democrat, was hopeful Christie would change his mind. However, Christie seems committed to making Pennsylvania suffer the consequences of his failure to enact a responsible budget in a bipartisan way, Sheridan said. Pennsylvanians pay a flat 3.07 percent income tax rate with no personal exemptions. New Jerseyans pay higher rates the more they make, with progressive rates increasing from 1.4 percent to 8.97 percent. The reciprocal agreement is advantageous for high-income Pennsylvania residents who work in New Jersey, because they pay their states lower tax rate. It is also good for low-income New Jerseyans who work across the border because of New Jerseys progressive tax system. New Jersey Senate President Steve Sweeney said in a statement that ending the scheme is the wrong decision for our state and that more than 100,000 New Jersey residents will pay almost $1,000 per year in additional income tax.  The burden falls completely on working families in New Jersey, especially those in South Jersey who work in Philadelphia, and will have a very real impact on their quality of life, he said.

Mexican senator to propose anti-Trump expropriation law,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A Mexican senator is proposing legislation to empower the government to retaliate if a U.S. administration led by Donald Trump inflicts expropriations or economic losses on his country to make it pay for a border wall. Republican presidential nominee Trump has vowed to have Mexico fund the planned wall to keep out illegal immigrants if he is elected, and threatened to fund it by blocking remittances sent home by Mexicans living in the United States. Armando Rios Piter, an opposition senator for the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), will next week present the initiative he hopes will protect Mexicans, and highlight the risks of targeting them economically. The plan offers a taste of the kind of tit-for-tat measures that could gain traction between the two heavily-integrated economies if Trump wins the presidency at the Nov. 8 election. In a preliminary summary of the proposal, which also foresees giving the Senate the power to disavow international treaties when the interests of Mexico or its companies are threatened by other signatories, it states: In cases where the property/assets of (our) fellow citizens or companies are affected by a foreign government, as Donald Trump has threatened, the Mexican government should proportionally expropriate assets and properties of foreigners from that country on our territory. Total remittances to Mexico from abroad - most of which come from the United States - were worth nearly $25 billion last year, according to the central bank. Bilateral trade between the two nations is worth about half a trillion dollars a year. Trump has also threatened to tear up a trade deal with Mexico if it is not recast in the United States favor. He met President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City this week, sparking fierce criticism in Mexico of the government for hosting him. Afterwards, Trump repeated his pledge to make Mexico foot the bill for the wall. Mexico says it will not pay. It is yet to be established how such expropriations could work, nor is it clear what chance the bill could have of passing. The PRD and other leftist parties hold less than a quarter of the 128 seats in Mexicos Senate. Rios Piter said his aim was to counter threats by Trump to target Mexicans in the United States and to stress that the economic welfare of both nations is at stake. At a time like this, its vital for us to understand why this relationship benefits both. Were neighbors, were friends, were partners, he said. Hes putting (that) at risk. The initiative also seeks to protect Mexico against unilateral changes to the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which Trump has threatened to ditch.

Clinton offers plan to curb 'unjustified' price hikes on life-saving drugs,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton said on Friday that if elected to the White House she would create an oversight panel to protect U.S. consumers from large price hikes on long-available, lifesaving drugs and to import alternative treatments if necessary, adding to her pledges to rein in overall drug prices. Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, would seek to give the panel an aggressive new set of enforcement tools, including the ability to levy fines and impose penalties on manufacturers when there has been an unjustified, outlier price increase on a long-available or generic drug, her campaign said. Over the past year, weve seen far too many examples of drug companies raising prices excessively for long-standing, life-saving treatments with little or no new innovation or R&D, Clinton said in a statement. If Clinton defeats Republican rival Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election, she would need the support of the U.S. Congress to implement key measures of her proposal, which follows a broader plan to rein in drug prices that she announced a year ago. Even though her latest plan would likely affect a small number of companies, it could be difficult to get Republican lawmakers on board, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said, adding that a Republican Congress would push back hard on this. Clintons campaign cited Turing Pharmaceuticals LLCs raising the price of its AIDS drug Daraprim (pyrimethamine) and Mylan NVs repeated steep price increases on EpiPen for severe allergy sufferers as troubling examples of price hikes that have attracted bipartisan congressional scrutiny. Conover said Clintons plan to address unjustified price hikes is less of a concern to the drug industry than her pledge last year to reduce drug prices overall. Drugmakers have said that lowering or limiting drug prices would hamper their ability to invest in research and lead to fewer new therapies. The ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large U.S. and European drugmakers rose 0.30 percent on Friday, in line with gains for the broad stock market. Shares of Mylan fell 4.6 percent to $40.00 on the Nasdaq. The Nasdaq biotech index slipped 0.40 percent. The decline was slight compared to the more than 4.7 percent drop in the index seen on Sept. 21, 2015, when Clinton blasted price gouging in the specialty drug market on Twitter, responding to reports that Turing had acquired Daraprim, an older antibiotic, and then hiked its price by 5,000 percent.  Soon afterward, Clinton presented a general plan to lower prescription drug costs, including allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and demand higher rebates for prescription drugs.  Her plan would also include caps on monthly and annual out-of-pocket costs for patients with chronic or serious health conditions. It aims to prohibit manufacturers from paying generic drugmakers to delay launching their cheaper products, and would eliminate corporate writeoffs for direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising. Dr. Peter Bach, the director of a nonpartisan health policy research group at New Yorks Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said Clintons announcement on Friday was a flag for drug manufacturers that her administration would notice and respond to steep price hikes. Its a response to the broader industry phenomenon of generating added profits by raising the price of drugs for which there is no competition, Bach said, saying the campaign was focusing on a sub-category of manufacturers that had not invested heavily in developing a drug. Bach said he was contacted by the Clinton campaign about his work on drug pricing but had not advised the campaign in a formal capacity. The oversight panel would be made up of representatives from existing public health and consumer protection agencies who convene to examine the scope of a drug price increase, the manufacturers production cost and the treatments relative value to patients and public health, Clintons campaign said. Terry Haines, head of political analysis for Evercore ISI, said Clintons proposed panel had little hope of getting through Congress.  But Clinton, if elected, might be able to achieve price reform via changes to Medicares prescription drug benefit, known as Medicare Part D, if she works with Congress to reform the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, Haines said. In that event, Haines said shares of pharmaceutical and biotech companies could come under sustained headline risk in 2017 as ACA reforms are discussed.         In cases where a price hike determined to be unjustified is accompanied by insufficient market competition, Clintons administration would intervene to purchase alternative drugs from comparably regulated markets or assist manufacturers in bringing the product to market in the United States. Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, called it a bold idea to get the federal government involved in helping stabilizing some of these generic drug markets. Until recently, there was a lengthy wait for generic drug approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Although the wait time has shortened, there is often not enough consistent demand for manufacturers to enter the U.S. market, Kesselheim said. Having the government get involved as a long-term purchaser of these products creates a stockpile to stabilize the market, he said. Kesselheim has testified before Congress about high-cost generic and long-available drugs and spoke to Clintons campaign about his research as it developed its proposals.

Maine Senate leaders will not seek special session to chide LePage,"BOSTON (Reuters) - (Editors note: This story contains language in the second paragraph that may offend readers) The president of Maines state Senate on Friday said he would not pursue a special session to censure Governor Paul LePage for leaving a profanity-laden voicemail message for a lawmaker amid a dispute about the governors comments on race and drug dealing. Senator Michael Thibodeau, who like LePage is a Republican, earlier in the week had said he was interested in a one-day special session to officially reprimand the two-term governor for calling a Democratic state legislator a little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker. But on Friday he said he would not follow the lead of state House Speaker Mark Eves, who began polling lawmakers in his chamber as to whether they were ready to call a special session to take action regarding the Governors conduct. He is unfit to serve as Governor and must resign or be removed from office, Eves said of LePage in a statement on Friday. That query, Thibodeau said, went further than Senate Republicans were willing to go, adding that his party had been ready to vote for a one-day session to vote on an official censure of LePage, whose current term extends through 2018. Were not interested in coming back for impeachment, Thibodeau told reporters. The state House and Senate both adjourned in April and are not due to meet again until after the November elections. LePage has faced a flurry of criticism over the past week for saying that members of minority groups from out of state were responsible for the lions share of the heroin trade in Maine. He drew further criticism after leaving a profane and widely circulated voicemail for a lawmaker that he believed had called him a racist. Earlier in the week he mused during a 15-minute radio interview about the idea of not finishing out his term, only to come back a day later to say that he would not resign. Earlier this year a group of lawmakers started an effort to impeach him, contending the governor overstepped his authority by threatening to withhold funds from a nonprofit group that hired a political rival, but that effort collapsed before making it to the full House. Under Maines constitution, Thibodeau would have been first in line to succeed LePage if he stepped down or was removed from office. ",politicsNews,"September 2, 2016 ",1
One secret of Trump's low-cost campaign: free labor,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has run an unusually cheap campaign in part by notpaying at least10 top staffers, consultantsand advisers,some of whom are no longer with the campaign, according toa review offederal campaign finance filings. Those who have so far not been paid, the filings show, include recently departed campaign manager Paul Manafort, California state director Tim Clark, communications director Michael Caputo and a pair of senior aides who left the campaign in June to immediately go to work for a Trump Super PAC.  The New York real estate magnate and his allies have touted his campaigns frugality, saying it is evidence of his management skills. His campaigns spending has totaled $89.5 million so far, about a third of what Democratic rival Hillary Clintons campaign has spent. But not compensating top people in a presidential campaign is a departure from campaign finance norms. Many of the positions involved might typically come with six-figure annual paychecks in other campaigns. Its unprecedented for a presidential campaign to rely so heavily on volunteers for top management positions, said Paul Ryan, an election lawyer with the campaign finance reform advocacy group Campaign Legal Center. The Trump campaign said the Reuters reporting was sloppy at best but declined to elaborate. One of the 10 who were unpaid, Michael Caputo, told a Buffalo radio station in June after he resigned from the campaign, that he was not volunteering. Rather, he said he just had not gotten paid. Caputo confirmed to Reuters on Thursday that the Trump campaign has still not paid his invoices.  In another instance, two high-level former Trump campaign advisers, former Chris Christie campaign manager Ken McKay and Manafort lobbying associate Laurance Gay, departed the Trump campaign in June and went to work for the Trump-backed Super PAC, Rebuilding America Now. In June, the Super PAC paid each of them $60,000, the filings show.   Federal campaign law stipulates that people working for campaigns, who may possess strategic knowledge of a campaign or work as a campaigns agents, must wait for 120 days before going to work for a Super PAC, a political spending group that can accept unlimited sums of money from wealthy donors so long as it does not coordinate with a campaign.  Through a spokesperson, McKay and Gay said they were volunteering for Trump and did not possess strategic information so the rule did not apply to them.  Another example of free labor is Rick Gates, who was Manaforts deputy. According to two former high-level Trump staffers, Gates essentially functioned as the Trump campaign manager for more than two months, all while not collecting a paycheck.  By contrast, Democratic nominee Hillary Clintons campaign manager Robby Mook earned roughly $10,000 in July, the same amount as President Barack Obamas campaign manager Jim Messina did in 2012. That same year, Republican nominee Mitt Romneys campaign manager, Matt Rhoades, was making nearly $7,000 bi-monthly. Others who, according to the FEC filings, have not been paid include finance chairman Steven Mnuchin, national political director Rick Wiley and senior adviser Barry Bennett, who were not available for comment. Nor were Manafort, Gates and Clark. Many campaigns have volunteers who work as low-level ground troops, knocking on voters doors and passing out campaign buttons. There are instances in other campaigns of senior staff opting not to draw a paycheck. For example, John Podesta, a longtime adviser to Clinton who is now her campaign chairman, considers his role honorary and does not draw a salary. What is unusual, however, is for a campaign to have such a large group of people in top positions who are unpaid.  After Manafort resigned in August, Trump promoted his senior adviser and top pollster, Kellyanne Conway, to become his new campaign manager.  Before then, Conway ran a Super PAC affiliated with Texas Senator and Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz. For work from June 2015 to June 2016, the Super PAC paid the firm she owns more than $700,000. She officially joined the Trump campaign July 1. But so far, according to campaign finance reports that detail spending through July 31, Conway has not been paid by the Trump campaign. She did not respond to a request for comment.

"State Department vetted Bill Clinton’s contacts, emails show","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Clinton Foundation on multiple occasions during Hillary Clintons tenure as secretary of state asked senior U.S. government officials to vet her husbands contacts with potentially controversial international figures, according to emails released by the State Department. The emails, reviewed by Reuters, were part of a batch of nearly 400 messages recently released by the State Department after requests from the conservative group Citizens United, a group that has long been critical of the Clintons. The exchanges show a top foreign policy adviser to the foundation sought guidance from the State Department on former President Bill Clintons interactions with people including Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Russian government officials and business leaders, and Gulnara Karimova, the socialite daughter of Uzbekistans late president. The emails offer a glimpse of the intricate relationship between a private charity with a broad global mission and the State Department under the leadership of a secretary who is married to a former president. Former government officials reached by Reuters said there was nothing inappropriate in the interactions of the foundation with the State Department over the potential meetings, some of which did not occur. The latest batch of emails likely represents only a partial view of all the exchanges between the State Department and the foundation. It is unclear how frequently the foundation sought advice from the State Department on meetings involving Bill Clinton. In one instance, the emails show Amitabh Desai, a foreign policy adviser to the foundation and to Bill Clinton, raised the possibility in 2009 of a meeting between Bill Clinton and Syrian President Assad. At the time, Assad wanted better ties with the West. Would this be concerning for State? Desai wrote in an email alerting Hillary Clinton aide Jake Sullivan to the possible meeting. The Syrians expressed a keen interest in facilitating this, Desai said in an email a few days later. The Syria visit was proposed to be tacked onto a forum Bill Clinton was invited to attend in Israel in November 2009, according to the emails. The meeting never happened, according to Martin Indyk, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel who helped  to organize the trip. The State Department sometimes communicates with charities, such as about circumstances that might involve the safety of Americans or highly sensitive diplomatic situations, but it typically does not vet their contacts with foreign leaders to this extent. State Department spokesman Elizabeth Trudeau said officials occasionally provide talking points and briefings to ex-presidents. Much of Bill Clintons communications with the State Department stemmed from an ethics agreement that was put in place when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009. The agreement was aimed at avoiding conflicts of interests stemming from contributions to the foundation and Bill Clintons paid speeches and consulting. Trudeau said these were voluntary steps taken to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. Angel Urena, press secretary for Bill Clinton, said the requests for State Department input on potential meetings, talking points and other information was done in order toinform the administration of President Clintons interactions with foreigngovernmentsand dignitaries, so that the administration could in turn offer advice or voice any concerns. Urena said Bill Clinton had sought advice on his activities since he left office in 2001. The Clinton Foundation referred questions to Urena. Hillary Clintons presidential campaign declined to comment. Clintons campaign to win the Nov. 8 presidential election has been dogged by criticism of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, a global philanthropic organization. The foundation has said it will stop accepting at least some foreign and corporate donations if Hillary Clinton becomes president and that Bill Clinton would resign from the foundations board. In one previously unreported email exchange, Desai wrote to the State Department in May 2012 informing officials that Bill Clinton would travel to Monaco to raise money for the foundation at an event where he might cross paths with the elder daughter of the Uzbekistan president. Gulnara Karimova, a businesswoman and pop star, was described in a 2005 cable from a U.S. embassy official as the single most hated person in Uzbekistan because of her flamboyant lifestyle in an authoritarian country. She has since come under investigation in an international bribery scandal. Ahead of the event in Monaco, Desai wrote that the organizers had invited Karimova to be one of the events sponsors apparently without our approval. The Uzbekistan presidents daughter will be listed in the program and will see (Bill Clinton), he said. Would (the U.S. government) have concerns? If so, we can go back to organizer and ask them to return her sponsorship and disinvite her, however I assume that would ruffle some feathers, Desai said. The emails released to Citizens United dont contain a reply to Desais inquiry. However, a collection of photos from the Monaco event posted on the internet show Karimova attended it. They do not show any pictures of her with Bill Clinton. ",politicsNews,"September 2, 2016 ",1
Clinton Foundation plans to close overseas fundraising arms,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation will shut down its fundraising affiliates in Sweden and the United Kingdom if Hillary Clinton wins the U.S. presidency in November, a spokesman for the global charity said this week. The foundation has in recent weeks begun announcing planned new donor restrictions to allay criticism that wealthy supporters might be expecting special treatment from the U.S. government in return. Both the William J. Clinton Foundation UK in London and the Clinton Foundation Insamlingsstiftelse in Stockholm will close if Clinton becomes president because of their acceptance of foreign funding, Brian Cookstra, a spokesman for the Clinton Foundation in New York, said in one of a series of emails responding to questions from Reuters. Both organizations exist to receive donations overseas, neither have any employees, and they are overseen by board members of the main Clinton Foundation in the United States, their financial statements show. Some of the foundations foreign outposts have drawn extra scrutiny because donors can give money anonymously.  The foundation said last month it would no longer accept foreign funding for at least some of its work if Clinton is elected, although Donald Trump, Clintons Republican rival for the presidency, continues to accuse Clinton of being corrupted by foreign donors. She has dismissed this as a political smear. In order to become President Barack Obamas secretary of state in 2009, Clinton signed an ethics agreement promising to annually publish the names of all donors to her familys philanthropy, including foreign governments that have collectively given tens of millions of dollars.  Clinton also promised that her charities would seek prior approval from the State Departments ethics office before accepting new donations from foreign governments. The charities have since conceded they did not keep these promises, blaming oversights. (reut.rs/2c7iqgk) The foundations outpost in Stockholm has received nearly 270 million Swedish crowns, about $30 million, since it was established in 2011, while Clinton was still secretary of state.  Most of this money was given by the Swedish Postcode Lottery and the Dutch Postcode Lottery, according to the Clinton Foundation Insamlingsstiftelses website. About $6 million came from other donors that are not disclosed by the Clinton Foundation Insamlingsstiftelse. Cookstra said those donors were included in the donor list published on the main Clinton Foundations website but declined to identify them or say why they were donating in Sweden rather than the United States. The foundation also declined to explain a discrepancy in donations in records from 2012. The Swedish Postcode Lottery Foundation said it donated 6.6 million crowns (about $1 million) that year, but the Clinton Foundation reported this amount as 19.7 million crowns (about $3 million). Cookstra also declined to say whether the foundation has other fundraising arms set up in foreign countries besides the United Kingdom and Sweden. The British arm of the Clinton Foundation has raised at least $400,000 since 2007, according to records held by the British governments Charity Commission. The State Department says it has no record of being notified about the foundations overseas outposts during Clintons tenure. The State Department was not responsible for monitoring or approving the organization and operation of the Clinton Foundation or its offshoots, Elizabeth Trudeau, a department spokeswoman, said in a statement. The Department reviewed all information submitted to it. You would need to ask the Foundation whether there were additional matters that it should have submitted for State Department review.

Organizers name TV journalists to moderate U.S. presidential debates,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Journalists from NBC, ABC, CNN and Fox News will moderate the three scheduled debates between U.S. presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ahead of the Nov. 8 election, the nonpartisan group organizing the events said on Friday. NBC anchor Lester Holt will ask questions at the first debate on Sept. 26 in New York, while ABC global affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz and CNN anchor Anderson Cooper will co-moderate the Oct. 9 town meeting style debate in St. Louis, the Commission on Presidential Debates said.  Fox News anchor Chris Wallace will moderate on Oct. 19 in Las Vegas, it said in a statement. CBS journalist Elaine Quijano will moderate the single vice presidential debate on Oct. 4 between Republican Indiana Governor Mike Pence and his Democratic rival, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, the commission said.  C-SPANs Steve Scully will be a back-up moderator for all four of the debates, it added. Trump, the Republican candidate, has said he will take part in the three debates but wants to see the conditions. Representatives for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Fridays announcement. The New York businessman, who has never held elected office, has had repeated run-ins with the media since launching his campaign last year, charging networks like CNN with phony reporting, sparring with MSNBC hosts and insulting Fox News journalist Megyn Kelly. His campaign has also black-listed several reporters and news outlets. Clinton, the Democratic candidate, has said she will participate in all three debates as scheduled.  Separately, NBC has said Trump and Clinton will participate in a commander-in-chief forum focused on military issues on Sept. 7 in New York, appearing separately. On Friday, Trumps son Eric raised questions about ties between the anchor for that event, Matt Lauer, and the Clinton Foundation and said NBC and its cable offshoot MSNBC have been against his father. Obviously, theres a lot of speculation because of his involvement with the foundation, Eric Trump told Fox News in an interview. I hope hell be fair. Representatives for NBC said Lauer was not a member of the foundation and that he had interviewed former President Bill Clinton for the networks Today show, not on behalf of the foundation. Trumps reality television show, The Apprentice, debuted on NBC in 2004. NBC later cut other ties with the businessman, dropping his Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants, and Trump sued. NBC is a unit of Comcast Corp.. Fox News is part of the Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, ABC News is owned by Walt Disney Co, while Time Warner Inc owns CNN. CBS Corp is also publicly traded.

Hispanic backers sour on Trump after immigration speech,"WILMINGTON, Ohio/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some of Donald Trumps Hispanic backers distanced themselves from the Republican nominee on Thursday for standing by a hardline approach to illegal immigration in a key speech after indicating for weeks that he may soften his approach. Trump tried to clarify confusion about immigration, his signature policy issue, in a speech on Wednesday. He said the only way undocumented foreigners could live in the United States legally if he is elected on Nov. 8 would be to leave the country and apply for re-entry. But the businessman, trailing Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in opinion polls, did back away from earlier promises to deport immediately the 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally and said he would prioritize those with criminal records. While polls show a large majority of Hispanic voters oppose Trump, the withdrawal of support from among his small group of Latino backers underscores how difficult it is for Trump to broaden his support with minorities and moderate voters.     Alfonso Aguilar, who recently organized a support letter on behalf of Trump, said he felt disappointed and misled by the fiery speech and withdrew his backing.  For the last two months he said he was not going to deport people without criminal records. He actually said that he was going to treat undocumented immigrants without criminal records in a humane and compassionate way, Aguilar told CNN. He is the president of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles group.   Trump used his Wednesday appearance in Phoenix to clarify his stance on illegal immigration. But instead of moderating his message as many expected, Trump returned to the hardline rhetoric that powered him to victory in the Republican presidential nomination race over 16 rivals, heartening conservatives drawn to Trump by the issue.       Some members of a council Trump formed last month to advise him on Hispanic issues expressed reservations about or cut ties to the New York real estate developers candidacy after the Phoenix speech. Jacob Monty, a Texas attorney and member of the group, said he was withdrawing his support and would not vote in the election. There was nothing pro-business in that speech, Monty told MSNBC. We were hoping for some glimmer of the Donald Trump that we met with a week and half ago, but it never came. Panel member Ramiro Pena, a Baptist pastor in Texas who spoke at the Republican National Convention in July, wrote in an email to party leaders that he believed Trump would lose the election and that the advisory panel was a scam.  But other Latino advisers, including Florida pastor Mario Bramnick and Kentucky State Senator Ralph Alvardo, said they would continue working with the Trump campaign. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus downplayed the fallout from Trumps speech, telling CNN that the nominee made clear he first wants to build the border wall and deal with criminal elements, then have a humane conversation about other illegal immigrants. Somehow or another no one is talking about that piece, Priebus said.  At a campaign rally on Thursday in Wilmington, Ohio, Trump said his immigration plan would treat everyone with dignity, respect and compassion but prioritize compassion for American citizens and include some kind of ideological screening.  We only want to admit those into our country who share our values and love our people, Trump said.      Trump gave his Phoenix address, which was flagged as a major policy speech, just hours after he met with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City.  At a joint press conference after the meeting, Trump said the pair discussed his campaign promise to build a border wall but not which country would pay for it. Pena Nieto said on Twitter on Wednesday night he had made it clear Mexico would not be paying for the wall. Trump supporters at the Wilmington rally said they approved of the candidates immigration policies but moderate Republicans in Arizona, where Latinos make up more than 30 percent of the population, told Reuters they were less swayed by his message. Clintons campaign called Trumps immigration speech a disaster and said it would begin running advertisements in Arizona, a sign it sees a chance of winning a state that has long backed Republican presidential candidates. Clinton raised about $143 million in August for her presidential bid and the Democratic Party, her campaign announced. Trump has not yet released his fundraising totals for the month of August.

Putin says he doesn't know who hacked U.S. Democratic Party: Bloomberg,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said he did not know who was behind the hacking of U.S. Democratic Party organizations but the information uncovered was important, Bloomberg news agency reported on Friday. In an interview two days before a G20 meeting in China with U.S. President Barack Obama and other world leaders, Putin said it might be impossible to establish who engineered the release of sensitive Democratic Party emails but it was not done by the Russian government. Does it even matter who hacked this data? Putin said. The important thing is the content that was given to the public. Theres no need to distract the publics attention from the essence of the problem by raising some minor issues connected with the search for who did it, he added. But I want to tell you again, I dont know anything about it, and on a state level Russia has never done this. The hacked emails, released by activist group WikiLeaks in July, appeared to show favoritism within the Democratic National Committee (DNC) for presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and prompted the resignation of the bodys chairwoman. A computer network used by Clintons campaign, and the partys fundraising committee for the U.S. House of Representatives were also hacked. Clinton, who polls show as leading Donald Trump in the campaign for the U.S. presidential election in November, has said Russian intelligence services conducted a cyber attack against her party. Some officials have suggested Moscow is trying to influence the U.S. election. Putin dismissed the allegations. We have never interfered, are not interfering and do not intend to interfere in domestic politics, he said.  We will carefully watch what happens and wait for the election results. Then we are ready to work with any American administration, if they want to themselves. Relations between Russia and United States hit a post-Cold War low in 2014 over the Ukraine crisis, and Washington and Moscow have since clashed over diverging policies in Syria. Obama said in August he would discuss the cyber attack with Putin if Russia was responsible, but it would not wildly alter the two countries relationship. The U.S. election contest has been hard fought and frequently dominated by both candidates attitudes toward Russia. Clinton has rounded on her Republican rival Trump for his perceived praise of Putin and what she says is an absolute allegiance to Russias foreign policy aims. Trump, in return, has said Clintons own close ties to the Russian president deserve greater scrutiny. Putin said both candidates were using shock tactics and that playing the anti-Russian card was short-sighted. I wouldnt like for us to follow their example, he said. I dont think they are setting the best example. ",politicsNews,"September 2, 2016 ",1
"Obama visits Midway Atoll, a symbol of his climate, Asia legacy","MIDWAY ATOLL (Reuters) - President Barack Obama snorkeled on Thursday in the electric-blue water off Midway Atoll, a remote coral reef that serves as a reminder of both modern global climate challenges and the United States dominance in the Pacific since its World War Two victory there. The journey was aimed at sending a message about the need to protect vulnerable species and spaces from the ravages of climate change. But it was also timed as Obama makes his way to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and other world leaders in his last visit to Asia, having sought to refocus U.S. defense and trade policy on the region. Its a signal, its a message saying the United States is committed to staying in the Pacific, and not sort of backing away, said naval historian Tom Hone, who has studied the Battle of Midway. Zipping around the island in an 18-golf-cart motorcade filled with Secret Service, aides and camera crews, Obama stopped to see several endangered green sea turtles lazily paddle in to bask on the white sand beach. When I grew up, wed see these turtles all the time. You almost never see them beaching like this, just basking in the sun, said Obama, who grew up in Hawaii, more than 1,100 nautical miles to the southeast. Obama, whose presidency comes to an end in five months, has tried to use his time in office to make Americans more passionate about climate change. Less than 5 percent of American voters say the environment is the most important issue facing the country, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling between July 24 and Aug. 21, and 35 percent say climate change will not affect the way they vote in the Nov. 8 election to pick Obamas successor. The island visit bookends Obamas trip last year to Alaska, where he hiked on a shrinking glacier. These arent photo ops - I think these are real opportunities to help the American people understand, said Carol Browner, a former head of the Environmental Protection Agency who advised Obama on climate issues in his first term. He can get a level of attention that nobody else can get, Browner said. Last week, Obama quadrupled the size of Papahnaumokukea Marine National Monument to create the worlds largest marine monument, protecting the area off the coast of Hawaii from commercial fishing and drilling. This is going to be a precious resource for generations to come, said Obama, his dress shirt undone an extra button in the sauna-like heat. This is hallowed ground, he said near a beach where young soldiers hunkered down under pillboxes, awaiting Japanese fighter planes during the World War Two Battle of Midway, one of the most-studied battles in military history. Had it not been for the courage and the bravery of those airmen, we might have not seen the tide turn in the battle of the Pacific, he said. In June 1942, U.S. forces, tipped by code-breakers that the Japanese navy was planning an attack, sank four Japanese aircraft carriers and a heavy cruiser in a giant air and sea battle. Obamas golf cart motorcade bumped over a tarmac pock-marked by shrapnel from the battle, passing old hangars and a bone yard of scrap metal, old office chairs, and broken appliances. Massive bags held some of the 20 tons of plastic ocean garbage that land on the island each year, 5 tons of which come from the bellies of albatrosses, which feed the plastic to their young, often fatally. Curious tern fledglings checked out his entourage, which tripled the islands average population of about 35 humans. Watch the burrow! called Miel Corbett, a Fish and Wildlife Services spokeswoman, as a visitor narrowly avoided stomping the underground home of the bonin petrel. About a million of the birds swoop out of their nests each night at dusk. Vestiges of the islands former life as a large naval base remain, although many have fallen into decay. Visitors have not been allowed since 2012 because of tight budgets. Reporters wrote their stories in a still-working 1970s bowling alley, just down the way from barber shop.

Disparate crises distract from Obama bid to sign off on Asia shift,"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - Barack Obama starts his last trip to Asia on Saturday as U.S. president, aiming to put a final stamp on his signature policy shift toward the Pacific but distracted by crises ranging from Brexit to the battle against Islamic State. With the clock ticking down on his presidency, Obama will attend a G20 summit in China, a visit that will underscore the challenges he has faced with a rising world power that is both an economic partner and strategic rival. His final meetings in the region with Chinese President Xi Jinping could set the tone for his White House successor, who will be elected in November and take office in January. Obama will seek to highlight his legacy of stronger ties with Southeast Asia, particularly during the first-ever U.S. presidential visit to Laos, and his success in elevating the issue of climate change on the world stage. But there will be few bright spots in talks with fellow world leaders, who are grappling with the sagging global economy, fallout from Britains vote to leave the European Union, increasing suspicion of globalization, the fight against Islamic State militants and territorial disputes in East Asia. During his past nine trips to Asia, Obama has sometimes been distracted by other international developments from the emphasis he sought to place on boosting U.S. military and economic ties to the fast-growing region, leading critics to doubt whether the U.S. commitment will last.   The latest visit coincides with the race to succeed Obama in the Nov. 8 presidential election, where Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state and co-architect of his Asia strategy, has opposed his Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, raising concerns among the 12 nations in the pact. Republican nominee Donald Trump has alarmed allies like Japan and South Korea by suggesting they should pay more for their security and even develop their own nuclear weapons to protect against the threat posed by North Korea. Derek Chollet, a former defense adviser to Obama, said one of the challenges the United States faces is reassuring  governments in Asia that the United States means what it says when it comes to rebalancing towards the region. Asia partners are suspicious that even if we really mean it, that were easily sidetracked, said Chollet, author of The Long Game, a book about Obamas foreign policy. LOW EXPECTATIONS FOR OBAMA-XI TALKS Obama will start his visit on Saturday with Chinas Xi. The leaders have forged cooperation on combating climate change and curbing Irans nuclear drive but have failed to narrow their countries main differences.  Irritants include U.S. accusations of Chinese cyber hacking, disputes over trade and Beijings pursuit of contested claims in the South China Sea. Michael Green, a top Asia adviser to former Republican President George W. Bush, said he did not expect the Obama-Xi meeting to yield much. No grand joint declaration as we saw early in the administration, no celebration - perhaps some agreements on climate change - but a pretty rough and scratchy relationship, Green said. Obama faces another tricky meeting when he holds talks with NATO ally Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, with relations strained over strategy on Syrias civil war and concerns about Erdogans crackdown on opponents after Julys failed coup. White House aides have left open the prospect of an informal encounter with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which whom Obama is sharply at odds over Syria and Ukraine. China will closely watch Obamas first meeting with brash new Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, slated for Tuesday at an East Asia summit in Laos. In July, the Philippines, with U.S. backing, won a challenge against Chinas South China Sea claims at an international arbitration court. Despite the longtime U.S.-Philippines alliance, Duterte recently insulted the U.S. ambassador, calling him a gay son of a whore. Evan Medeiros, Obamas former top Asia adviser, said such comments plus Dutertes skepticism about the U.S. relationship meant that trust needed to be rebuilt.  The White House has said Obama will not pull his punches over human rights concerns, which include thousands of extra-judicial killings since Duterte took office two months ago, according to date released this week.  Strains with Duterte could add to Obamas difficulties in forging a united front on the South China Sea with Southeast Asian partners. China may see an opportunity to drive a wedge between the United States and Philippines as Beijing seeks a bilateral arrangement with Manila over the South China Sea, Medeiros said. Western diplomats in Beijing, however, said the Chinese government had its own difficulties reading Duterte. He seems to change his mind every 24 hours, said one senior Western envoy, referring to Dutertes China policy. ",politicsNews,"September 2, 2016 ",1
Romanian hacker 'Guccifer' sentenced to 52 months in U.S. prison,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Romanian hacker nicknamed Guccifer who helped expose the existence of a private email domain Hillary Clinton used when she was U.S. secretary of state was sentenced on Thursday to 52 months in prison by a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia. Marcel Lazar, 44, who used the alias online, had pleaded guilty in May to charges including unauthorized access to a protected computer and aggravated identity theft after being extradited from Romania.  Lazars public defender, Shannon Quill, was not immediately available for comment. Lazar has said in interviews he breached Clintons private server at her home in Chappaqua, New York, but law enforcement and national security officials say that claim is meritless. Lazar is believed to have hacked into email accounts of about 100 victims between 2012 and 2014. They include prominent political figures such as former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a relative of former President George W. Bush and Sidney Blumenthal, a former Clinton White House aide and an unofficial adviser to Clinton. Clinton is now the Democratic nominee for president. Lazar leaked online memos Blumenthal sent Clinton that were addressed to her private email account, which was used during her time as secretary of state to conduct both personal and work business in lieu of a government account.  Clintons email arrangement, which became the subject of an FBI investigation, has drawn intense scrutiny from Republicans attempting to sow doubt about her honesty ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. An entity calling itself Guccifer 2.0 and claiming to be a Romanian hacker emerged in June and began taking credit for data breaches at the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. U.S. intelligence officials and cyber security experts believe Guccifer 2.0 is a front for Russian intelligence services intended to spread confusion about the hacks against the Democratic Party.

Trump's immigration pitch falls flat with Republicans near the border,"(Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps effort to clarify his position on illegal immigration during visits to both sides of the U.S.-Mexico frontier on Wednesday did little to sway moderate Republicans near the border, a dozen voters in Arizona told Reuters on Thursday. They were either unaware of his whirlwind tour or found that his uncharacteristically diplomatic demeanor during a visit with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City was overshadowed by his return to his usual fiery rhetoric when back on U.S. soil a few hours later. I hope that he does really, in his heart, have a little more compassion than what he spouts out, said Dave Mitchell, 58, of Surprise, Arizona, a self-described moderate who says he is begrudgingly planning to vote for Trump. Arizona, a reliably Republican state in past elections, could prove to be a close race in the battle between Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project, which is based on a national online opinion poll, found Trump leading Clinton by only 3 percentage points in the state as of Aug. 26.  Trumps last-minute visit on Wednesday to Mexico was designed to appeal to moderate voters, including those most affected by illegal immigration, who are worried that the real estate mogul and former reality TV star lacks the temperament to engage in international diplomacy.  Pena Nieto had on Wednesday afternoon hailed the impromptu meeting with Trump as open and constructive. Trump later referred to the Mexican leader as his friend and a wonderful president. But only hours after leaving Mexico, Trump delivered a speech in Phoenix, Arizona, in which he again emphasized his desire to build a wall along the southern border and deport millions of people who had entered the United States illegally.  Pena Nieto later rebuked Trump as a threat to his country. Trump launched his campaign last year on a promise to build a wall along the Mexican border to stop illegal immigration, and accused Mexico of sending rapists and drug dealers into the United States. Clintons campaign announced on Wednesday night it would begin running TV commercials in Arizona, a sign it sees a chance of winning there on Nov. 8. For many moderate Republicans in Arizona, Trumps efforts on Wednesday fell flat. Linda Yaeger, a 62-year-old retired Air Force officer who teaches at a community college in Glendale, said she watched Trumps appearance in Mexico on her tablet between classes. She said she had hoped Trump would take a more moderate tone after the meeting with the Mexican president, but was disappointed by his speech later that day in her home state. Being a moderate Republican means (being) an endangered species right now, Yaeger said, explaining that she felt the party had moved too far to the right.   Lois Pidde, 70, an office manager in Casa Grande, said she agreed with Trump that immigration is a problem, but opposed his proposed solutions, such as the need for a border wall or a suspension of Muslim immigration to shore up national security.  I used to be able to turn him off when he was on The Apprentice and Id like to keep it that way, she said, referring to Trumps reality TV show. She said she was likely to vote for New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate. Josh Jensen, 35, a Border Patrol agent from southeastern Arizona, said he thinks Trumps plan to build a wall is ill-conceived and is voting for Johnson too. I was thinking maybe Hillary over Trump, Jensen said. But I cant vote for either one of the two candidates. April Chase, 58, of Arizona, was aware of Trumps trip to Mexico but did not watch it. A moderate Republican, she plans to write in U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont - who lost the Democratic primary campaign to Clinton. She said she felt Trump was dishonest, so I kind of steered away from that. ",politicsNews,"September 1, 2016 ",1
Factbox: Trump's 10-point immigration plan,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - In a speech on Wednesday in Phoenix, Arizona, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump outlined his plan for reforming the U.S. immigration system. The New York businessman has made immigration a central issue of his bid for the White House, taking a harder line than his Democratic rival, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Trumps plan includes: 1. Building a wall along the border between the United States and Mexico. Trump emphasized that this would be a physical wall, albeit bolstered by technology. 2. Ending catch and release, a term often broadly used to refer to practices under which not everyone apprehended by immigration agents is necessarily deported. 3. Immediate deportation of undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes. Trump has promised to begin these deportations on his first day in office. Going forward, undocumented immigrants arrested for committing a crime would be placed into immediate deportation proceedings. 4. Blocking funding for sanctuary cities, places that limit, to differing extents and through different methods, how much they help immigration officials in the apprehension and deportation of undocumented immigrants. 5. Cancellation of executive orders and enforcement of immigration laws. This point would particularly hit two of President Barack Obamas executive actions, known by their abbreviations: DACA and DAPA. The actions gave a certain legal status to certain undocumented immigrants, such as those brought to the United States as children or those who now have American children.  6. Suspending visas to immigrants from parts of the world where screening procedures are deemed inadequate. Trump singled out Syria and Libya as two countries from which immigration would be suspended. 7. Ensuring that other countries take back their citizens when the United States moves to deport those immigrants. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that these people cannot be detained indefinitely, but without a country to which to return they often are simply released from detention. Trump said he would force the immigrants home countries to take them back. 8. Completing a biometric entry-exit visa tracking system. Many undocumented immigrants enter the country legally, and then overstay their visas. In those cases, this kind of system would be more effective than a border wall. While such a system has been discussed for years, the logistics remain a major challenge. Putting in such a system would likely require major overhauls of U.S. points of entry, such as airports and ports.  9. Making it harder for undocumented immigrants to get jobs and benefits. Trump specifically cited the E-verify system as part of this. That system allows employers to check whether their employees are legally eligible to work in the United States. Trump also mentioned ending access to benefit programs such as public housing or food stamps. 10. Serving the best interests of American workers. Trumps final point serves as something of a catch-all for his immigration proposal. But he also mentioned a few specific goals here, such as limiting immigration. He also talked about being more selective about who gets to enter the country, for example limiting immigration to people who can be financially self-sufficient. ",politicsNews,"September 1, 2016 ",1
Democrat Clinton raised more than $140 million in August: campaign,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democrat Hillary Clinton raised about $143 million in August for her presidential bid and the Democratic Party, the her campaign announced on Thursday.  Of the total, about $62 million was raised for the candidates White House run and about $81 million was raised for the Democratic National Committee and state parties. Clinton spend most of the month of August working the Democratic fundraising circuit and trying to amass a war chest to use against Republican Donald Trump.  The August hauls included a lucrative two-week swing of high-dollar events in the moneyed East Coast vacation spots of Marthas Vineyard and the Hamptons, along with star-studded luncheons in Los Angeles and gatherings with high-tech leaders in Silicon Valley. A three-day, $19 million fundraising trip to California included a stop at the home of former basketball star Magic Johnson, lunch at the home of musician Justin Timberlake and actress Jessica Biel and an afternoon event in Northern California with Apples Tim Cook.  Twenty people paid at least $200,000 each to attend a nighttime event at the estate where Laurene Powell Jobs is building a dream home designed by her late husband, Steve Jobs. Clinton has already saturated the airwaves in key states with television ads, while Trump has spent almost nothing on the general election. Trump has struggled to raise large sums of cash. Instead, much of his campaign has been self-funded, using his personal wealth to fuel his shoestring primary campaign.  But supporters of Trump have warned that a general election requires more to be spent on expensive television ads and requires outside fundraising.  Trump has not yet released his fundraising totals for the month of August. Clintons campaign has already announced plans to spend $77 million in swing state advertising before the Nov. 8 election.  Her campaign said the average donation in March was $50, a signal that she is drawing from small-dollar donors and not just those who write checks worth thousands of dollars.  Thanks to the 2.3 million people who have contributed to our campaign, we are heading into the final two months of the race with the resources we need to organize and mobilize millions of voters across the country, campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement.

Trump campaign criticizes Iran nuclear deal anew after Reuters report,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps campaign criticized the Iran nuclear deal and Democrat Hillary Clintons support for it after a Reuters report that said the United States and its negotiating partners agreed in secret to allow Iran to evade some restrictions. Retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, a Trump foreign policy adviser, said in a statement that the report showed President Barack Obama gave away the store when the agreement was sealed last year. The deeply flawed nuclear deal Hillary Clinton secretly spearheaded with Iran looks worse and worse by the day, the statement said, referring to Clintons role during Obamas first term as secretary of state. Reuters was first to report on a think tank report earlier on Thursday based on information provided by several officials of governments involved in the negotiations.

Mexico calls Trump wall plan 'outrageous' after visit,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Donald Trumps pledge to make Mexico pay for a border wall is outrageous, its government said on Thursday, one day after the Republican presidential candidate visited Mexico City for talks with President Enrique Pena Nieto. The proposal to build the wall, and to believe that Mexico could and would pay for it, is outrageous, presidential spokesman Eduardo Sanchez told local radio, after Trumps rapid, impromptu visit to Mexico on Wednesday. What I know is that Mexico will not pay a single cent if they want to build a wall on that side of the border, he added. On Twitter early on Thursday, Trump wrote, Mexico will pay for the wall! That prompted a Twitter reply from Pena Nieto later in the day: I repeat what I told you personally Mr Trump, Mexico would never pay for a wall. Trump has sparked anger in Mexico with accusations on the campaign trail that the country sends rapists and drug runners to the United States, as well as his threats to tear up trade deals and make Mexico fund his planned wall. At a news conference after their 70-minute meeting, Trump said he and Pena Nieto had not discussed who would pay for the wall he wants to prevent illegal immigrants from crossing the border. A few hours later, Pena Nieto contradicted Trump, saying he had told the American that Mexico would not foot the bill. However, Trump told a cheering crowd of supporters in Arizona later on Wednesday that Mexico would pay for the wall 100 percent. After Trump had left Mexico, Pena Nieto was at pains to stress how he had brought home to the New York businessman the offense his comments have caused, calling his proposals a threat to the country. I was very clear - in private and in public - in stressing that in Mexico we feel offended and hurt by his pronouncements about Mexicans, Pena Nieto wrote in a piece in the newspaper El Universal on Thursday entitled Why did I meet Donald Trump? In his campaign speeches, Trump has not treated us like partners, nor as allies, based on a distorted picture of Mexico and its people, he went on, saying he had told Trump future cooperation between the two nations must be based on mutual respect. Donald Trumps reaction was positive, he said. ",politicsNews,"September 1, 2016 ",1
U.S. Senate's Reid warns against postponing spending decisions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats would not agree to postponing completion of this years spending legislation until 2017, the chambers top Democrat said on Thursday, warning the majority Republicans against considering such an approach when Congress returns next week. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid spoke after some conservative groups outside Congress earlier this week said it would be better for lawmakers not to finish a government appropriations bills until early 2017, when there will be a new president who could work out a deal with a newly elected Congress. The lawmakers return to work next week from a lengthy recess with appropriations bills unfinished for the coming fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. By law, lawmakers must act by Sept. 30 to approve the spending bills, or the government shuts down, as it did for two weeks in 2013 when appropriations bills had not been enacted in time. In a conference call with reporters, Reid said he worried that were headed straight for another unnecessary government shutdown unless action is taken.  Congress could pass a stop-gap continuing resolution that would keep the government running at current spending levels until next year, postponing final appropriations decisions until then without shutting down the government. Reid said Democrats favored approving a shorter stop-gap bill that would let lawmakers return to Washington later this year - presumably after the Nov. 8 election - to finish spending bills. But we are not doing anything into next year, he said. And the Republicans should be made aware of that right now.  Reid said he had met with President Barack Obama on Wednesday, implying Obama endorsed his stance. Although Democrats are in the minority in both the Senate and House, rules requiring a supermajority for many Senate actions give Democrats significant leverage. More than two dozen conservative groups wrote to lawmakers this week saying they were worried that Congress would use what is called a lame duck session immediately after the election to tack on additional spending and corporate welfare provisions to the appropriations bills. Among other things, Congress has not been able to decide how much to spend to fight the mosquito-borne Zika virus. The Republican leadership has not announced its plans for finishing work on spending bills. Staff members for both Republican leaders in the House and Senate said they would discuss the issue next week. ",politicsNews,"September 1, 2016 ",1
Maine lawmakers to meet on embattled governor's future," (Editors note: This story contains language in the second paragraph that may offend readers) BOSTON (Reuters) - Maine legislative leaders are set to meet on Thursday to discuss whether to push for the resignation of Governor Paul LePage, a week after he left an obscenity-laden voicemail for a lawmaker who had criticized him for making racially charged comments. The meeting comes a day after LePage, a Republican who earlier in the week discussed the possibility of not finishing his term in a radio interview, said he would seek spiritual counseling but not resign after calling Democratic State Representative Drew Gattine a little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker. The Democratic speaker of the Maine House, Mark Eves, and the Republican president of Maine Senate, Michael Thibodeau, will be attending the 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT) meeting, according to their representatives, as will several lower-ranking members of the legislative leadership. The state House and Senate both adjourned in April, so the leaders would need to agree on the need for a special session before setting any votes calling for LePages resignation or censure. Earlier this year a group of lawmakers started an effort to impeach him, contending the governor overstepped his authority by threatening to withhold funds from a nonprofit group that hired a political rival, but that effort collapsed before making it to the full House. LePage has been in the national spotlight for making repeated statements blaming out-of-state black and Hispanic people for the heroin trade in Maine. He has rejected any allegations of racism, saying his sole concern is saving lives in the state. The two-term governor, whose current term extends through 2018, has apologized for the language he used in the voicemail. Gattine has joined the chorus of lawmakers calling for LePage to step down. The minority Republican leadership of the House have backed LePage, saying they accept his apology and want to move on. ",politicsNews,"September 1, 2016 ",1
Trump returns to hardline position on illegal immigration,"PHOENIX (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed on Wednesday that anyone who is in the United States illegally would be subject to deportation if he is elected, sticking with his hardline position after flirting with a softer approach. In a major speech in the border state of Arizona, Trump took a dim view of the 11 million people who crossed into the United States illegally, a week after saying many were great people who had lived in the country for years and contributed to American society. He said all people in the United States illegally would have only one route to gain legal status if Trump were to win the Nov. 8 presidential election: To return home and apply for re-entry. Our message to the world will be this: You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country, Trump said. People will know you cant just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized, he said. Those days are over. Trump again vowed that Mexico would pay for construction of a great border wall between the two countries. He spoke hours after Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto told Trump in a face-to-face meeting in Mexico City that Mexico would not pay for it. We will build a great wall along the southern border, Trump said. And Mexico will pay for the wall - 100 percent. They dont know it yet, but theyre going to pay for the wall. Trump said at a joint news conference with Pena Nieto that he and the Mexican leader did not discuss who would pay for the wall. Pena Nieto remained silent on the issue at the event, but said later on Twitter he did raise the issue. At the beginning of the conversation with Donald Trump I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall, Pena Nieto said in a tweet. Trump used the Phoenix speech to clarify his stance on illegal immigration after prevaricating on the issue last week. He returned to the hardline rhetoric that powered him to the Republican presidential nomination over 16 rivals, heartening those conservatives drawn to Trump by the issue. Ann Coulter, a conservative activist who had fretted that Trump might be softening, tweeted: I hear Churchill had a nice turn of phrase, but Trumps immigration speech is the most magnificent speech ever given. Correct The Record, an organization supporting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the Nov.8 presidential election, slammed Trump. Tonight confirmed what we knew all along - there is no softening, Correct The Record spokeswoman Elizabeth Shappell said. Trumps America First positions are aimed at rallying middle-class people who feel they have lost jobs to illegal immigrants or to the outsourcing of jobs abroad. However, he may have put himself at risk of limiting his ability to broaden his base of support to include more Hispanic-Americans and more moderate Republican voters who do not think it is possible or practical to crack down on all illegal immigrants.  In his speech, Trump emphasized that his priority would be to quickly deport those among the undocumented population who have committed serious crimes. As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities, Trump said. Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have a country.  He said he would form a commission to study which regions or countries he would suspend immigration from, saying Syria and Libya would be high on his list. This would be his way of carrying out his proposed ban on Muslims from some countries without getting into their religious affiliation. Trump said he would also establish a deportation task force to identify criminals subject to deportation, would triple the number of federal deportation officers, and increase the number of border patrol stations. Trump is trailing Clinton in opinion polls and the New York businessmans aides hoped the trip would make him look presidential and show he was willing to deal head-on with  thorny issues such as relations with Mexico. Pena Nieto said at the joint news conference with Trump in Mexico City that the many millions of Mexicans in the United States deserved respect. However, he offered only a mild rebuke of Trump for his rhetoric. The Mexican people has felt aggrieved by comments that have been made, but I was sure his interest in building a relationship is genuine, Pena Nieto said. A few dozen demonstrators gathered beneath a monument to Mexican independence in the center of the capital to protest against the visit, some holding placards emblazoned with captions such as: You are not Wall-come and Trump and Pena out.    Trump has been pilloried in Mexico since he launched his White House campaign last year. Clinton, a former secretary of state, said on Wednesday Trump could not paper over his previous harsh language against Mexico. It certainly takes more than trying to make up for more than a year of insults and insinuations by dropping in on our neighbors for a few hours and then flying home again, she told a convention of the American Legion military veterans group in Cincinnati.

Obama highlights climate progress at home before journey overseas,"HONOLULU (Reuters) - Preserving natural places will help the world adapt to warming temperatures, U.S. President Barack Obama said on Wednesday as he began a 10-day trip to stress the urgency of curbing climate change and attend a G20 meeting in China. No nation, not even one as powerful as the United States, is immune from a changing climate, Obama said after landing in Hawaii, the Pacific island state where he grew up. Obama, who is racing to cement his legacy on climate change before his presidency ends on Jan. 20, will make a rare visit to Midway Atoll on Thursday, deep inside the Papahnaumokukea Marine National Monument where he expanded protections last week. The tour leads up to a meeting in China on Saturday with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is hosting the G20 group of leading economies. Obama and Xi worked together in Paris last year to secure a global deal to cut carbon emissions and are expected to take the next steps soon to help bring that agreement into force. Native Hawaiian student Narrissa Spies said she hoped Obamas trip to Midway would inspire him. Spies, 34, went there in 2010 on a life-changing marine studies visit. I saw what my ancestors must have seen on the main Hawaiian Islands 200 years ago, said Spies, a PhD candidate now studying coral resistant to stresses like warming water. Earlier on Wednesday, Obama stopped in to a summit about the health of Lake Tahoe, the deep alpine lake in the Sierra Nevada mountains on the Nevada-California border whose average surface temperature reached an all-time recorded high last year. The challenges of conservation and combating climate change are connected, theyre linked, said Obama, who was interrupted by protesters yelling: Keep it in the ground, a campaign to limit fossil fuel production. Green groups have urged Obama not to rest on his laurels. The U.S. Supreme Court put his plan to slash carbon emissions from power plants on hold earlier this year. Were hoping that he will actually withdraw the Arctic from his five-year plan on offshore drilling, like he did with the Atlantic, because its an even worse place to drill, said marine biologist Jackie Savitz of the Oceana conservation group.

Mexico president blasts Trump's policies as 'huge threat' after meeting,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexicos president rebuked Donald Trump as a threat to his country just hours after painting a positive picture of talks the two held on Wednesday to try to defuse tensions over the U.S. presidential hopefuls anti-Mexican campaign rhetoric. President Enrique Pena Nieto had on Wednesday afternoon hailed as open and constructive the impromptu meeting he held with Trump, who later referred to the Mexican leader as his friend and a wonderful president. But in a late evening television interview, an angry-looking Pena Nieto sought to defend himself against a broad swathe of criticism for his decision to invite the Republican candidate despite his repeated verbal attacks on Mexico. His policy stances could represent a huge threat to Mexico, and I am not prepared to keep my arms crossed and do nothing, Pena Nieto said. That risk, that threat, must be confronted. I told him that is not the way to build a mutually beneficial relationship for both nations. Trumps quick acceptance of an invitation sent last Friday took Mexicos government by surprise, and his visit to Mexico City came just hours ahead of a keynote speech on immigration as he sought to close the gap on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. The real estate moguls accusations that Mexico sends rapists and drug runners to the United States, and his threats to build a border wall and tear up trade deals, have angered the government but his meeting with Pena Nieto on Wednesday gave him a chance to present himself in a more moderate light. He spoke of Mexican-Americans in glowing terms and stressed the areas of common interest between the two countries even as he stuck to his message that he would put up the wall. Pena Nieto had likened Trump to dictators Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini earlier this year. But his government said Trump understood its concerns at the meeting, making Pena Nietos tense appearance on television the more surprising. What we saw was a respectful attitude and discourse from Donald Trump, presidential spokesman Eduardo Sanchez had said earlier, arguing that progress was made on the issue of trade after prior threats by Trump to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). I think there was an advance in general, he added. Still, Trump laid out a series of tough policies to tackle illegal immigration when he delivered his speech in Phoenix, Arizona, on Wednesday night. He told a cheering crowd that Mexico would pay for the wall 100 percent and that if he wins the election anyone living illegally in the United States would be sent back to their home country and made to apply for re-entry.  That would include millions of Mexicans. Opposition politicians in Mexico rounded on Pena Nieto for hosting Trump. Instead of making him apologize, the government allowed (Trump) to complete the humiliation of the Mexicans, Ricardo Anaya, leader of the center-right opposition National Action Party, said on Twitter. Some Mexican officials also privately expressed reservations about the meeting with one former diplomat saying Pena Nieto had done Trumps campaign a favor. During a joint news conference after their meeting, Trump said he and Pena Nieto had not discussed his demand that Mexico pay for the border wall. But Pena Nieto later contradicted Trump, saying he had told the American that Mexico would not foot the bill, and he bristled during his television interview when asked why he had not made that clear at the news conference. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a Mexican government official said the two men spoke English during the meeting and that Pena Nieto clearly explained to Trump the offense his comments had caused. Hes a candidate that offended a lot of Mexicans, so thats the chemistry there was (between them), the official said. ",politicsNews,"September 1, 2016 ",1
Maine governor says will not resign amid racism flap,"(Reuters) - Maine Governor Paul LePage said on Wednesday he would not resign and was seeking spiritual advice after unleashing an obscenity-laden voicemail message on a political rival, as state lawmakers mulled whether to vote to censure the Republican. The famously combative two-term governor apologized for the second day straight to the people of Maine and to state Representative Drew Gattine after calling the Democrat a little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker in a voicemail message that has been widely circulated. I will not resign, LePage told reporters in his office in the state capital, Augusta, a day after discussing the possibility in a radio appearance. LePages angry voicemail followed an exchange with a newspaper reporter who asked about comments the governor had made blaming black and Hispanic people for the heroin trade in the Northeastern state. The reporter named Gattine as someone who had raised concerns about the comments, although both agree the Democrat never called the governor a racist. The voicemail ended with LePage urging Gattine to share it widely because I am after you. After meeting with Gattine on Wednesday, LePage said: He never called me racist. He said I made racially comments. Maybe in my mind it is semantics but in his mind after talking to him it was clear that there was a real difference. LePage, whose term runs through 2018, said he will be seeking spiritual guidance with my wife and my children. The Republican-led state Senate is still deliberating whether to call a special session to vote to censure LePage, said Majority Leader Michael Thibodeau. We cant continue to have the explosiveness that weve seen and so were in hopes that hes going to find a way to correct that, said Thibodeau, who would take over as governor if LePage stepped down. We live in a time in America when racial tensions are high and we dont need to be throwing gasoline on that fire. Republicans in the states Democratic-led House of Representatives said they accepted LePages apology and were ready to move on. But House Speaker Mark Eves, a Democrat, called for a meeting of lawmakers to discuss LePages resignation or removal from office. The governors comments today do nothing to address his increasingly erratic behavior that demonstrates he is unfit to lead, Eves said in a statement. LePage on Tuesday morning mused on stepping down, saying he was not necessarily committed to finishing his term and adding: Its one thing not to have one party behind you, its another thing not to have any party behind you. Hours later, he changed his tune, paraphrasing Mark Twain as he tweeted: The reports of my political demise are greatly exaggerated, before trying to change the subject with messages on a visit to a tissue factory. Maybe my temperament for the poor and the underdog is over the top but Ill live my life that way. Im comfortable fighting for the underdog, LePage said. Im just not a very good politician.

"Naked Donald Trump statue up for auction, could fetch $20,000","(Reuters) - A life-sized nude statue of U.S. Republican presidential contender Donald Trump is going up for auction, with profits from the sale going to an immigrant support group. Juliens Auctions said on Wednesday that the statue, called The Emperor Has No Balls, is expected to fetch $10,000 to $20,000 at the Oct. 22 auction in Los Angeles. The statue is one of a series that appeared unannounced in public spaces in New York and four other U.S. cities earlier in August. The orange-tinted likeness showed Trump with a massive belly, small fingers and some missing genitals. Most were confiscated or destroyed by local authorities and the Los Angeles statue is the only one remaining, Juliens said. The statues were created by an anonymous artists collective called INDECLINE. A portion of the auction profits will go to the National Immigration Forum, which campaigns for the rights of immigrants. Trump has pledged to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico to keep immigrants out and to deport the millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States, should he be elected. He is due to give a speech on Wednesday as he seeks to find a balance in his immigration stance.

We will build a great wall along the southern border, Trump said. And Mexico will pay for the wall - 100 percent. They dont know it yet, but theyre going to pay for the wall. Trump said at a joint news conference with Pena Nieto that he and the Mexican leader did not discuss who would pay for the wall. Pena Nieto remained silent on the issue at the event, but said later on Twitter he did raise the issue. At the beginning of the conversation with Donald Trump I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall, Pena Nieto said in a tweet. Trump used the Phoenix speech to clarify his stance on illegal immigration after prevaricating on the issue last week. He returned to the hardline rhetoric that powered him to the Republican presidential nomination over 16 rivals, heartening those conservatives drawn to Trump by the issue. Ann Coulter, a conservative activist who had fretted that Trump might be softening, tweeted: I hear Churchill had a nice turn of phrase, but Trumps immigration speech is the most magnificent speech ever given. Correct The Record, an organization supporting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the Nov.8 presidential election, slammed Trump. Tonight confirmed what we knew all along - there is no softening, Correct The Record spokeswoman Elizabeth Shappell said. Trumps America First positions are aimed at rallying middle-class people who feel they have lost jobs to illegal immigrants or to the outsourcing of jobs abroad. However, he may have put himself at risk of limiting his ability to broaden his base of support to include more Hispanic-Americans and more moderate Republican voters who do not think it is possible or practical to crack down on all illegal immigrants.  In his speech, Trump emphasized that his priority would be to quickly deport those among the undocumented population who have committed serious crimes. As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities, Trump said. Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have a country.  He said he would form a commission to study which regions or countries he would suspend immigration from, saying Syria and Libya would be high on his list. This would be his way of carrying out his proposed ban on Muslims from some countries without getting into their religious affiliation. Trump said he would also establish a deportation task force to identify criminals subject to deportation, would triple the number of federal deportation officers, and increase the number of border patrol stations. Trump is trailing Clinton in opinion polls and the New York businessmans aides hoped the trip would make him look presidential and show he was willing to deal head-on with  thorny issues such as relations with Mexico. Pena Nieto said at the joint news conference with Trump in Mexico City that the many millions of Mexicans in the United States deserved respect. However, he offered only a mild rebuke of Trump for his rhetoric. The Mexican people has felt aggrieved by comments that have been made, but I was sure his interest in building a relationship is genuine, Pena Nieto said. A few dozen demonstrators gathered beneath a monument to Mexican independence in the center of the capital to protest against the visit, some holding placards emblazoned with captions such as: You are not Wall-come and Trump and Pena out.    Trump has been pilloried in Mexico since he launched his White House campaign last year. Clinton, a former secretary of state, said on Wednesday Trump could not paper over his previous harsh language against Mexico. It certainly takes more than trying to make up for more than a year of insults and insinuations by dropping in on our neighbors for a few hours and then flying home again, she told a convention of the American Legion military veterans group in Cincinnati.

Pena Nieto told Trump Mexico won't pay for wall-Presidential spokesman,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Wednesday told Donald Trump that Mexico would not pay for the Republican presidential candidates proposed wall along the Mexico-U.S. border, contradicting Trumps assertion they didnt discuss payment. What the president said is that Mexico, as he has said on several occasions ... will not pay for that wall, presidential spokesman Eduardo Sanchez told Reuters by telephone. Trump earlier told a joint news conference with Pena Nieto after their meeting in Mexico City that the pair had discussed the wall but not who would pay for it.

U.S. Supreme Court rejects bid to reinstate North Carolina voting limits,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a bid by North Carolina to reinstate for Novembers elections several voting restrictions, including a requirement that people show identification at the polls. The eight-justice court, divided in most part 4-4, rejected a request made by Republican Governor Pat McCrory after an appeals court ruled last month that the 2013 law discriminates against minority voters. Five votes are needed for an emergency request to be granted. Were thrilled. Elections in North Carolina this fall are going to be conducted under a fair and nondiscriminatory election law scheme, said Allison Riggs, a lawyer with the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, one of the civil rights groups that challenged the law. The U.S. Justice Department, which has also been involved in fighting the law, did not immediately comment on the decision. McCrory said in a statement that the state has been denied basic voting rights already granted to more than 30 other states to protect the integrity of one person, one vote through a common-sense voter ID law. The brief order noted that three of the courts conservatives, including Chief Justice John Roberts, would have allowed the voter identification provision and limits on early voting to be in effect for the election. Justice Clarence Thomas agreed on that point, but was the only justice to say he would have also allowed a requirement blocking pre-registration of 16-year-olds to stay in place. McCrorys lawyers said the status quo should be maintained so close to the election, citing court precedent in their favor.  The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on July 29 that the law intentionally discriminated against minority voters. The same court refused to put its decision on hold for the Nov. 8 election. Critics say such laws, passed in Republican-governed states, make voting harder for minorities such as African-Americans and Hispanics, who tend to support Democrats. Backers say the laws are necessary to prevent voter fraud. The court is currently short one justice following the death of conservative Antonin Scalia in February, which likely deprived the conservative justices of the fifth vote they needed to grant the request. The high court could yet be asked to weigh in on other voting restrictions ahead of the election, with several cases pending in lower courts. ",politicsNews,"August 31, 2016 ",1

Trump and Pena Nieto emerged from about an hour of talks at the presidential palace in Mexico City to deliver statements to the news media and take questions. We did discuss the wall, we didnt discuss payment of the wall, that will be at a later date, this was a very preliminary meeting, it was an excellent meeting, Trump said. Pena Nieto, in his statement, said the border must be seen as an asset for the region. He said undocumented immigration from Mexico to the United States had dropped considerably since reaching a peak a decade ago. ",politicsNews,"August 31, 2016 ",1
"'Everything but Hillary Clinton,' France's Le Pen says, backing Trump","PARIS (Reuters) - Frances far-right National Front party leader, Marine Le Pen, voiced support for U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday, saying his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton would bring war and hardship to the world. Le Pen is a candidate in Frances April 2017 presidential election. While her increasingly popular party thrives on anti-immigration sentiment, she has been more careful in her speeches than Trump has been so as to make her party more mainstream. As far as Frances best interest is concerned its, Everything but Hillary Clinton, Le Pen told CNN in an interview hen asked which U.S. candidate she would support.  Its everything but Hillary Clinton because I believe Hillary Clinton means war, Hillary Clinton means devastation, destabilizing the world, economic choices that would be devastating for my people, geostrategic choices that would lead to global conflicts. Opinion polls see Le Pen making it to an early May run-off in Frances presidential election but losing that second round to a mainstream candidate as a majority of voters do not want her as president, despite her growing popularity. She shares with Trump a strategy that banks on presenting herself as anti-system.  What we have in common is that were not insiders, we are not taking part in the system, we depend on no one and do not take our orders from any financial institutions, she told CNN in the interview taped and released on Wednesday. Trump has been rebuked by opponents for his proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. He has faced criticism even from within his own party for comments seen as insulting women, Muslims and Mexican immigrants. ",politicsNews,"August 31, 2016 ",1
Puerto Rico oversight board appointed,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Wednesday appointed a seven-member board to oversee a financial restructuring for Puerto Rico, a majority Republican panel that some market analysts saw as favorable for bondholders of the U.S. territory, which has been crippled by a $70 billion debt crisis. Among the board members, who Obama appointed on the recommendation of legislative leaders, are Arthur Gonzalez, a Democrat and a retired bankruptcy judge who oversaw the Chapter 11 cases of Chrysler and Enron, and Carlos Garcia, a Republican and the former head of Puerto Ricos Government Development Bank who now runs private equity firm BayBoston. The other appointees are Republicans Andrew Biggs, David Skeel and Jose Carrion III, and Democrats Jose Ramon Gonzalez and Ana Matosantos. The idea of a fiscal control board, known colloquially as La Junta in Puerto Rico, is largely reviled on the island, which has a 45 percent poverty rate and whose chronic economic slump has helped spur rampant outmigration. Among the messages by protesters and graffiti artists plastered around San Juan are: Wake up! Theyre selling our homeland! and Say no to oppression.  But from a market perspective the board figures to be a positive for creditors of the island, said David Tawil, president of hedge fund Maglan Capital. He particularly cited Garcia, calling him an investor guy, very intertwined with everything that has happened up until now. And the Democrats on the panel are more moderate than expected, Height Securities analyst Daniel Hanson said in note. Jose Gonzalez, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, may be the key swing vote for creditor-friendly policies, Hanson said. Keefe Bruyette & Woods analyst Chas Tyson, in a note last week, listed Jose Gonzalez, a former Santander executive, as a potential creditor ally because of his significant experience in Puerto Ricos banking sector. The board was created under the federal law known as PROMESA, passed earlier this year, which will bring Puerto Ricos finances under federal oversight and give it the authority to restructure some of its debt. The board will be tasked with assessing and certifying annual budgets and a fiscal recovery plan presented by the islands government, as well as facilitating debt restructuring talks on the island, possibly through a bankruptcy-like process. One interesting pick is Skeel, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Though Republicans are generally seen as creditor-friendly, Skeel, a restructuring industry veteran, has repeatedly called for a broad-based restructuring in Puerto Rico.  But he has also stressed that creditor rights should be protected in such a scenario, possibly a good sign for the fate of Puerto Ricos general obligation debt. That debt is viewed as sacrosanct in municipal debt markets, but it has no legal security under bankruptcy law, which has given some GO holders reason to fret. Importantly, much of the negotiation tactics may be driven by the team of lawyers and financial advisers the board will ultimately select to represent it.      Restructuring consultant Martha Kopacz, of Phoenix Management Services, and veteran bankruptcy lawyer Richard Levin, of Jenner & Block, are among the professionals said to be lobbying to represent the board, according to people familiar with the situation.  House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, both Republicans, each chose two members of the board, while House and Senate Minority Leaders Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, Democrats, made one pick apiece. Obama chose the seventh member. ",politicsNews,"August 31, 2016 ",1
Takata parts involved in blast were shipped properly: NTSB,"(Reuters) - An initial check showed that Takata Corp 7312.T air bag parts and material involved in a deadly explosion in a truck in Texas last week were being shipped properly, a U.S. regulator said on Wednesday. A spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board said the agencys hazardous material team made the determination along with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which conducted an initial survey of shipping documents.  The NTSB said it will decide in the next few weeks whether a deeper investigation is needed into the incident, which occurred on Aug. 22 near Quemado, Texas, and left one woman dead and four other people injured.. Such a probe was called for earlier on Wednesday by two U.S. senators, Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey, both Democrats who are members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The NTSB said in a statement that it has asked to review all documents related to the incident. Initial indicators are that the materials were packaged properly. If the review of documents and other information shows cause to investigate, the NTSB will do so, it said in a statement. Takatas air bag inflators, which contain ammonium nitrate, have been linked to at least 14 deaths and more than 150 injuries and resulted in the largest vehicle recall in history. Prolonged exposure of the defective Takata inflators to hot and humid conditions has been found to cause air bags to explode with excessive force, spraying shrapnel into passenger compartments. The NTSB must investigate this incident and determine whether this company took appropriate precautions, said a statement by the senators, both Democrats. The senators noted that ammonium nitrate is also used in agricultural fertilizers and as an explosive for construction and mining industries. They said they want to protect against future incidents in highway shipments of the chemical compound. We also seek answers on what steps must be taken to ensure other towns and communities arent endangered by the shipment of ammonium nitrate on our highways, they said.          The NTSB, an independent safety investigation agency, focuses on studying accidents to determine if lessons can be learned that could lead to increased safety. The Texas Department of Public Safety is also investigating the incident, and the NTSB said it stands by to assist Texas officials upon request. ",politicsNews,"August 31, 2016 ",1
Mexican president's invitation to Trump sparks blowback,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Within minutes of Donald Trump saying he would visit Mexico, one of the front-runners to become the countrys next president hit back, saying the brash White House hopeful would not be welcome. That was just a start. Scorn rained down on both Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and the U.S. Republican presidential nominee after the two announced late on Tuesday they would meet during a brief trip by Trump to the country he has repeatedly attacked during his presidential campaign. Before it even took place, the visit was a public relations disaster for Pena Nieto as politicians and diplomats condemned him for inviting a man who has united Mexican like few others in shared disdain. Since launching his White House bid in June last year, Trump has vowed to seal off the country behind a border wall he says Mexico will pay for, tarred its migrants as rapists and drug pushers and threatened to expel millions of them, as well as saying he will revise or tear up a trade deal with Mexico if he wins office in November. Mexican cabinet ministers have called Trump ignorant and racist, and Pena Nieto earlier this year likened Trumps tilt for the top job to the rise of Adolf Hitler, so the sudden invitation to the real estate mogul was a hard sell to the public. Mr Trump may have been invited but he knows hes not welcome, presidential hopeful Margarita Zavala, wife of former president Felipe Calderon and one of the favorites to succeed Pena Nieto at the next election in 2018, said on Twitter.  Mexicans have dignity and we reject his hate speech, she added. A few dozen people gathered beneath a soaring monument to Mexican Independence in central Mexico City on Wednesday to protest the New Yorkers visit, some holding placards emblazoned with captions such as You are not Wall-come and Trump and Pena out. Trump has badmouthed Mexicans, its appalling that the president has invited him, said Abril Marquez, a 23-year-old law student holding a sign saying Trump, youre not welcome! Traditionally bitter political adversaries in Mexico have been united in their rejection of Trump, making Wednesdays hastily-arranged encounter a gamble with few obvious benefits for Pena Nieto, whose approval ratings are at all-time lows. Gang violence is at the worst levels of his term, anger over political corruption is widespread, the peso currency is near record lows and the centrist presidents personal integrity is in question after a report that he plagiarized his university thesis. A government spokesman played down the accusation, saying there were style errors in the paper. Andres Rozental, a former deputy Mexican foreign minister responsible for North America, said he was at a loss to explain the Trump visit, describing it as a big mistake by the government. Unless (Trump) comes out and makes a public statement disavowing all the things that hes said, which I doubt very much that he will do, I dont think theres really anything that Pena Nieto can get out of this, he said. Miguel Barbosa, Senate leader of the leftist opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution, who worked with Pena Nieto to push through landmark economic reforms earlier in his term, said the president was allowing himself to be used by Trump. You dont understand, Barbosa said, directing a tweet at Pena Nieto, the presence of (Trump) in Mexico at your invitation is behavior unworthy of the Mexican government. Even the man Pena Nieto picked a year ago to be his ambassador to the United States did not hold back. Nobody in the last 50 years has put Mexican-U.S. relations in such danger as Trump, Miguel Basanez, an old friend of Pena Nieto who was replaced in April as ambassador after seven months in the job, said on Twitter. I find the invitation deeply regrettable. Trump has helped stir the bad blood with comments on Twitter during his campaign. Even as he prepared for his quick visit he was in a Twitter spat with a prominent critic south of the border, Vicente Fox, another former Mexican president. ",politicsNews,"August 31, 2016 ",1
Clinton touts 'American exceptionalism' in appeal to Republicans,"CINCINNATI (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, speaking to a U.S. veterans group on Wednesday, made an open appeal to Republican and independent voters concerned about rival Donald Trumps national security credentials and his fitness for office. This election shouldnt be about ideology. Its not just about differences over policy, Clinton told an American Legion convention in Cincinnati. It truly is about who has the experience and the temperament to serve as president and commander in chief. Clinton, a former secretary of state and former U.S. senator, at times sounded like the Republican candidates Trump defeated to win his partys presidential nomination. She highlighted the United States role as a global superpower and celebrated American exceptionalism, a term frequently used by conservatives in a foreign-policy context. When we say America is exceptional ... it means that we recognize Americas unique and unparalleled ability to be a force for peace and progress, Clinton told the veterans. When America fails to lead, we leave a vacuum. She harshly rebuked Trump, accusing him of advocating a retreat from global affairs and suggesting that his calls for U.S. forces to torture terror suspects and threaten their families would make the country less safe.  The speech came on the same day that Trump was slated to meet with Mexicos president, Enrique Pena Nieto, in Mexico City in an attempt to bolster his own foreign-policy profile before delivering a speech on immigration policy Wednesday evening in Arizona. In her speech, Clinton cited the endorsements of dozens of members of the Republican foreign-policy establishment. On Wednesday, she secured another one from James Clad, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense under President George W. Bush. In a comment that has sparked criticism from many Republicans, Trump has called the U.S.-led NATO military alliance obsolete, although he has since pledged to work with NATO to defeat Islamic State. He has also vowed to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and to make Mexico pay for it. Brian Katulis, a national-security analyst at the liberal Center for American Progress think tank in Washington, said Clintons remarks were in line with a bipartisan consensus about how we can best keep America safe and secure. Trump, he said, stands outside that consensus - something the Clinton campaign has attempted to exploit in courting Republican voters concerned about his rhetoric and lack of government experience.  John Feehery, a Republican strategist in Washington, said Clintons approach could peel off some wavering voters, but could cost her support from liberals and others who are wary of overseas conflicts after protracted wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It could lose her votes on the left from folks who are tired of us blundering into any more wars, he said. Most voters think we should focus on the home front. ",politicsNews,"August 31, 2016 ",1
Maine governor's outburst tests limits of anger politics," (Editors note: This story contains language that may offend readers in the fourth paragraph) By Scott Malone BOSTON (Reuters) - Years before Donald Trump dominated the news cycle with his style of angry politics, Maine Governor Paul LePage made headlines with a similarly brash approach. Since he was elected in 2010, the Republican has told critics of his decision to skip a civil rights breakfast to kiss my butt and accused a Democratic rival of forcing budget measures on taxpayers without Vaseline. But when LePage, the second U.S. governor to endorse Trump, recently left an obscenity-laced voicemail message for a lawmaker who he believed had called him a racist, he put his career in jeopardy. LePages widely circulated verbal attack, in which he called Democratic State Representative Drew Gattine a little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker, sparked the most intense firestorm of criticism the second-term governor has seen. Even legislative leaders from his own party called him into a closed-door meeting to discuss his future. The reaction shows that not all politicians can get away with the kind of bellicose approach that helped Trump wipe out his primary rivals and win the support of angry voters who feel U.S. politicians do not care about their problems. Trump is a master of media and LePage is not. They are very different at the end of the day, said Michael Franz, chairman of the government and legal studies department at Maines Bowdoin College. Trump says he hates the media, but he works it very well. LePage just hates it. The governor infamously joked in 2013 that he would like to blow up the offices of the Portland Press Herald newspaper, which he felt treated him unfairly. On Wednesday, LePage told reporters he had met with Gattine and apologized, and that he had no plans to resign from office. Asked what might change about his governing style, LePage responded that he would no longer speak with reporters. I will no longer speak to the press ever again after today, LePage said. Im serious. Everything will be put in writing. I am tired of being caught, the gotcha moments. That came a day after LePage openly discussed the idea of stepping down in a regular monthly interview with a Maine radio station. He later backed away from his comments, and paraphrasing Mark Twain, said in a Twitter post, The reports of my political demise are greatly exaggerated. LePage endorsed Trumps run in February, shortly after New Jersey Governor Chris Christie did.  I was Donald Trump before Donald Trump became popular, LePage said at the time, saying that the wealthy New York businessman and reality TV star could be one of the greatest presidents if he sits down and puts together a good team. Trump has also praised LePage, saying that he would offer him a role in his administration if he were available. Both men describe their political styles as authentic and off-the-cuff and accuse more measured rivals of being career politicians who are out of touch with the needs of average voters. LePages brusqueness played well in Maine until recently. He won re-election in a three-way 2014 race with the support of 48 percent of voters with a wider margin of victory than the 38 percent he garnered in his first run, also a three-way race. Neil Levesque, executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics said that success, coupled with Trumps rise, could have emboldened LePage to double down on attack politics. Almost anything goes now. You can call your opponents almost anything, you can threaten them, Levesque said. This is the new norm in American politics. ",politicsNews,"August 31, 2016 ",1
Virginia Republicans seek to block governor's voting rights restoration,"(Reuters) - Virginia Republican leaders said they will file a contempt motion on Wednesday against Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe over his efforts to restore voting rights to about 206,000 felons. The motion comes the week after McAuliffe said he had restored voting rights to almost 13,000 felons on a case-by-case basis after the state Supreme Court blocked his blanket clemency effort. McAuliffes executive order was seen as a possible aid in tipping Virginia, a swing state in the Nov. 8 presidential election, in favor of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Opinion polls show her leading Republican candidate Donald Trump in the state. After a thorough legal review, it is clear that Governor McAuliffe has once again illegally suspended the Constitution of Virginia, House of Delegates Speaker William Howell said in a statement. He was joined in the 27-page motion by Senate Majority Leader Thomas Norment and four voters. The Republican lawmakers said they would ask the high court to hold McAuliffe in contempt for his bid to work around the justices July 22 ruling that he lacked the constitutional authority to restore felons political rights as a group. McAuliffe criticized the motion, saying his office has complied with the order and set up a process that was in line with it. The people who have filed it are more concerned with the impact new voters could have on Donald Trumps campaign than they are with the dignity of the people whom they continue to drag through the mud with their political lawsuits and ugly attacks, he said in a statement. McAuliffe has said his original order would move Virginia away from lifetime disenfranchisement that hits African-Americans particularly hard. Many of the convicts who benefited were African-Americans or Latinos, two groups that have voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates in the past. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, won Virginia in 2012 and 2008. ",politicsNews,"August 31, 2016 ",1
"McCain, Rubio win Republican nod in U.S. Senate races","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. senators John McCain and Marco Rubio won their partys nominations on Tuesday to seek re-election in Arizona and Florida in November, as both of the high profile politicians defeated insurgent challengers. McCain, the 2008 failed Republican presidential candidate, now faces a spirited challenge in Arizona from Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick, who has served in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2011 and wants to move to the Senate. McCain has said this years race could be the toughest of a political career spanning more than three decades. In advancing to the general election, the 80-year-old McCain handily beat ex-state Senator Kelli Ward, 47, a conservative Tea Party activist and a follower of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Like McCain, Rubio also is girding for a potentially tough challenge on Nov. 8. Also in Florida, U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz overcame a challenger - and the embarrassment of being stripped last month of her job as head of the Democratic National Committee - and will get a shot at a seventh House term in the Nov. 8 general elections. She beat law professor Tim Canova, an outspoken Wall Street critic aligned with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. The non-traditional campaigns of Trump and Sanders, who exceeded expectations in his failed Democratic White House bid, spurred speculation that other insurgent politicians could make an impact this year. But that didnt happen in either of the closely watched nominating races in Florida and Arizona. Rubio, who abandoned his presidential campaign in March, cleared the initial hurdle in his battle for a second six-year term in the U.S. Senate. He defeated novice politician Carlos Beruff, a millionaire homebuilder, who embraced Trump. U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy, a Democrat, won his partys Senate nomination on Tuesday, and is expected to give g Rubio a tough fight, especially if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton leads Trump in Florida. There is speculation that Rubio might still harbor presidential ambitions after media reports this week that he had refused to commit to serving all six years of a Senate term if he were re-elected. Trump has endorsed McCain and Rubio in their re-election bids even though he has rocky relations with both. How McCain and Rubio fare could have a big say in whether Republicans can defy expectations and maintain majority control of the Senate after Novembers election. The balance of the Senate and the outcome of the presidential election are all hanging on Florida, Rubio predicted in a fundraising appeal late on Tuesday.  Trump offended McCain and many other Republicans last year by suggesting the maverick senator was anything but a war hero because he was captured during the Vietnam War after his airplane was shot down during a bombing mission. In March, Trump ended Rubios presidential run by trouncing him in the Florida primary to cap a race in which the New York businessman taunted the first-term senator as little Marco. Rubio fired back, insulting Trump on everything from his hair color and the size of his hands to misspelled words in tweets. During their re-election efforts, both McCain and Rubio have offered support for Trump as the partys White House nominee and steered clear of attacks on that might antagonize Trumps core supporters. But they have tiptoed around Trump, mainly out of concern that his provocative comments on illegal immigration, Muslims and U.S. support for NATO could alienate moderate and independent voters in their states.

New Jersey Governor Christie vetoes minimum wage hike to $15/hr,"(Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Tuesday vetoed a bill to raise the states minimum wage to $15 per hour over the next five years. The legislation would have made New Jersey the third state to adopt a $15 per hour minimum wage, Christie said in a statement.  State voters agreed to a previous wage hike in 2013, to $8.25 from $7.25. New Jerseys rate is tied to the consumer price index and is now at $8.38, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). Despite having a constitutional mandate in place, the legislature now wants to increase the minimum wage by almost 80 percent just three years later, Christie said in a statement about his veto. Christie, a close ally of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, said the wage bill passed by Democrats, who control both houses of state legislature, failed to consider the ability of businesses to absorb the increased labor costs. Neighboring New York State, as well as California, became the first states to lift the minimum wage toward $15 earlier this year.  While Californias higher rate will be in effect statewide by 2022, New York created a two-speed system, with different timetables for New York City and nearby counties, versus the upstate regions where incomes are lower and labor markets less robust. Some cities are also stepping up to higher wage levels.     Washington, D.C.s minimum wage will reach $15 per hour by July 1, 2020, after it enacted a law this year. The citys current level is $10.50. Washington and 29 states have set minimum wages above the federal rate of $7.25 an hour, according to the NCSL.     Michele Siekerka, president of the New Jersey Business & Industry Association, praised Christies veto, saying the increase was too much too fast. Had this bill been signed, it would not only have hurt the New Jersey economy, but it would have hurt the exact workers the proponents of this policy are trying to help, she said in a statement. Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto, lead sponsor of the bill, said in a statement the wage increase is a key component to Democrats strategy to combat poverty. A substantial minimum wage increase will help lift countless families out of poverty, decrease government dependency and boost commerce by pumping more dollars back into the economy, he said.

Trump calls Democrats 'party of slavery' in minority outreach effort,"EVERETT, Washington (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump on Tuesday night called Democrats the party of slavery and praised what he called the millions of African Americans with career success, as he tries to revamp his outreach to minority voters. Trump has made much-maligned efforts to appeal to black and Hispanic voters, groups that generally support Democrats and are expected to vote heavily for Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. The Republican Party is the party of Abraham Lincoln, Trump said at a rally in Everett, Washington.  It is the Democratic Party that is the party of slavery, the party of Jim Crow and the party of opposition, he said, referring to racial segregation laws that once existed in the American South. The Republican nominee has said Democrats failed minority voters with economic policies that have not improved their job prospects, but his attempts have been criticized for painting a bleak view of the lives of all black and Hispanic Americans. Clinton last week released an ad mocking Trumps attempts to reach those groups and showing headlines about a racial discrimination lawsuit the New York real estate mogul faced in the 1970s. A prominent supporter of Trumps apologized on Tuesday for sending out a tweet that showed a cartoon image of Clinton in blackface. Trump sought to correct course in Washington state on Tuesday, saying millions of black Americans have succeeded greatly in art, science, sports and other endeavors. But we must also talk about those who have been left behind, the millions suffering in disastrous conditions in so many of our inner cities, he said. ",politicsNews,"August 31, 2016 ",1
Veteran Arizona sheriff defeats three in Republican primary,"PHOENIX (Reuters) - The Arizona sheriff famous for his tough stance on illegal immigration and keeping jail inmates in tents easily won his Republican primary on Tuesday. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who is seeking election to a seventh term as the top lawman for the area around Phoenix, won about 66 percent of the vote, well ahead of ex-police chief and three-time opponent Dan Saban, according to unofficial election results posted online by the county. Also on the Republican primary ballot were Wayne Baker, a retired deputy sheriff, and Marsha Ann Hill, an ex-sheriffs volunteer.  Arpaio is slated to face Democrat Paul Penzone, who was unopposed in his partys primary, in the general election. Penzone, a former Phoenix police officer who is expected to present a tough challenge to Arpaio in November, lost to the longtime sheriff in 2012 by six percentage points. Arpaio, 84, was expected to win his primary despite a judges request that criminal contempt charges be brought against him stemming from a 2007 racial profiling case where he was found to have violated the constitutional rights of Latino motorists.  The investigation and possible prosecution was turned over to the U.S. Justice Department last week. It was not clear when a decision would be made. Arpaio, who styles himself as Americas toughest sheriff, said his looming legal battles apparently had no effect on the primary race.  I think the people understand that they should not believe everything they hear, Arpaio told Reuters in a telephone interview. They support me as they always have and that feels good.  Saban has called on Arpaio to resign, saying the sheriff has soiled his badge and made himself ineffective as a lawman. Saban declined comment on the election results through a spokesman, adding that he would issue a statement on Wednesday morning.   Arpaio, along with three others, could face incarceration and fines if convicted of any criminal charges. Arpaio and his second-in-command, Gerard Sheridan, already have been cited and admitted to civil contempt.  The charges center on unlawful traffic stops and detentions by deputies of Latino drivers for 18 months after the judge ordered them to cease. Opponents also have targeted the profiling lawsuits high cost to the county, which will have spent an estimated $54 million on the case by next summer. ",politicsNews,"August 31, 2016 ",1
Maine governor mulls political future amid racism flap,"BOSTON (Reuters) - (Editors note: This story contains language that may offend some readers in the sixth and final paragraphs adds no comment from Gattine spokesman) Combative Maine Governor Paul LePage told a radio host on Tuesday that he was considering not finishing his term in office, amid a wave of criticism after he left a lawmaker a profanity-filled voicemail. But the two-term, Tea Party-backed Republican governor subsequently appeared to backtrack on the idea, paraphrasing Mark Twain in a tweet that read in part: The reports of my political demise are greatly exaggerated. That message came hours after he told an interviewer on Maines WVOM-FM radio that he was looking at all options, when asked if he would finish his term, which extends through 2018. LePages latest outburst came in response to a report that state Representative Drew Gattine had described him as racist for focusing on black people as bearing primary responsibility for the drug trade in the state. LePage responded to Gattine with a blistering, profanity-laced voicemail that has been widely circulated. Im not going to say that Im not going to finish it; Im not saying that I am going to finish it, LePage said on Tuesday in the radio interview, in reference to his term in office. What Im going to do right now is Im taking one step at a time. I want to meet with Mr. Gattine and then I want to meet with my team at my office and were going to look at what the proper steps are to move the state forward. In last weeks voicemail, LePage called Gattine a little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker and encouraged him to share the message publicly because I am after you. A LePage spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request to clarify the governors Twain tweet. A spokeswoman for Gattine said he would not comment until after he met LePage on Wednesday. LePage has repeatedly described himself as a less-than-polished, plain-speaking politician. Its possible it was a screw-up, said Michael Franz, chairman of the government department at Maines Bowdoin College, referring to the radio interview. My first inclination is that this is not serious and that hes just attempting to establish his regret. LePage, 67, said he had lost his temper when he was told that Gattine had described his views as racist. He told reporters he would like to engage in a duel with Gattine, a remark he later described as metaphoric. I just want to apologize to the Maine people, to Gattines family and most of all to my family, LePage said in the 15-minute interview. And we will take action. Some Democratic lawmakers have called for a special session of the legislature to censure LePage, who earlier this year fought off an impeachment effort. A half-hearted, partial apology on a radio show does not get remotely close to addressing the core issue: Maine faces serious issues and its government is not functioning, the states Democratic House leadership said in a statement on Tuesday. State Senate President Michael Thibodeau and other Republican legislative leaders convened a closed-door meeting with LePage late on Monday to discuss his future. The governor told the group he was going to talk to friends and family about what he would do next and respond to them on Tuesday, said Jim Cyr, a spokesman for Thibodeau. Controversial outbursts have marked LePages six years in office. Earlier this year, he said he did not mean to sound racist when he said drug dealers with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty were coming to the state to impregnate white girls. Last week at a news conference LePage compared Maines efforts to thwart heroin dealers to war. Look, the bad guy is the bad guy, he said. I dont care what color he is ... You try to identify the enemy and the enemy right now, the overwhelming majority of people coming in, are people of color or people of Hispanic origin. In 2013, he told a television interviewer that a political rival claims to be for the people but hes the first one to give it to the people without providing Vaseline.

Senators press Mylan on 'exorbitantly expensive' EpiPen,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Elizabeth Warren and 19 other U.S. senators voiced concern to the chief executive of Mylan NV (MYL.O) about the high cost of its EpiPen on Tuesday, calling the device used in the case of life-threatening allergies exorbitantly expensive. Mylan has been under fire for steadily raising the price of the device from about $100 in 2008 to about $600 currently. In a letter to Mylan CEO Heather Bresch, the daughter of Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the lawmakers asked the company to spell out the companys programs to provide some people with lower cost EpiPens. Such discount programs are often an industry tactic to keep costs high through a complex shell game, the letter said. Insurance companies, the government and employers still bear the burden of these excessive prices. In turn, those costs are eventually passed on to consumers in the form of higher premiums, the senators wrote. Mylan said this week it would launch the first generic version of its allergy auto-injector EpiPen for $300, half the price of the branded product, the drugmakers second step in less than a week to counter the backlash over the products steep price. It also reduced the out-of-pocket costs of EpiPen for some patients last week. EpiPen has a 94 percent market share for auto-injector devices, which jab a dose of the drug epinephrine into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions such as to peanuts, other foods and bee stings. Asked about the letter, Mylan spokeswoman Lauren Kashtan said in an email statement: We have acknowledged receipt of letters from congressional offices and intend to respond to them. Mylan has defended EpiPens high price, saying it spent hundreds of millions of dollars to improve the product since acquiring it in 2007. It has also said it recoups less than half the list price for EpiPens. In their letter, the lawmakers asked Mylan how much insurers paid for the EpiPen in 2009 and how much they pay now. They also asked how many EpiPens Mylan provided to low income, uninsured consumers and how many schools purchased EpiPens versus how many received them for free. In addition to Warren, other signatories included Senators Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee; Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat; Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat; Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, both Democrats from Rhode Island and Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat.

Trade critic Trump visits Boeing Co's backyard,"EVERETT, Washington/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump, who has made his criticism of a pending Pacific trade agreement central to his campaign, on Tuesday visited a Seattle suburb home to a large Boeing Co plane manufacturing facility that depends heavily on Asian sales. Trump vowed at his rally that he would win Washington state, even though the state tends to support Democrats and that partys nominee, Hillary Clinton, leads by large margins in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 8 election. The Republican nominee, however, presents a conundrum for the unions that represent workers at Boeing, the worlds largest aerospace company. He has courted manufacturing workers with vows to tear up trade agreements and scrap the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership.  The destruction that NAFTA started will be finished off if the Trans-Pacific Partnership is approved, Trump said on Tuesday, referring to a separate deal with Canada and Mexico reached in the 1990s. He also has vowed to renegotiate that agreement. Supporters of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) point to Boeings aircraft sales to Asia to tout the benefits of the agreement. Secretary of State John Kerry visited a nearby plant earlier this year to rally support for the pact. Manufacturing unions agree with Trump on his opposition to TPP and the export of jobs overseas, but officials said they find his track record unconvincing. The fact is that Trump has had the opportunity to bring jobs to Americans, and hes chosen to outsource them, said Larry Brown, legislative and political director for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District Lodge 751, which represents about 32,000 workers in the state, mostly at Boeing. Boeing produces some of its largest planes only miles from where Trump spoke Tuesday night. As they are assembled, the painted tails of the planes show the airlines that ordered them, and many are Asian. Major components of each plane come from overseas: South Korea, China and Europe. Over the next 20 years, Boeing projects that Asian customers will account for 40 percent of the total global jetliners market, the company said in a recent report. Trade is a huge part of the success of manufacturing in Washington, said Linda Dempsey, vice president of international economic affairs for the National Association of Manufacturers, which Boeing belongs to. They are exporting $73 billion in manufactured goods. But Trump offers a more dire outlook, arguing that only he can keep Boeing from moving those high-paying manufacturing jobs from Washington to China. Theyll start taking your business away, and you wont have much of Boeing, Trump told Seattles KIRO radio on Monday. Trump has broken with the Republican Partys traditional embrace of free trade. He has vowed to rip up the TPP and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, an existing deal with Canada and Mexico which he blames for the loss of U.S. jobs. The Republican Partys support for free trade has put it in sync with large business groups such as the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers. Tony Fratto, a former official in the administration of Republican George W. Bush, criticized Trump as out of step with the party. Trumps policies in this area are really dumb generally, but are particularly dumb for a major exporting company, said Fratto, who worked on behalf of a coalition of large companies, including Boeing, that were pushing for renewal of the Export-Import Bank. Some voters in Washington state remain divided. Kirk Hoeppner, 53, a business analyst at Boeing who lives in Granite Falls, Washington, said he will vote for Trump and he agrees with his business views. But he was not sure closer ties to other countries would hurt jobs there. Even if we ally with other countries, were still going to sell more airplanes, Hoeppner said. Corey McNally, 40, of Whidbey Island, Washington, has not decided whom he will vote for. The union members love Hillary just because theyre supposed to because shes a liberal, said McNally. And Trump, whom he called just kind of a big show, may be too late to change anything. This companys been outsourcing jobs for years, he said of Boeing. ",politicsNews,"August 30, 2016 ",1

FBI to give media some Clinton notes over email use: CNN,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI plans to hand over some of its notes from its interview with U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton regarding her use of private email while secretary of state to news outlets that requested them, CNN reported on Tuesday. However, the Federal Bureau of Investigation will not yet release other notes from the law enforcement agencys interviews with Clinton aides or turn over other investigative material, CNN said, citing unnamed sources. The materials could be released as soon as Wednesday to media companies that formally sought them under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), according to CNN. FBI representatives declined to confirm the report to Reuters.  In addition to the notes, CNN said the FBI will give the news outlets the roughly 30-page report it sent to the U.S. Department of Justice last month when it recommended against pursuing criminal charges against Clinton, who is vying for the White House in the Nov. 8 U.S. election. The Clinton campaign, which had expressed concern about selective leaks from the notes, welcomed the release.  This is something that we wanted to have happen, campaign spokeswoman Kristina Schake told CNN in an interview.   Several media outlets, including Reuters, have made FOIA requests for a summary of the interview. Such requests are often returned with sensitive information redacted.  FBI Director James Comey told Congress that the interview was not recorded, so the agency would only be able to provide a summary. ",politicsNews,"August 30, 2016 ",1
Trump booster apologizes for Clinton 'blackface' tweet,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pastor Marks Burns, a prominent supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, apologized on Tuesday for sending out a tweet that showed a cartoon image of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in blackface. Burns, an African-American who is frequently one of the warmup speakers at Trump rallies, sent out the tweet on Monday to bolster the Trump campaigns contention that Clinton is pandering for the black vote but will ignore the community if elected on Nov. 8. I aint no ways pandering to African Americans, the cartoon image says.  The tweet emerged at a time when Trump has been trying to broaden his appeal to African-American voters by saying he wants to create more jobs and make black neighborhoods safe so people can walk down the street without getting shot. After Burns began taking fire for the tweet, he deleted it and apologized for the image but not his message. Im so sorry for the offensive #Blackface image of @HillaryClinton but stand by the message that we Blacks ARE being Used by #Dems for VOTES, Burns said. ",politicsNews,"August 30, 2016 ",1

Pacific trade pact remains top issue for Obama administration,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The successful conclusion of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade talks remains the top legislative item for the United States, a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama said on Tuesday. White House National Security Council adviser Christina Segal-Knowles told a news conference ahead of the Sept. 4-5 G20 summit in China that talks on a trade pact with Europe were still in progress, despite comments from France and Germany that they were in doubt. The Asian talks are stalled in Congress and both Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump have said they would not approve the deal in its current form, if elected president in November. Segal-Knowles said corporate tax issues would be on the G20s agenda in China, although when asked whether the European Unions tax ruling on Apple Incs deal with Ireland would be discussed, she did not directly address the issue facing the company.

Democrats seek FBI probe of allegations Russia seeking to influence U.S. vote,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in Congress, including party Senate leader Harry Reid, asked the FBI to investigate concerns that the Russian government may be attempting to undermine the U.S. presidential election through cyber attacks that could include tampering with voting results. The prospect of a hostile government actively seeking to undermine our free and fair elections represents one of the gravest threats to our democracy since the Cold War, Reid said in a letter to FBI Director James Comey. Reids letter, dated Saturday, was first obtained by The New York Times and shared on its website on Monday. It was followed on Tuesday by a letter from four Democrats asking Comey to assess whether campaign officials working for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump may be colluding with Russian interests to carry out recent hacks against the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in order to interfere with the U.S. presidential election. That letter was signed by Representatives Elijah Cummings, John Conyers, Elliot Engel and Bennie Thompson, each of whom serves as the top Democrat on a different congressional committee. Republicans control both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Comey, speaking at a cyber security conference on Tuesday, declined to give details about what the Federal Bureau of Investigation was probing in connection with the political hacking but indicated the agency was closely watching what foreign countries are doing. We take very seriously any effort by any actor, ... especially nation states, that moves beyond the collection of information ... and offers the prospect of an effort to influence the conduct of affairs in our country, whether that is an election or something else, he said. The two letters follow a spate of hacking attacks targeting U.S. political databases, including some that officials and cyber security experts have blamed on hackers working for the Russian government. Kremlin officials have denied that. The FBI examined breaches in voter registration databases in Illinois and Arizona but did not specify who might have been behind it. Reid said that the threat of Russian government tampering in the election was more extensive than widely known and may include the intent to falsify official election results. He also voiced concerns about possible Russian government efforts to manipulate Trumps campaign ahead of the Nov. 8 election, and to use it as a vehicle to advance the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Poll shows Virginia lawmaker jailed in sex scandal leading mayor's race,"(Reuters) - A former Virginia politician who was jailed over a sex scandal involving a teenage girl leads a crowded field running for mayor of the states capital city, a poll showed on Tuesday.  Joe Morrissey, 58, holds a commanding lead in the Richmond mayors race with 28 percent of the vote city-wide, according to the Christopher Newport University poll. The poll showed him about 12 points ahead of the nearest of his seven competitors. Morrissey pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor in December 2014 for his relationship with a receptionist who began working in his office when she was 17. He is now married to the woman and they have two children. Morrissey, who was first elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 2007, was sentenced to six months in jail and resigned from office. He switched from Democrat to run as an independent in the special election to fill his seat. During a three-month stay in an area jail, Morrissey commuted to the state legislature on work release and also ran his re-election campaign. Morrissey stunned political pundits when he won in January 2015 while serving his jail sentence. He gave up his most recent bid to serve in the state Senate last September, citing health problems.     The poll was based on 600 live interviews with registered voters Aug. 18 through- 24 and has a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points. Morrissey also had his license to practice law revoked by the Virginia State Bar Disciplinary Board in 2003.  ",politicsNews,"August 30, 2016 ",1
Senator Grassley could be persuaded to hold hearing on Garland,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley opened the door to holding a hearing on President Obamas Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland if a majority of senators wish to do so after the Nov. 8 election, in comments posted online Tuesday. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, vowed months ago that the Senate Judiciary Committee he chairs would not act this year to consider Garlands nomination, saying the Republican-majority Senate should not act on a Court nominee until after the new president takes office early next year. But in a town hall meeting Monday in Cherokee, Iowa, Grassley indicated he could be persuaded by a large number of senators to take action in a lame duck session between the Nov. 8 election and the inauguration of the new president in January. If we have the election, and there was a majority of the Senate changed their mind about doing it in the lame duck, as opposed to January 20,  I dont feel that I could stand in the way of that. But I dont think I can promote that idea, he said in a video of his remarks posted online by the American Bridge 21st Century website, which says it is committed to holding Republicans accountable. Grassley made a similar point at the Sioux City Iowa Rotary Club, Iowas Globe Gazette reported. Garland, a federal appeals court judge, was nominated by Obama, a Democrat, on March 16 to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Republicans insist that the next president should fill the vacancy, hoping a Republican will win the White House and choose a conservative rather than the centrist Garland. But such an outcome is not assured, with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton currently leading Republican candidate Donald Trump in public opinion polls. A spokeswoman for Grassley, Beth Levine, denied he was shifting his position. She said that in Sioux City Grassley reiterated his stance that a Supreme Court nominee wouldnt be considered until after the next president is sworn inso the American people have an opportunity to weigh in on this important issue. Senate Republican leaders have vowed not to hold confirmation hearings or an up-or-down vote on any Supreme Court nominee put forward by Obama. The Leader has been clear: the next president will make this nomination, Don Stewart, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said in an email Tuesday.

Obama shortens prison sentences of 111 convicts: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama shortened the prison sentences of 111 convicts serving time for drug-related offenses in his second round of clemency grants this month, the White House said on Tuesday. Obama has now granted a total of 673 commutations during his presidency, more than the number granted by the 10 previous presidents combined, as he seeks to reform the criminal justice system, it said.  For some of the convicts, the commutations mean they will serve only half of their original prison sentences. For instance, Sly Stallone Aikens of South Carolina, serving a sentence of 360 months for using and carrying a gun during a drug trafficking crime, will now serve only 180 months. More than one-third of the 673 convicts had been serving life sentences.     Obama has made reducing the number of people serving long sentences for nonviolent drug offenses a priority. It is one of the rare issues where the president gets support from Republican lawmakers. He launched the clemency program in 2014, inviting thousands of drug offenders and others to seek early release. It was the most ambitious such program in 40 years, but it has struggled under a flood of thousands of unprocessed cases. The White House counsel, Neil Eggleston, said he expects Obama will continue to grant commutations through the end of his presidency, which ends on Jan. 20. But only legislation passed by Congress can achieve the broader reforms needed to ensure our federal sentencing system operates more fairly and effectively, Eggleston said.

EU-U.S. trade deal in doubt as France urges end to talks,"PARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - France cast serious doubt on Tuesday on the prospects of an EU free trade deal with the United States, adding to opposition within Germany and growing scepticism among Americans. Washington and Brussels are officially committed to sealing the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) before U.S. President Barack Obama leaves office in January, but their chances of doing so are being eroded by approaching elections on both sides of the Atlantic and Britains vote in June to leave the European Union. Everything is moving. In this situation its just not going to happen, said Peter van Ham, senior research fellow at Dutch think tank Clingendael and author of a paper on Tuesday called TTIP is dead, long live transatlantic trade. French Trade Minister Matthias Fekl said he would request a halt to TTIP talks at next months EU trade ministers meeting in Bratislava after German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel declared at the weekend that talks were de facto dead. Observers say both are responding to public mistrust of a deal that critics say would lower environmental and food standards and allow foreign multinationals to challenge government policies.  Stop TTIP campaigns have been particularly vocal in Germany and Austria, which supporters of TTIP say are among the countries most likely to benefit from increased U.S. trade. In the United States, Obama has promoted the accord, saying it would fuel growth. But the public mood is turning increasingly negative, with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump making attacks on international trade deals a cornerstone of his campaign, saying they have cost U.S. jobs.  His opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, has also stepped back from her previous support for free trade when she was U.S. Secretary of State, and has questioned whether trade deals hold down U.S. wages.    German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, of Gabriels Social Democratic Party (SPD), urged diplomats and business chiefs on Tuesday to counter anti-globalization sentiments that are fuelling opposition to free trade deals. Ahead of elections in France and Germany next year, politicians are keenly aware that TTIP is not a vote winner.  The Bertelsmann Foundation poll showed only 17 percent of Germans saw TTIP as a good thing in April, down from 55 percent two years earlier. There may be an economic rationale, but everyone is scrapping for votes and you lose votes if you support TTIP, Van Ham said, adding that any credit from potential free trade gains  would be two to three years away. Supporters say TTIP could boost each economy by $100 billion, creating jobs at a time of economic uncertainty as growth and consumption slow in China and emerging markets. EU leaders backed TTIP talks at a summit in June. Speaking to reporters in Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest admitted significant aspects of the deal were unresolved, but said U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman would travel to Europe in an effort to push the talks forward. I anticipate that when he travels to Europe in mid-September that theyll be engaged in substantive discussions and hopefully will be able to make some additional progress, Earnest said. Three years of negotiations have failed to resolve multiple differences, however, including over public procurement and rules to protect foods from particular regions, such as Parma ham, which the EU wants, and greater access to services and for its agricultural products, as demanded by the United States. Practically theres no real change. Its been stuck for the better part of two years, said Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of Brussels-based think tank ECIPE. EU trade chief Cecelia Malmstrom told journalists  negotiations had not failed and that many EU countries had said they still backed TTIP. They included Italy, whose trade and industry minister said it was essential for Italian exporters that the negotiations bore fruit. Germanys Gabriel is the chairman of the SPD who share power with Chancellor Angela Merkels conservatives. Merkel backs the talks and her spokesman insisted on Monday that they should continue.   Malmstrom added that it made no sense to suspend talks in September because the two sides could still make advances in regulatory cooperation, agreeing standards that are important to industries such as the auto sector, and that could be picked up by Obamas successor even if a deal was not sealed this year. The more work we have done, the easier it is to resume, she said before a planned video conference with Froman.  Froman has said Britains EU exit will affect TTIP because Britain consumes about a quarter of U.S. exports to the bloc. Trade analysts say that Washington may be preparing for the end of trade talks, which typically conclude with each side holding the other responsible for failure.  President Francois Hollande told ambassadors on Tuesday that talks were bogged down and unbalanced and it was an illusion to imagine that a deal could be sealed during Obamas term. Very soon you end in a blame game, said Lee-Makiyama. But trade negotiations never really die. They just go into a stock-taking phase. ",politicsNews,"August 30, 2016 ",1
Special Report: Why an emblematic American city has turned to Trump," MUNCIE, Indiana (Reuters) - One night a month, retired auto workers shuffle into a former elementary school classroom here to discuss their legal fight against the company that cancelled their health care benefits seven years ago.  But the conversation often turns quickly to presidential politics.  It can get pretty heated, says Gerald Poor, the groups 77-year-old president, of their political discussions. I call it to order if it gets out of hand.  Their anger is understandable. The group is a remnant of a once-powerful United Auto Workers union local, which at its peak in the 1960s represented over 5,000 workers who made transmissions in Muncie for BorgWarner Inc, the global auto parts maker. An American flag drapes the wall at one end of the room, portraits of former labor bosses line the other, salvaged from a union hall that had its own baseball field.  For this group of mostly white, working-class men, the last two decades have brought much loss. In this election  with the victory of the populist Donald Trump as the Republican Party nominee and the strong run by the populist Bernie Sanders for the Democratic Party crown  many say they feel theyre finally being heard again.  Working-class white men were once a force to be reckoned with in American politics. Many here speak wistfully of how John F. Kennedy stopped at BorgWarner to talk to workers when he campaigned in 1960. For these men, this years election is a rare taste of the clout they once took for granted.  In the primary, Trump received the most votes of any candidate in either party in Delaware County, which encompasses Muncie. Just over 52 percent of Republican voters went for Trump. Democrats picked Sanders over Hillary Clinton by an even wider margin.  Candidates in the past made a lot of promises to the working class in this country and failed to follow through with it, says 66-year-old Bruce Reynolds, who followed his father and grandfather into a career at BorgWarner.  Gazing through the rusted chain link fence that encircles the sprawling, abandoned factory, where he notes with precision that he worked for 32 and a half years, he says hes still skeptical of both sides promises.  Neither Trump nor Clinton was his first choice. Reynolds and his wife voted for Sanders in the primary, he says. Among other things, they couldnt support Clinton: Shes the wife of former President Bill Clinton, who signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which many here blame for Muncies economic decline. They were uneasy with the often fiery rhetoric of Trump, the other sides top candidate.  Yet both plan to vote for Trump in November, and Reynolds says theyve grown comfortable with the choice.  I know, it sounds like were confused, he says. But theyre not.  Like many Trump supporters, he glides over the unappealing aspects of the candidates message to lock onto those that he likes. For Reynolds, its the hope of bringing back jobs for his children, some of whom still struggle to find decent work.  Trumps gloomy world view is often dismissed as hyperbole, such as when he described crime and collapsed economies in Americas cities at the Republican National Convention. But for someone in Muncie, thats not far off reality.  An analysis by Reuters found Delaware County is an extreme example of the declining fortunes of Americas white working-class men.  In 2000, white men with less than a college degree accounted for about three-quarters of all white men living in the county. By 2014, their proportion had dropped by about 5 percentage points, according to the US Census Bureau. But while this groups share of the population held relatively steady, the earnings of white men with full-time jobs had fallen dramatically.  In 2000, 47 percent of white men working full time were in the bottom third of earners, with incomes of $50,000 or less, based on 2015 dollars. By 2014, 60 percent of them were in the bottom third.  Meanwhile, the percentage of white men in full-time jobs making between $50,000 and $100,000 dropped from 43 percent to 32 percent. And the percentage in the ranks of earners above $100,000 slipped from 11 percent to 8 percent.  In essence, white men in Muncie have slid down from every rung of the economic ladder. They have clustered at the bottom, poorer and more isolated than ever before, even as the overall U.S. economy has grown and globalized.  The same trend is visible in faded industrial pockets from New Jersey and upstate New York to Alabama and Kentucky.  According to the data, in about 1,800 counties across the United Statesnearly 60 percent of those where data is availablethe share of white men in the lowest group of earners has grown over this period. The trend is particularly pronounced in the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana.  Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at New York Universitys Stern School of Business, studies how people adopt their political beliefs. Trump is the first candidate to speak toand speak forworking-class white men in a long time, Haidt says. That separates him from the last two Republican nominees. Mitt Romney, who lost in 2012, didnt do that, and John McCain didnt particularly reach out to that constituency in 2008.  As for Trumps extreme positions and outright falsehoods, Haidt notes, If your hero says things that are untrue, youll cut him slack.  Muncie was once the epitome of Americas muscular manufacturing economy. After natural gas was discovered here late in the 19th century, the city attracted dozens of energy-intensive glass manufacturers, most notably Ball Corp, which built sprawling factories that churned out millions of mason jars.  The auto industry followed, and Muncie became a hub for transmission making. The term Muncie transmission is still used by hot rod enthusiasts when talking about gearboxes produced here by General Motors Corp in the 1960s. One particularly powerful version is the rock crusher, used in Corvettes and other muscle cars.  BorgWarner, based in Auburn Hills, Michigan, has even deeper roots in Muncie than GM. Warner Gear was founded here in 1901 and merged with other businesses to create what became BorgWarner in the late 1920s. Many former workers here still call it Warner Gear.  In the 1920s, a husband-and-wife team of sociologists picked the city to study the values in a typical American community. They called it Middletown, to conceal the identity of a place they felt was emblematic of the country as a whole. Muncie residents soon figured out it was all about them.  The Center for Middletown Studiesat Ball State Universityhas continued the work, compiling oral histories and, in recent years, focused on the devastation of deindustrialization. James Connolly, a history professor who runs the center, says that more than anything else, Muncies working-class white men feel a loss of power. When the big factories were humming, the unions were an unstoppable forcenot just for getting good paychecks and lush benefits, but a voice in almost everything else.  To illustrate this power, he cites a locally famous episode from the 1960s, when waitresses at a big downtown hotel went on strike for higher wages.  A group of police got rough and tried to break up the pickets, says Connolly. A local union leaderwho had nothing to do with the waitresses, other than knowing about them through community connectionscalled the then-mayor, who was visiting Washington, and ordered him home to intervene. The mayor returned and the police backed off.  The strikers werent union membersbut there was a system of connections that gave them a sense of control, says Connolly. With the decline of the unions, working-class people feel like theyve been robbed of that voice.  And yet unions, which were unable to prevent the factory closures that ravaged the city, are often viewed just as suspiciously here as most national politicians are. That tension is visible at the old school where the BorgWarner retirees meet.  The Muncie Delaware County Senior Center was created to give retirees from the big factoriesparticularly mena place to go for companionship and activities. One recent day, the room the BorgWarner retirees use was filled with seniors learning line dancing.  Some people dont like the photos of the union leaders, says Jim Shields, a janitor, motioning toward the 10 portraits that adorn the front of the room. They feel the images carry an implicitly political, pro-union message. So, there was a fuss the last time the building was used as a polling station, he said. We had complaints. Now, when the BorgWarner retiree group isnt meeting, Shields carefully drapes a long bolt of fabric over the pictures to conceal them.  Michael Hicks, a Ball State economist who studies manufacturing, says a mix of exasperation with unions and the political elite created the perfect opening for Trump. Its always easier to blame a larger force for your problems, whether thats Mexicans or greedy factory owners, he says. But these people arent stupid. They know the jobs arent coming back. The bigger concern for many of them, he says, is what will happen to their children.  The Reynolds family is a good example. Bruce Reynoldss oldest son, Bruce Jr, is a Baptist pastor and is supporting Trump, albeit reluctantly. I dont think any of them can fix it, Bruce Jr says of the fallout he sees from economic hardship in his congregation, from growing drug addiction to broken families.  Reynoldss second son, Robert, followed his father into BorgWarner after high school. That job didnt last. After just four years, he was laid off in 1994 during a wave of downsizing. He and his father say it was a trauma from which he never fully recovered.  I make $8 an hour less now than I made 21 years ago, says Robert, who enthusiastically backs Trump. After a series of low-paying jobs, including a stint at Wal-Mart and as a manager of a video store, he now works overnight shifts at a warehouse for $18 an hour. He likes the job, he says, although the company recently cut three paid holidays, including the Fourth of July.  Robert concedes that he finds the Republican candidates approach to foreign policy worrisome. You wonder if something will upset him and hell declare war, he says. That would be awful. He also doesnt like how race and immigration has become a theme in the campaign. This country was built on bring us your tired, your poorI think we should honor what our forefathers built, he says.  But he also doesnt believe Trumps message is racist. I think hes looking at all the illegal activity going on in the U.S. and how it affects the job market, he says. Hes just not very tactful in how he expresses this. Meanwhile, Trumps promise to restore the economy is the draw.  To be sure, Muncie has retained some of its smaller factories, and other jobs have come in, including a call center that tracks down delinquent student loans and a Caterpillar Inc locomotive factory that moved into an old plant. But none of these are unionized, and the wages and benefits arent as high as the old places offered.  One frustration for locals is that the statistical measures of the economy dont seem to reflect what they see around them. Muncies jobless rate is 5.7 percent, less than one percentage point higher than the national rate of 4.9 percent or Indianas 4.6 percent.  But the impact of deindustrializationincluding the exodus of over 10,000 factory jobs since 1970 in a city of only 70,000 peopleis visible almost everywhere.  Most of the departing companies tore down their factories, leaving lots strewn with weeds and rubble. BorgWarner left a handful of structuresincluding a 1.2 million-square-foot sprawl of red brick and steel near the edge of town.  The city, especially the once-thriving white working-class neighborhoods on the south side, is now dotted with over 2,000 abandoned houses. Some cant be occupied because they were contaminated by chemicals left behind by meth labs.  Meanwhile, the FBI recently opened a probe of the city government, which appears to be focused on possible corruption in its blight clearing program and the sanitation district. The FBI wouldnt comment on the investigation, and Mayor Dennis Tyler said he cant talk about it. There have been no indictments in the case, and its possible no charges will result.  Mayor Tyler, a Democrat, notes the jobless rate stood just under 10 percent four years ago, when he took office, so theres been improvement. But he understands working-class frustration.  They feel theyve intentionally been left behind by trade agreements this country imposed on them over the last 25 years, says Tyler.  Trumps appeal here isnt restricted to working-class white men. Another local supporter is Todd Murray, president and CEO of family-owned Mursix Corp, which makes auto parts including tiny switches that go inside door locks and interior lights. His company has grown rapidly in recent years and now employs over 300 people.  Murray says he knows some of Trumps trade proposalssuch as putting hefty tariffs on goods from Mexico and Chinacould hit his own business. He exports 60 percent of his output, mostly to Mexico, and operates his own small plant in China. But he insists hes not smart enough to know how that would all shake out. He still strongly favors the Republican standard bearer, who he sees as more pro-business.  But the economy alone doesnt explain Trumps appeal. Another family with deep roots at BorgWarner is the Lephart clan. At one point in the 1950s and 1960s, the patriarch and nine of his sons worked there, a fact immortalized in the company magazine by a photo of the group posed on a tall step ladder, each holding a lunch bucket, except for the brother at the top, who holds the family dog.  David Lephart, whose father is one of the nine brothers, avoided the decline entirely through shrewd job-hopping and retrainingbut hes still a Trump supporter. He commutes to a UAW job as a pipefitter at a GM plant in Marion, Indiana. He earns about $100,000 a year, with overtime, he says, and has put both of his children through college.  The 58-year-old says one thing that influenced his transition from Democrat to Republican was talking to his children, whom he describes as part of the business world. His son is now a stockbroker in Indianapolis.  For the first half of my life, I thought Democrat was the only way to be, Lephart says. Theres this belief that you cant be Republican and unionbut I dont believe that any more.  ",politicsNews,"August 30, 2016 ",1
California lawmakers pass rape bill inspired by Stanford case," LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California lawmakers, responding to outrage over the six-month jail term given to a former Stanford University swimmer after his conviction for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman, passed legislation on Monday closing a loophole that allowed the sentence.  The bill now goes to Democratic Governor Jerry Brown for his approval. He has not indicated whether he will sign it into law.  Trump hovers over McCain, Rubio senate races U.S. job market 'very close' to full strength: Fed's Fischer North Carolina, Florida brace for brewing tropical storms The measure was introduced in response to the sentence given to 20-year-old Brock Turner by Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky in June, which was widely condemned as too lenient.  Prosecutors had asked that Turner be given six years in state prison. He is scheduled to be released on Friday from jail in Northern California.  Sexually assaulting an unconscious or intoxicated victim is a terrible crime and our laws need to reflect that, Democratic Assemblyman Bill Dodd, a co-author of the legislation, said in a written statement following its passage.  Turner was convicted of assault with intent to commit rape, penetration of an intoxicated person and penetration of an unconscious person in the January 2015 attack. Under California law, those charges are not considered rape because they did not involve penile penetration.  The uproar over the sentence, fueled in part by the victims harrowing letter in which she detailed the assault in graphic terms, comes amid growing outrage over sexual assault on U.S. college campuses.  This bill is about more than sentencing, its about supporting victims and changing the culture on our college campuses to help prevent future crimes, Dodd said.  The case has also led to efforts to remove Persky from the bench. Earlier this month, the judge asked for a transfer to civil court.  According to the legislators, current California law calls for a mandatory prison term in cases of rape or sexual assault where force is used, but not when the victim is unconscious or severely intoxicated and thus unable to resist.  The bill, which faced no serious opposition in the Democratic-controlled legislature, would eliminate a judges discretion to sentence defendants convicted of such crimes to probation. Under its provisions, Turner would have faced a minimum of three years behind bars.  ",politicsNews,"August 29, 2016 ",1
"U.S., India sign military logistics agreement","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and India signed an agreement on Monday governing the use of each others land, air and naval bases for repair and resupply, a step toward building defense ties as they seek to counter the growing maritime assertiveness of China. The agreement, a relatively mundane one concerning day-to-day military logistics, is nonetheless a milestone in the U.S.-India defense relationship because of the outsized political importance it had taken on in India, where it had touched on domestic sensitivities, experts said.  The signing of the agreement will make the logistics of joint operations so much easier and so much more efficient, U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in a news briefing with Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar. The agreement will allow the Indian and U.S. navies to have an easier time supporting each other in joint operations and exercises and when providing humanitarian assistance, Parrikar said. Washingtons desire for deeper security cooperation with India had been complicated without the signing of the logistics agreement as well as two other pacts that would allow for secure communications and the exchange of nautical and other data. The agreements are considered routine between the United States and its other defense partners. But India has had concerns such an agreement would commit it to hosting U.S. troops at its bases, or draw it into a military alliance with the United States and undermine its traditional autonomy. Carter and Parrikar reached an agreement in principle in April, but had yet to finalize the details. Carter has made closer military ties with India a priority, and established a special unit within the Pentagon last year to promote cooperation with that country. Parrikars visit to Washington this week marks the sixth interaction between the two top defense officials. The signing of the logistics agreement indicates the priority the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi places on a closer defense relationship with the United States, said Benjamin Schwartz, until last year the India country director at the Pentagon.  For years, there has been tremendous misinformation put out into the Indian press about these agreements, said Schwartz, now with the U.S.-India Business Council, which promotes trade ties between the two countries. What the signing of this shows is that the Modi government is willing to take and suffer the short-term political criticism of signing these things for the longer-term benefit of building the defense relationship with the United States. Both Carter and Parrikar went to pains on Monday to make clear that the logistics agreement did not allow for basing of U.S. troops in India. Its not a basing agreement of any kind, Carter said. The debate over the logistics agreement had served as a vehicle for the distrust some of Indias political class has towards the United States, said Shane Mason, a research associate at the Stimson Center. The United States had previously imposed sanctions on India related to its 1998 nuclear test, although the sanctions were eased later. From the U.S. perspective this was kind of a low hanging fruit, Mason said. We have logistic support agreements with many, many other countries and in most cases its a relatively uncontroversial thing. The U.S. military has made clear it wants to do more with India, especially in countering China, which U.S. officials say is risking stoking conflict through its claims in the South China Sea, a vital trade waterway. Without naming China, both Carter and Parrikar mentioned the importance of the free flow of trade to both countries. India and the United States have a shared interest in freedom of navigation and overflight and unimpeded commerce as part of rule-based order in (the) Indo-Pacific, Parrikar said. China hoped cooperation between India and the United States would be constructive and positive for the regions peace and stability and development, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters at a regular briefing on Tuesday. So, we look favorably on this sort of normal relationship between India and the United States, Hua said. ",politicsNews,"August 29, 2016 ",1
Exclusive: Six U.S. senators urge Obama to prioritize cyber crime at G20 summit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Six U.S. senators have urged President Barack Obama to prioritize cyber crime at this weekends Group of 20 summit in China, in the wake of the theft of $81 million from Bangladeshs central bank, according to a letter obtained by Reuters. In the letter sent to the White House ahead of the Sept. 4-5 summit, Sherrod Brown, a senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, and five other Democratic senators say they want the U.S. president to press leaders from the worlds 20 biggest economies to commit in joint communiques to a coordinated strategy to combat cyber-crime at critical financial institutions. The letter, dated Monday, suggests that concern among U.S. lawmakers is growing over the February incident in which hackers breached Bangladesh Banks systems and used the SWIFT banking network to request nearly $1 billion from an account held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Some of the dozens of orders were filled, with much of the lost $81 million disappearing into Philippines casinos - prompting months of international finger-pointing, an ongoing investigation, and several requests from members of Congress for answers from the Fed and from SWIFT, the secure messaging service that banks use to transfer money around the world. Our financial institutions are connected in order to facilitate global commerce, but cyber criminals - whether independent or state-sponsored - imperil this international system in a way few threats have, the senators, headed by Gary Peters of Michigan, wrote in the letter to Obama. We strongly urge you to work with your counterparts and prioritize this discussion at the G20 leaders level in September, it said of the summit to be held in Hangzhou, China, adding that executive leadership circles across the globe needed to pay more attention to the risks. A senator in the Philippines has said Chinese hackers were likely to have pulled off the Bangladesh Bank heist, citing a network of Chinese people involved in the routing of the stolen funds through Manila. Beijing has dismissed the suggestion. Copies of the letter from the U.S. senators were also sent to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. OBAMA-XI TALKS The other senators signing the letter were Mark Warner and Martin Heinrich, both members of the Senates Select Committee on Intelligence; Kirsten Gillibrand and Debbie Stabenow, the ranking Democrat on the Senates Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. The White House expects G20 members at the summit to affirm their commitment to cooperate to fight cybercrime and to enhance confidence and trust in the digital economy, a senior administration official said. Asked generally about cyber security on Monday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at a press conference: I would anticipate that this issue more generally will be on the agenda when Obama meets Chinese President Xi Jinping, the G20 summit host, later this week.  At a November summit, the G20 pledged not to conduct economically motivated cyber espionage, an agreement intended to reduce the estimated hundreds of billions of dollars worth of commercial trade secrets that are stolen by foreign governments seeking to benefit industry in their own countries.  Since then, the Bangladesh Bank attack and others that have emerged are only some of the threats posed by cyber criminals, the senators wrote. World regulators should erect more robust defenses and collaborative systems to prevent and mitigate the impact of successful attacks, the letter said, noting that steps already taken by SWIFT are not enough. Bangladesh said it supported raising the issue at G20. In most cases, cyber attacks and crimes take place from outside the country, said Zunaid Ahmed Palak, a junior government minister for information and communications technology.  So while addressing fast growing cyber attacks, there should be a coordinated approach involving global stakeholders.  The Fed and other U.S. regulators said in a letter last week they were focused on cyber risks and controls at banks in the wake of the Bangladesh incident, though they offered few specifics.  Peters, a member of the Senates Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, told Reuters he is considering requesting a committee hearing on the heist. I am concerned about the response and what steps have been taken to make sure it doesnt happen again, he said in an interview. You just need more collaboration and sharing of information... because often times all these entities arent talking to each other.

Clinton aide Abedin leaves husband Weiner after sexting report,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Huma Abedin, one of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintons top aides, said on Monday that she was separating from her husband, Anthony Weiner, after a sex scandal similar to an earlier incident that led him to resign from the U.S. Congress. After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband, Huma Abedin said in a statement.  Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy, Abedin added. Abedins announcement follows a New York Post report late Sunday that Weiner recently sent photos of his boxer-brief-clad genitals  one while he was in bed with their toddler son  via Twitter to another woman. The photos were part of a months-long exchange between Weiner and the woman and many of the messages were sexual in nature, according to the Post report. Weiner resigned in June 2011 from Congress, where he represented a New York City district, followed a sexting scandal in which he accidentally posted an explicit photo of himself on his public Twitter timeline instead of via a direct message to a woman, as he had intended. When Weiner made a second unsuccessful run for New York City mayor, explicit photos surfaced in July 2013 that he had recently sent under the pseudonym Carlos Danger to a young woman in Indiana. Weiner said he had undergone therapy after the first sexting scandal, according to media reports. In recent months, he has taken care of the couples toddler son. Abedin often travels with the Clinton campaign. Clintons Republican rival, Donald Trump, said in a statement, Huma is making a very wise decision. I know Anthony Weiner well, and she will be far better off without him. Abedin first worked for Clinton in the 1990s as an intern when Clinton was first lady. She was a personal aide to Clinton during her successful 2000 campaign for U.S. Senate. Abedin worked on Clintons first, unsuccessful White House bid in 2008 and served as her deputy chief of staff at the U.S. State Department. She is now the vice chair of Clintons presidential campaign.  Weiner served in Congress, representing his district in New York City from 1999 to 2011. His first unsuccessful run for New York mayor was in 2005. ",politicsNews,"August 29, 2016 ",1
FBI detects breaches against two state voter systems,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Bureau of Investigation has found breaches in Illinois and Arizonas voter registration databases and is urging states to increase computer security ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election, according to a U.S. official familiar with the probe. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Monday that investigators were also seeking evidence of whether other states may have been targeted. The FBI warning in an Aug. 18 flash alert from the agencys Cyber Division did not identify the intruders or the two states targeted. Reuters obtained a copy of the document after Yahoo News first reported the story Monday. Accessing information in a voter database, much of which is publicly accessible, does not necessarily suggest an effort to manipulate the votes themselves. When registering, voters typically provide their names, home addresses, drivers license or identification numbers, and party affiliations.  But U.S. intelligence officials have become increasingly worried that hackers sponsored by Russia or other countries may attempt to disrupt the presidential election.  Officials and cyber security experts say recent breaches at the Democratic National Committee and elsewhere in the Democratic Party were likely carried out by people within the Russian government. Kremlin officials have denied that.  An FBI spokeswoman would not comment on the alerts but said the agency routinely advises on various cyber threat indicators observed during the course of our investigations. The intrusions come amid repeated unsubstantiated claims by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that the U.S. election system is rigged. Trump has cited emails leaked from the DNC that indicated the party leadership favored Hillary Clinton over rival candidate Bernie Sanders as reason to cast doubt on the electoral process in general. David Kennedy, chief executive officer of information security consulting company TrustedSec, said the attacks referenced in the FBI alert appeared to be largely exploratory and not especially sophisticated. It could be a precursor to a larger attack, he added. Citing a state election board official, Yahoo News said the Illinois voter registration system was shut down for 10 days in late July after hackers downloaded personal data on up to 200,000 voters. State voter systems are often targeted by hackers, and 200,000 is a relatively small number compared to other recent incidents. An independent computer security researcher uncovered in December of last year a database on 191 million voters that was exposed on the open Internet due to an incorrect configuration. The Arizona attack was more limited and involved introducing malicious software into one state employees computer, said Matt Roberts, communications director for the Arizona secretary of states office.  That office publicly reported a cyber incident in June after being contacted by the FBI, which led to it temporarily shutting down its election site to deal with the potential threat.  Roberts said he was uncertain if the FBI advisory was in reference to that same June incident, during which investigators found no evidence of any data exfiltration. In that episode, the FBI told Arizona officials the hackers were believed to be Russian and described it as an eight out of 10 on a threat severity scale, Roberts said. Arizona will hold Republican and Democratic primaries for congressional races on Tuesday.     ",politicsNews,"August 29, 2016 ",1
California lawmakers send governor bill authorizing farmworker overtime,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California would become the first U.S. state to require farmers to pay overtime to field workers and fruit pickers under a bill approved by the legislature on Monday and sent to Democratic Governor Jerry Brown for his approval. The bill, which passed on a mostly party-line vote, would phase in overtime pay for farmworkers from 2019 to 2022. Small farms that employ 25 or fewer workers would have an additional three years to phase in the pay. If signed into law by Brown, California, the largest U.S. agricultural producer, would the first state in the country to require farmers to pay overtime to laborers who work more than eight hours a day or 40 hours a week. The governor has not said if he will sign the measure. The bill is the culmination of decades of lobbying and pressure by the United Farmworkers Union. The Democratic-controlled legislature rejected a version of the same bill earlier this year, but supporters amended it to phase in the overtime rules more slowly. Opponents said that requiring farmers to pay overtime could damage the states agricultural economy, where workers toil up to 60 hours a week during the harvest season but can go for months without pay other times of the year. They predicted that farmers would be forced to cut workers hours to just 40 hours a week to avoid having to pay time-and-a-half or double-time overtime. Supporters, mostly Democrats, said the issue was one of fairness to farmworkers, who are among the few U.S. hourly workers not paid overtime. For me, it is a vote about my conscience, said Democratic Assemblyman Eduardo Garcia. We will be improving the lives of people. ",politicsNews,"August 29, 2016 ",1
European Commission says 'ball still rolling' on trade deal with U.S.,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Unions executive said on Monday it had a unanimous mandate from the blocs 28 members to finalize negotiations on a free trade deal with the United States, a day after Germanys economy minister said the talks had de facto failed. Sigmar Gabriel of Germany, the EUs biggest economy, said on Sunday that negotiations over the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) had failed because Europe rejected some U.S. demands. Asked to comment on Gabriels remarks, a European Commission spokesman said: The ball is still rolling on TTIP. Although trade talks take time, the ball is rolling right now and the Commission is making steady progress in the ongoing TTIP negotiations, Margaritis Schinas told a news conference. The White House also disputed Gabriels contention, saying it was still aiming to reach a deal by the end of the year. Its going to require the resolution of some pretty thorny negotiations, but the president and his team are committed to doing that, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters in Washington. In Berlin, Germanys leading industry associations were critical of Gabriels remarks and urged the German government to show greater commitment to free trade deals. The head of industry association BDI, Ulrich Grillo, said it was astonishing that Gabriel, who is also vice chancellor and head of the co-governing Social Democrats, had declared the TTIP talks a failure when negotiations were still going on. Top officials of other industry associations such as VDMA and the Auto Industry Association VDA also spoke out against Gabriels comments, which highlighted growing divisions within Chancellor Angela Merkels ruling coalition ahead of next years elections.   Three years of negotiations have failed to resolve multiple differences, including over food and environmental safety, with critics saying the pact would hand too much power to big multinationals at the expense of consumers and workers. Backers of a sweeping U.S.-EU free trade deal see it bringing economic gains on both sides of the Atlantic. EU trade ministers will discuss the issue in Bratislava on Sept. 22. Schinas said the Commission was still ready to finalize the deal by the end of the year but not at the expense of Europes safety, health, social and data protection standards, or our cultural diversity. Commenting separately on Gabriels remarks, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius said he believed arriving at a deal would benefit both the EU and the United States. It would be better for all sides to agree, he said. Of course, not at an expense of our interests. We have to defend our interests, but we also have to negotiate and conclude this agreement. It would be a big boost for economies, jobs, trade. Britains June vote to leave the EU has further clouded the picture, although Schinas said Brussels was still negotiating on behalf of all 28 members of the bloc, including London.

Obama to meet Turkey's Erdogan in China on September 4,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama will have a bilateral meeting with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan during the G20 summit in China next month and is likely to have at least an informal talk with Russias Vladimir Putin, the White House said on Monday.   Obama wants to talk with Erdogan about events in Turkey after Julys attempted coup, the military campaign against Islamic State, and how to promote stability in Syria, Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes told reporters.  The White House said it opposes Turkeys push into areas in northern Syria controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, an opposition group the Obama administration supports, as it stands to erode the united front against Islamic State.  The Obama-Erdogan meeting is scheduled for Sunday. It was not certain whether Obama would hold a formal meeting with the Russian president during the G20 summit of the worlds biggest economies, which runs Sept 4-5. But the two leaders often speak on the margins of such summits, Rhodes said.  We usually try to find an opportunity for the two leaders to try to spend some time together, usually to focus on Syria and Ukraine, Rhodes said. The United States is at odds with Russia over the eastern Ukraine conflict and Washington and Moscow have struggled to stop fighting in Syrias civil war. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said a meeting between Putin and Obama has not yet been coordinated, Russian RIA news agency reported. We are ready, RIA cited Peskov as saying. But there is no final agreement yet.  ",politicsNews,"August 29, 2016 ",1
Congressional leaders ask for more time to study new fuel rules,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Three Congressional leaders on Monday asked top federal environmental and safety officials to extend by 60 days the public comment period on new vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards. The public and their advocates need more time, beyond the comment period that ends Sept. 26, to absorb more than 1,000 pages of a draft technical assessment report, the three said in a letter to the environmental and safety chiefs. A week ago, U.S. regulators denied a similar request for an extension by major automakers. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a July report that automakers have the technology to meet aggressive mandates to hike fuel efficiency, but improvements will not be as great as the Obama administration once forecast because buyers are switching to pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles from lighter cars.         When the administration first outlined its goal of boosting average fleet fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon, regulators forecast that 67 percent of vehicles sold in 2025 would be cars.     Since then, gasoline prices have fallen and truck and SUV sales have surged.      Regulators now estimate the fleet will average 50 to 52.6mpg in 2025. The letter dated Monday was sent to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Administrator Mark Rosekind. It was signed by three members of the U.S. House of Representatives: Fred Upton, chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce; Ed Whitfield, chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Power; and Michael Burgess, chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade.

"U.S. to review use of private immigration prisons, shares slide","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security will study whether to discontinue using privately run detention centers, which the Justice Department recently called unsafe, for migrants and shares of private prison operators fell on Monday after the news. Department Secretary Jeh Johnson said he directed his advisory council to evaluate whether the agency should continue to contract with private prison operators and make a recommendation by Nov. 30. Advocates for immigrants have accused the companies of withholding proper mental health and medical care from detainees to boost profits.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a division of DHS, currently uses detention facilities run by Corrections Corp of America (CXW.N) and The GEO Group (GEO.N).  Corrections Corp of Americas stock slid 9.4 percent and The GEO Groups stock fell 6 percent immediately after news of the review. Both stocks were rebounding later in the afternoon. Corrections Corp of America earned $689 million from ICE contracts since 2008, 12 percent of its revenue from state and federal contracts over that time, according to the website SmartProcure which tracks government contracts. The company currently manages a facility for Central American women and children in Dilley, Texas. The GEO Group runs a similar facility in Karnes City, Texas and has earned $1.18 billion from contracts with ICE since 2008, about 35 percent of its total revenue from government contracts, according SmartProcure data. The GEO Group said in a statement, GEOs facilities under contract with ICE are highly rated and provide high-quality, cost-effective services in safe, secure, and humane residential environments pursuant to strict contractual requirements and the federal governments national standards, the statement said.  Corrections Corp of America spokesman Steve Owen said,    Were proud of the quality and value of the services we provide and look forward to sharing that information.        Immigration advocates and members of Congress have ramped up pressure on DHS to end its contracts with the private prison companies since the Justice Department announced on Aug. 18 it would do so.  That was prompted by an inspector generals report that criticized the safety and effectiveness of private prisons.  Rather than wait for a review and a report from a committee, the president should ensure that the phase-out of private prisons ... is extended to DHS operations immediately, said Greg Chen, advocacy director at the American Immigration Lawyers Association.  Senator Bernie Sanders, former Democratic presidential candidate, and Democratic Representative Raul Grijalva asked DHS in a letter last week to end the practice.  A Department of Homeland Security official told Reuters on Aug. 19 that ICE needed private prison companies because they offer flexibility to quickly build facilities and adjust detention space as migration flows fluctuate.  Both companies also contract with state and local prison systems, which make up about half of their revenue. A Reuters survey of 10 states with the largest contracts with private prison companies, including California and Texas, showed none had immediate plans to drop their contracts.

"Obama to meet Philippines' Duterte, broach human rights","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to meet with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Sept. 6, and plans to touch on human rights as well as security concerns, the White House said on Monday. We absolutely expect that the president will raise concerns about some of the recent statements from the president of the Philippines, White House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told a media briefing when asked whether inflammatory remarks by Duterte about women, journalists and others would be a topic of discussion. Rhodes said, however, that there were important security issues to cover as well, particularly tensions over navigation in the South China Sea. China has been incensed by a ruling against its claims in the South China Sea by an international court, a case initiated by Manila. The expected meeting between Obama and Duterte would take place in Laos, where the two leaders will be attending a summit of leaders from Pacific Rim nations. ",politicsNews,"August 29, 2016 ",1
House Committee requests EpiPen documents from Mylan,"(Reuters) - U.S. representatives Jason Chaffetz and Elijah Cummings of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform sent a letter to Mylan NV Chief Executive Heather Bresch on Monday asking for documents and communications related to the fast-increasing price of allergy auto-injector EpiPens. Mylan said earlier it would launch the first generic version of EpiPen for $300, half the price of the branded product, in the drugmakers second step in less than a week to counter a backlash over the products steep price. Chaffetz and Cummings, the committees chairman and ranking member respectively, requested documents related to Mylans revenue from sales of EpiPens since 2007, manufacturing costs and the amount the company receives from federal health care programs.

Republicans ask Clinton Foundation to produce correspondence,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Republican National Committee asked the charity of Democratic nominee Hillary Clintons family on Monday to produce all correspondence its staff had with the U.S. State Department while Clinton served as Americas most senior diplomat.  Clintons campaign to win the Nov. 8 presidential election has been dogged by criticism that donors to the Clinton Foundation may have expected special favors from the U.S. government in return. She says donors to the global charity receive no preferential treatment.     The Clinton Foundation can play a vital role in filling important gaps in the public record by demonstrating its commitment to transparency and making public all correspondence its officials had with the State Department during Secretary Clintons tenure, Reince Priebus, the RNC chairman, said in a letter to the foundations president, Donna Shalala.  The RNC provided a copy of the letter to reporters.      Spokesmen for Clinton and the foundation, which is known for its work to widen access to HIV medicines in developing countries, did not respond to a request for comment. Some emails have already emerged that show Clinton Foundation officials seeking meetings with Clinton and other diplomats on behalf of supporters who have made large donations to the foundation.  Foundation officials also sought other favors, including help with visa issues or urging the government to hire certain people, emails show. Spokesmen for Clinton have noted that in several cases the requests from foundation officials were unsuccessful. Thousands more emails from Clintons tenure are still in the process of being released as public records. Their release was delayed in part because of Clintons decision to use an unauthorized private email server for her work without informing record-keeping officials.  In his letter, Priebus said the foundations own records have the unique ability to establish whether donors received special treatment.     Clinton promised President Barack Obama that her familys charities would annually disclose all their donors and seek prior approval from the State Department for any additional money given by foreign governments when Obama made her his most senior diplomat in 2009. The charities said last year they failed to comply with the promises, blaming oversights. The foundation has said it will no longer accept foreign or corporate funding for at least some of its work if Clinton is elected. Her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, will remain on the board.

Climate change looms large in Obama's final trip to Asia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When President Barack Obama sets out this week to meet world leaders in China and Laos during his final presidential trip to Asia, he will make an unusual stop along the way. With time running out for more action on climate change during his time in office, Obama will drop in to Midway Atoll, a far-flung and largely uninhabited coral reef that is a refuge for sharks, albatrosses and endangered turtles and seals. The photo-rich stop is aimed at both raising awareness about the threat posed by climate change, and showcasing Obamas decision to protect a larger part of the ocean around Hawaii. But the trip to the middle of the Pacific Ocean will also highlight the high stakes of climate change just before Obama meets world leaders in China. I think its going to be an amazing sequence, and one that really matters, said Doug McCauley, a conservation biologist from University of California, Santa Barbara. Suddenly, youre sitting in a room with the leaders who will decide what the fate of that place is going to be, McCauley said. The rare trip is both a signal of the importance Obama gives to climate change - and a sign of his focus in bliateral meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two leaders have clashed on economic and security issues, but forged common ground on climate, which helped secure a global deal to cut carbon emissions at a Paris conference last year. We have to recognize that climate change and clean energy cooperation has really helped to create better overall stability in the U.S.-China relationship, writ large, said Andrew Light, a former senior climate official in Obamas State Department. Light, now with the World Resources Institute think tank, said he expects Xi and Obama will try to push other G20 leaders to agree to timelines for implementing the Paris agreement and work on cutting other greenhouse gases like methane and hydrofluorocarbons. Any progress on climate issues could be a rare bright spot in a trip otherwise dominated by concerns about the international economy, anti-globalization sentiments and global security problems. With less than five months left in the White House, Obama is racing to cement his record through actions he can take without help from the gridlocked U.S. Congress. For example, at Obamas final meeting with his Canadian and Mexican counterparts, the leaders set new goals for clean energy production. Republicans in Congress have thwarted Obamas legislative efforts on climate, and mocked him for his focus on an issue they see as less pressing than the economy and defense. Obama also has faced criticism from environmental groups for not doing more to limit U.S. oil and gas production. If were going address the climate crisis or meet our climate commitments, the vast, vast majority of fossil fuels need to remain in the ground, said Brendan Cummings, conservation director with the Center for Biological Diversity. But former Environmental Protection Agency director Carol Browner said Obama has done what he could on climate both through leadership on the international stage, and by using existing laws to kick-start the clean energy sector and cut emissions from vehicles and power plants. Nobody should ever be disappointed with this president on climate change, said Browner, who led the White House climate push in Obamas first term. ",politicsNews,"August 29, 2016 ",1
"U.S. Senate's Reid, in last round, jabs outside money in Nevada succession fight","LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Outside political money is pouring into a race in Nevada to replace U.S. Democratic Senator Harry Reid, who is retiring and who told Reuters that the main reason his favored successor isnt winning easily is cash from beyond the states borders. In a race that underscores the rise of outside money in U.S. campaign finance, as well as a key demographic challenge facing the Republican Party, Catherine Cortez Masto and Joe Heck are in a dead heat to replace the Senates No. 1 Democrat. Democrat Cortez Masto, 52, was a two-term Nevada attorney general. If she wins, she will be the first Latina elected to the U.S Senate. Republican Heck, 54, is a three-term House of Representatives member, physician and U.S. Army Reserve general. Polls show a tight race, with the two tied at 37 percent of likely voters in a mid-August Suffolk University survey.  The seat they are contesting is the only one in the Senate this year that Republicans have a truly good chance of flipping to their control from the Democrats. Doing so would shield Republicans Senate majority, which is under threat elsewhere. Saying in an interview that Hecks campaign is fueled by outside money, Reid, a former boxer, lashed out at the Koch brothers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Karl Rove. The Chamber of Commerce is nothing more than a front anymore for the Koch brothers. Karl Rove, he doesnt raise that money. He just goes to the Koch brothers. Theyre all fronts for the Koch brothers, said Reid, 76. Catherines going to win. And if the Koch brothers werent involved, shed win by 15 points, Reid said. Charles and David Koch are wealthy industrialists who spend millions of dollars supporting libertarian-leaning candidates, mostly Republicans, through a network of groups, some operating under a law that lets them keep their donors identities secret. Reid, who now walks with a cane and often appears in dark sunglasses, has long warred with the Kochs. Weve certainly seen our fair share of criticism from Senator Reid. But we want to talk about the issues and he moves toward the politics of personal attacks, said James Davis, spokesman for the Koch-aligned Freedom Partners Action Fund. The Supreme Court, in its 2010 Citizens United decision, opened the door to a tidal wave of political spending by corporations and labor unions on political causes and candidates, reshaping U.S. campaign finance.  More than 20 political groups, including two Koch-aligned organizations and the Reid-aligned Senate Majority PAC, have poured well over $20 million into the Nevada Senate race so far, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign spending. Overall, the spending favors Heck over Cortez Masto by nearly 2-to-1. Freedom Partners and another Koch-aligned group, Concerned Veterans for America, have spent nearly $6 million, mostly on ads portraying Cortez Masto as captive to special interests.  Rove, formerly an adviser to Republican President George W. Bush, is now a Republican activist. He co-founded Republican Super PAC American Crossroads. Spokesman Ian Prior called Reids accusations about Rove and the Kochs funny. Prior said, Look, if Harry Reid is looking for a bogeyman to star in his dark fantasy movie, he should just cast himself. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the largest lobbying group for corporations in Washington and closely aligned with the Republican Party. On Reids allegations that it is a front for the Kochs, Chamber spokesman Blair Latoff Holmes said, This is not true, butitscertainly not the first time Senator Reid has made unsubstantiated allegations. Nevadas biggest city is Las Vegas and nearly three-quarters of the states population lives in or near the casino capital. Nevada reflects the United States growing racial diversity. In 1970, Nevadans were 87 percent white and 6 percent Latino; by 2010, that ratio was 54 percent white and 26 percent Latino. Heck, who is white, has managed to get elected to Congress from an ethnically diverse congressional district split evenly between Republicans and Democrats. But Democrats have a 72,000-vote registration advantage over Republicans in Nevada and Latinos helped elect President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has angered many Latinos with his vow to build a wall on the Mexican border and to deport undocumented aliens. Heck has endorsed Trump. While Trumps popularity has crumbled in some other states, he has stayed within 2 percentage points of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in Nevada. Cortez Masto has been keen to link Heck to Trump. She said in an interview that Heck has followed Trumps example of mud-slinging, dirty campaigning. Heck spokesman Brian Baluta said Cortez Masto has distorted  Hecks record. She talks about Joe more than she talks about herself and its always in the most vile and negative way, Baluta said.

More U.S. counties to see Obamacare marketplace monopoly: analysis,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nearly a third of U.S. counties likely will be served by only one insurer that participates in an Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace in 2017, according to an analysis published on Sunday by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The 31 percent of U.S. counties that will have just a single option of insurers within the ACAs exchanges would represent an increase from 7 percent this year, the nonpartisan group found. Despite sharing a namesake, the Kaiser Family Foundation is not associated with healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente. UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) and Aetna Inc (AET.N) have decided to largely exit government-run online marketplaces in 2017 that sell subsidized plans created under President Barack Obamas national healthcare reform law, citing low enrollment and high service costs. The bulk of the decrease in counties with a choice of insurers is due to UnitedHealths pullback, which was announced in April. The data underscores the degree to which industry retrenchment is curtailing individuals options within the marketplaces. Insurer departures may lead to higher costs within that market, analysts have said. One county - Pinal County in Arizona - risks having no insurer options at all within the marketplace, the analysis found. The studys authors said another plan offered elsewhere in the state could expand to serve the county. The foundation said it could take more months and more data for the full impact of the changes for 2017 to become clear. A number of steps remain before the full picture of this years Marketplace competition is known but the ACA has greatly expanded the insurance options available to consumers in the individual marketplace, said Marjorie Connolly, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in a statement.

Bosnian Serbs make shoes for Melania Trump's White House march,"BANJA LUKA, Bosnia (Reuters) - A Bosnian Serb factory on Monday presented two pairs of shoes as a gift for the wife of U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Slovenian-born Melania, in a gesture of support for Trumps White House campaign. Many Serbs in the Balkans back Trump, ill-disposed to rival Hillary Clinton whose husband Bill backed NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions toward the end of the 1992-95 Bosnian war. He also advocated a 1999 NATO bombing of then-Yugolsavia to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians.  Marinko Umicevic, technical director at the Banja Luka shoe factory Bema, said the gift countered what she called a dirty campaign against the aspiring First Lady whose homeland, like Bosnia, was a part of Yugoslavia when she was born. Melania Trumps speech at the Republican National Convention in July ignited controversy, containing a section strikingly similar to words delivered at the Democratic convention in 2008 by President Barack Obama, Michelle. The shoes for Melania Trump are our response to the dirty comments she has been exposed to as a wife and a mother, said Umicevic. The shoes, to be sent by express post, were displayed for media on a table, set in a display of white roses. One pair was gold-colored, with cushioned soles fashioned, according to Umicevic, to help Melania follow her husbands campaign across America. The others were white stilettos for a triumphant walk into the White House. Umicevic said the shoe moulds were made by a factory in Melania Trumps hometown of Sevnice and designed by Bemas best shoe designers. We hope that America will stop being the world policeman, Umicevic told Reuters. We are hoping a friendship will come in the future from the United States instead of bombs that Serbs got from Bill Clinton, he added. ",politicsNews,"August 29, 2016 ",1
Trump to give speech on illegal immigration on Wednesday,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday night that he would make a major speech on illegal immigration in Arizona on Wednesday. The announcement came a day after Trump said he would crack down on illegal immigrants who overstay their visas, as he sought to clarify his views on how to overhaul the U.S. immigration system. Last week, Trump had said he was softening on his plan to deport all 11 million illegal immigrants. That stance had aroused criticism from conservatives who wanted him to stand fast after he won the Republican presidential nomination in large part with a hard-line position that called for building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. I will be making a major speech on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION on Wednesday in the GREAT State of Arizona. Big crowds, looking for a larger venue, Trump, who had postponed an immigration speech originally planned for last Thursday in Denver, said in his tweet on Sunday. In another tweet on Sunday night, Trump said both he and Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival for the Nov. 8 election, should release detailed medical records. I have no problem in doing so! Hillary? In his speech on Saturday in Iowa, Trump said he would seek to institute a tracking system to ensure illegal immigrants who overstay their visas are quickly removed, and would propose an e-verify system to prevent undocumented residents from gaining access to welfare and other benefits. If we dont enforce visa expiration dates, then we have an open border  its as simple as that, he said. Trump said his first priority on taking office next January would be the immediate deportation of thousands of undocumented immigrants who remain in the United States despite having committed crimes. These international gangs and cartels will be a thing of the past, he said. Their reign of terror will be over. In this task, we will always err on the side of protecting the American people  we will use immigration law to prevent crimes, and will not wait until some innocent American has been harmed or killed before taking action. Trump did not explain how his plan would affect undocumented residents who have been in the United States for decades and obeyed U.S. laws. ",politicsNews,"August 28, 2016 ",1
Trump vows crackdown on immigrants who overstay visas if elected,"DES MOINES, Iowa (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump offered fresh details of how he would tackle illegal immigration on Saturday, saying he would crack down on those who overstay their visas as he sought to quiet criticism from conservatives. In a campaign speech in Des Moines, Iowa, Trump also cited the shooting death of a cousin of NBA star Dwyane Wade to urge African-American voters to rally behind him, calling it an example of violence that has to be addressed. Trump, speaking on the Iowa State Fairgrounds with hay bales stacked behind him, sought to clarify his views on how to overhaul the U.S. immigration system after saying earlier in the week that he was softening on his plan to deport all 11 million illegal immigrants. That stance drew fire from conservatives who wanted him to stand fast after he won the Republican presidential nomination in large part by a hardline stance that would include building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. In his speech, Trump said he would seek to institute a tracking system to ensure illegal immigrants who overstay their visas are quickly removed, and would propose an e-verify system to prevent the illegal community from gaining access to welfare and other benefits. If we dont enforce visa expiration dates, then we have an open border  its as simple as that, he said. In outlining his views, Trump said addressing illegal immigration is important to helping Americans find jobs. Every time an African-American citizen, or any citizen, loses their job to an illegal immigrant, the rights of that American citizen have been violated, he said. Equal protection under the law must include the consistent application of our immigration laws. Trump said his first priority upon taking office next January would be the immediate deportation of thousands of illegal immigrants who remain in the United States despite having committed crimes. These international gangs and cartels will be a thing of the past. Their reign of terror will be over. In this task, we will always err on the side of protecting the American people  we will use immigration law to prevent crimes, and will not wait until some innocent American has been harmed or killed before taking action, he said. He did not explain how his plan would affect many of the illegal community who have been in the United States for decades and obeyed U.S. laws. Trump said the death in Chicago of Wade cousin Nykea Aldridge, 32, a mother of four, was an example of turmoil in U.S. inner cities. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a former chief of staff to Democratic President Barack Obama, has struggled in particular to contain violence in his city. The incident permitted Trump to bring up again his desire to be a law and order president and underscore his drive to appeal to African-American voters who traditionally vote Democratic and overwhelmingly support Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. It breaks all of our hearts to see it, its horrible, Trump said. And its only getting worse. This shouldnt happen in our country. This shouldnt happen in America. We send our thoughts and our prayers to the family, and we also promise to fight for a much, much better tomorrow. Trump raised the subject after sending out tweets earlier in the day that prompted charges of insensitivity to the death and accusations he sought to exploit it for political purposes. The New York businessman was the headline speaker at Joni Ernsts Roast and Ride, a charity event for military veterans run by U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican. Ernst and most other speakers offered praise for Trump, a rarity at a time when many Republican political leaders have distanced themselves from his candidacy due to his incendiary rhetoric. Trump is running neck and neck with Clinton in polls in the state with 72 days until the Nov. 8 election. ",politicsNews,"August 27, 2016 ",1
Former Obama aide calls Trump a 'psychopath',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former top adviser to President Barack Obama on Sunday labeled Donald Trump a psychopath, saying the Republican presidential nominee met the clinical definition of the personality disorder. With a little more than two months to go before the Nov. 8 U.S. election, the comments by David Plouffe, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama and manager of his 2008 presidential campaign, mark another escalation in a series of blows exchanged between Trumps camp and that of his Democrat rival Hillary Clinton. Basically, you have a psychopath running for president. I mean, he meets the clinical definition, Plouffe said in an interview on NBCs Meet the Press. When challenged, Plouffe acknowledged he had no degree in psychology but rattled off what he said were the New York businessmans symptoms: grandiose notion of self-worth; pathological lying; lack of empathy and remorse. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last week, Clinton accused Trump of fueling Americas radical fringe with racist rhetoric, while Trump said Clinton was letting down black Americans with failed policies and called her a bigot who sees people of color only as votes, not as human beings. Obama has also lambasted Trump, saying of him: Somebody who makes those kinds of statements doesnt have the judgment, the temperament, the understanding to occupy the most powerful position in the world.

The negotiations with the USA have de facto failed because we Europeans did not want to subject ourselves to American demands, he said, according to a written transcript from German broadcaster ZDF of an interview due to be broadcast on Sunday.

Democrat Clinton receives first security briefing,"(Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton on Saturday received her first national security briefing since accepting her partys nomination for the presidency last month. Clinton, a former secretary of state, attended the meeting alone, according to a pool report. The meeting was held at the Federal Bureau of Investigations field office in White Plains, New York, not far from the Chappaqua, New York, residence she shares with her husband, former President Bill Clinton. It lasted a little over two hours. Clintons Republican rival, New York businessman Donald Trump, recently received his first briefing, as well. The two are vying for the White House in the Nov. 8 general election, which has grown increasingly contentious as they have traded barbs about racism and minority voters.

Clinton attacks Trump's outreach to black voters in new ad,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton called on Friday for voters to reject the bigotry of Donald Trumps White House campaign, releasing a television ad criticizing his efforts to appeal to black voters and saying she was reaching out to people from all parties who are troubled by his candidacy. The ad shows video of Trumps controversial pitch to black voters, in which the Republican candidate urges them to support him by asking, What do you have to lose? It also shows headlines about a racial discrimination lawsuit the New York real estate mogul faced in the 1970s. Clintons presidential campaign said the ad, released a day after she gave a speech accusing Trump of fueling Americas radical fringe, would air in the hotly contested states of Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Polls give Clinton a wide margin over Trump among Hispanic voters, but he is on a pitch to reduce her advantage by stressing he would create jobs for all. Trump pressed on with trying to broaden his appeal to minority voters on Friday, as he met with Hispanic business leaders at his signature hotel in Las Vegas. Weve been doing very, very well with the Latinos. Weve been doing amazing, far, far greater ... than anyone understands. They want to see jobs come in, were going to bring jobs. They want to see things happen, Trump said. He said the countrys GDP growth rate of 1.1 percent in the second quarter was not a good sign for the U.S. economy. The country has some very, very serious problems, he said. Clinton, meanwhile, followed up on Thursdays tough speech by saying that Trumps temperament and divisiveness made him unfit for the White House. I am reaching out to everyone, Republicans, Democrats, independents, everyone who is as troubled as I am by the bigotry and divisiveness of Donald Trumps campaign, she told MSNBC, adding she was asking fair-minded Americans to repudiate this kind of divisive demagoguery at the Nov. 8 election. Clinton attacks came during a difficult week for her campaign, as the release of new emails from her time as secretary of state revived criticism of her decision to use a private address and server rather than a government one. The emails also stoked scrutiny of her familys charitable foundation, including accusations that major corporate and foreign donors gave money in hopes of securing more access to then-Secretary Clinton. Her campaign says no donors received any special favors. Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer told MSNBC Clinton was only talking about Trump and race this week to deflect attention from that controversy.     Trump countered her rhetoric on Friday by releasing a video showing Clinton in the 1990s discussing a crime bill and referring to super-predators, or at-risk youth she said needed to be brought under control. The video also shows U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, Clintons main opponent in the Democratic primary this year, calling that phrase a racist term. In targeting what she terms Trumps bigotry, Clinton hopes to remind voters of controversial statements he has made over the course of the campaign. Those include describing some Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists, suggesting a judge could not be fair because of his Mexican-American heritage, and proposing a temporary ban on Muslim immigration to combat terrorism. Trump has tried to sidestep these dust-ups by saying Democrats have failed minorities with their economic policies, leaving them living in poverty and attending failing schools. Jennifer Hochschild, a professor at Harvard University who focuses on race and immigration, said she did not think Trump could fix his relationship with black and Hispanic voters. General cluelessness about racial dynamics will diminish any possible black support that comes from Trumps emphasis on job creation, Hochschild said in an email. And Clinton has a lot of deep roots among black politicians. Trump also has been criticized for vowing to deport millions of people living in the United States illegally. In recent days, he had appeared to hold out the possibility of toning down his hardline stance, although his precise plans on immigration have been harder to pin down. On Thursday, he denied he would loosen his proposed immigration restrictions. ",politicsNews,"August 26, 2016 ",1
Clinton leads Trump by 5 points in Reuters/Ipsos poll," NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton leads her Republican rival Donald Trump by 5 percentage points among likely voters, down from a peak this month of 12 points, according to the Reuters/Ipsos daily tracking poll released on Friday.  DONT MISS: Not enough money for a 'real' coffins in Venezuela Carl Icahn says he didn't sell Herbalife shares Burkini controversy goes on in France The Aug. 22-25 opinion poll found that 41 percent of likely voters supported Clinton ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election, while 36 percent supported Trump. Some 23 percent would not pick either candidate and answered refused, other or wouldnt vote.  Clinton, a former secretary of state, has led real estate developer Trump in the poll since Democrats and Republicans ended their national conventions and formally nominated their presidential candidates in July. Her level of support has varied between 41 and 45 percent during that period, and her lead over Trump in the tracking poll peaked this month at 12 percentage points on Tuesday.  During the past week, Clinton has been dogged by accusations by Trump, which she has denied, that donations to her familys charitable foundation influenced her actions while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Questions have also surfaced again about her use of a private email server and address rather than a government one during her period at the State Department.  Meanwhile, Trump and Clinton also sparred over who would be a better advocate for African Americans and other minorities, and Trump hinted he could soften his hard-line stance on immigration.  In a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll that includes candidates from small, alternative parties, Clinton leads the field by a smaller margin. Some 39 percent of likely voters supported Clinton in the four-way poll, compared with 36 percent for Trump, 7 percent for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and 3 percent for Green Party nominee Jill Stein.  Both polls were conducted online in English in all 50 states. They included 1,154 likely voters and have a credibility interval of 3 percentage points.  The results may differ from the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project, which includes a separate weekly tracking poll that measures support for the major party candidates in every state and Washington D.C.  The States of the Nation, released on Wednesday, estimated that if the election were held now Clinton would have a 95 percent chance of winning by a margin of about 108 votes in the Electoral College, the body that decides the election through a count of the candidates wins in each state.

Illinois governor urges 2018 vote on 'rigged' political mapmaking,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois Republican Governor Bruce Rauner urged lawmakers on Friday to allow voters in 2018 to decide whether to change how political boundaries are drawn after the states Supreme Court a day earlier declared a petition-driven redistricting initiative for this falls statewide ballot unconstitutional. Rauner called Illinois existing political maps, which are drawn by Democrats who control the General Assembly, rigged and gerrymandered because they have left a majority of legislative races this fall without challengers to incumbent legislators. Our system of government is broken, Rauner told reporters during a stop in Marion, in far southern Illinois. Two-thirds of our general elections dont have opponents, and weve got to change the system. The next opportunity for state legislators to put a constitutional amendment before voters comes in two years, when the first-term governor is expected to be in the midst of a re-election campaign. Our system has been run by a broken, powerful political machine in Chicago that looks out for itself, not for the people of Illinois, and certainly not for the people of southern Illinois, Rauner said. Weve got to get the power away from that machine, and we can do it with political reform. Rauners comments came less than 24 hours after the Illinois Supreme Court ruled 4-3 to uphold a lower court ruling that would keep in place the once-a-decade, partisan-controlled political mapmaking process that has allowed for Democratic majorities in the state legislature and on the elected Supreme Court. The amendment, if it was placed on Novembers ballot and passed by a majority of Illinois voters, would have transferred the power of re-drawing legislative districts to a bipartisan commission. More than 563,000 Illinois voters signed petitions backing the amendment.  There were 12 redistricting amendments filed in both chambers during the current legislative session though none won approval in both chambers. The Illinois Supreme Court ruled the ballot initiative fell outside the scope of permissible ballot initiatives, which may only be used for amendments directed at structural and procedural subjects in the constitution pertaining to Illinoiss legislative branch. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Robert Thomas wrote: Today a muzzle has been placed on the people of this State, and their voices supplanted by judicial fiat. ",politicsNews,"August 26, 2016 ",1
Maine governor apologizes for obscenity-laced voicemail,"(Reuters) - Maine Governor Paul LePage apologized on Friday for an obscenity-laced voicemail he left for a lawmaker who he believed had called him a racist for remarks he made about drug dealers.  The incident followed a town hall meeting on Wednesday during which LePage said he kept a binder with photographs of drug dealers arrested in Maine and more than 90 percent of them were black or Hispanic, the Portland Press Herald reported.  The governors remarks triggered a barrage of criticism from political figures and the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine.  LePage left the voicemail message for State Representative Drew Gattine after a television reporter said the lawmaker was among several people who had called the governor a racist. According to a recording of the message obtained by the Portland Press Herald, LePage said in the message, Mr. Gattine, this is Gov. Paul Richard LePage. I would like to talk to you about your comments about my being a racist, you cocksucker. I want to talk to you. I want you to prove that Im a racist.   Ive spent my life helping black people and you little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker. You  I need you to, just friggin. I want you to record this and make it public because I am after you. Thank you.  The governor later told local reporters that he wished he could settle the dispute with Gattine by means of an armed duel. Gattine did not respond immediately to calls for comment.     He told the Press Herald that LePages voicemail was uncalled for and that he never said the governor was a racist. An editorial in the Press Herald, speaking for the states voters, said Maine apologized to America for electing, then re-electing a governor who is unfit for high office. After the voicemail became public, LePage issued a statement apologizing to Maine citizens for calling Gattine the worst word [he] could think of in the voicemail. The governor defended his choice of language by saying the remarks were simply a metaphor that harkens back to the 1820s when political opponents used to call each other out. I meant no physical harm to Gattine, LePage said in the statement.  It is not the first time LePage has found himself the subject of controversy. Earlier this year, he said that drug dealers come up here, they sell their heroin and they go home. Incidentally, half the time, they impregnate a young white girl before they leave. He later said the comment was a slip-up and that he meant to say that drug traffickers get young Maine girls pregnant and that most residents of Maine are white. Also in January, LePage told Maine gun owners they should load up and get rid of the drug dealers.  ",politicsNews,"August 26, 2016 ",1
"As racial politics loom over election, Obama's legacy is seen as mixed","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Barack Obama became the first African-American to win the White House in 2008, his victory was a turning point in U.S. race relations that set high expectations for progress to come. Nearly eight years later, with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton attacking each other over racial politics, the legacy of Obamas presidency looks decidedly mixed, black leaders said. To some, the tone of the Republican presidential nominees campaign, as well as a recent series of racially charged shootings involving police, show that the United States has come no closer to overcoming its history of racial strife. Having a black president, two attorneys general and a chief of homeland security did not result in basic fairness for victims of racially charged violence, said Cornel West, an academic and former Obama supporter who has become a high-profile critic of the Democratic president.  How many policemen who have murdered unarmed innocent black civilians have gone to jail with that kind of black power at the top? Zero, West said. Obama could have acted more directly while in office to help blacks, West added, citing persistently high childhood poverty among African-Americans. The (economic) recovery has not filtered over into black and working poor communities, he said. Others said Obama showed leadership on race while making real achievements on healthcare and the economy that helped Americans of all ethnicities. Al Sharpton, a civil rights leader with close ties to the White House, described Obama as a transformative president held back by the need to serve varying constituencies and compromise with lawmakers who had different priorities. He tried to be as balanced and respectful as he could, to the chagrin of many in the black community, who felt that he was leaning over backwards, Sharpton said. Unemployment among African-Americans fell by half under Obama, Sharpton noted, while Obamas remarks on race elevated the issue. In 2012 at the White House, Obama referred to Trayvon Martin, a black youth gunned down by a white Hispanic man, as a boy who would have resembled the son he did not have. Weve never had a president do that, Sharpton said. Andrew Young, a former Atlanta mayor, congressman, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and adviser to slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., said Obama, as a black leader, had to seek compromise more than previous white presidents. It was easier for (Jimmy) Carter or Lyndon Johnson, even Bill Clinton as southern whites to do things specifically for black people, Young said. Backlash from white working class voters had contributed to Trumps rise, Young said. We really havent had a complete psychological adjustment to a multi-racial society, he said. Thats whats rallying people behind Trump. Theyre frustrated by the complexities of this day and age. And (Trump), like others, gives a simple answer and blames it on somebody else. Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, blasted Trump on Thursday as a divisive candidate who was stoking racist groups. Trump criticized Clinton, saying she had let black Americans down and was falsely labeling Republicans as bigoted. Clinton supporters were more likely to want to address race relations than Trump supporters, a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll of more than 2,800 people found in late March. Obama has said race relations are not as bad as some suggest. Friends say he never expected his presidency to wipe away centuries of racism and slaverys legacy. To expect to erase all of that legacy of injustice or racism and discrimination in eight years is unrealistic, said Valerie Jarrett, a White House adviser and close Obama friend. Were there people who probably had a false sense of progress based just on an election? Sure, she said. The administration wants to advance criminal justice reform legislation before Obama leaves office, aiming for a win on an issue watched closely in the black community. But prospects of passage in Congress during an election year are uncertain.  Obama, who has made clear his disdain for Trump and his frustration with Congress, has said he hoped his own voice on race would help improve things for future generations. We plant seeds, and somebody else maybe sits under the shade of the tree that we planted, Obama said at a news conference in July. ",politicsNews,"August 26, 2016 ",1
Obama's judges leave liberal imprint on U.S. law," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When President Barack Obama entered the White House in 2009, the federal appeals court based in Virginia was known as one of the most conservative benches in the country.  Two Obama terms later, Democratic appointees hold a 10-5 majority on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a panel of which issued a groundbreaking ruling this April backing transgender rights.  FACTBOX:Cases where Obama judges left a mark The shift to the left on the court, which hears cases from Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, South Carolina and North Carolina, highlights a widely overlooked aspect of Obamas legacy.  His appointments of dozens of judges to the countrys influential federal appeals courts have tilted the judiciary in a liberal direction that will influence rulings for years to come and be further entrenched if Democrat Hillary Clinton wins this Novembers presidential election.  MORE FROM REUTERS Election 2016 LIVE: Who is the better president for minority voters? Bolivia says deputy interior minister killed after kidnap by miners Judge orders search of Clinton emails from 2012 Benghazi attack by September 13 A Reuters review of rulings by the courts over the last two years shows Obamas appointees to the appeals courts have influenced major legal battles likely to ultimately reach the Supreme Court.  Obama-appointed judges have voted in favor of broad civil rights protections, major Obama administration regulations and gun regulations and against Republican-backed voting rules.  When seeking to appoint judges, the White House has said it is looking for highly credentialed lawyers reflecting the diversity of U.S. society. Conservative critics say he has picked judges who are willing to circumvent the law in order to reach preferred outcomes.  Theres no question President Obamas nominees have absolutely been part of his effort to transform the country and move it dramatically to the left, said Carrie Severino, a conservative legal activist.  White House spokesman Eric Schultz said in a statement that Obamas appointees all share impeccable qualifications, unquestioned integrity, and a steadfast commitment to equal justice under the law.  The appeals courts are the first stop for any case appealed from the lower U.S. district courts and often have the last word. The next and final destination is the Supreme Court, but it hears fewer than 100 cases a year. The appeals courts handle 35,000 a year according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.  Of the 13 appeals courts, nine now have a majority of Democratic appointees, compared with one when Obama took office, according to research carried out by Russell Wheeler, a scholar at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.  In addition to appointing two Supreme Court justices and dozens of district court judges, Obama appointments now make up 55 of the current 168 appeals court judges, according to the judiciary. Obamas current total of 323 district and appeals court appointments, most of them district court judges, is similar to the tallies achieved by other recent two-term presidents.  The regional appeals courts are currently more powerful than ever because of the vacancy on the Supreme Court caused by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, which has left the court divided equally between liberals and conservatives. If the ideologically divided court splits 4-4, the appeals court ruling is left intact. Such an outcome occurred four times in the Supreme Court term that recently ended.  Scalias seat is unlikely to be filled until next year due to political opposition from Republicans in the Senate, which has the job of confirming nominees.  One of the most dramatic transformations has been on the 4th Circuit.  In July 2007, 18 months before Obama became president, Republican appointees held a 7-5 majority. Through a mix of seven Obama appointments and retirements, Democratic appointees now hold sway.  In April, a three-judge panel featuring two Obama appointees ruled in favor of a transgender student seeking to use a boys restroom. The two Obama appointees were in the majority, with a Republican appointee dissenting.  Three months later, a three-judge panel featuring two Obama appointees and one judge appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton struck down North Carolinas strict voter identification law on a 3-0 vote, saying the state legislature had enacted it with discriminatory intent.  It is one of several recent court rulings pushing back on Republican-led efforts to impose new voting regulations, which Democrats say is intended to deter minorities from voting.  Caroline Fredrickson, president of liberal legal group the American Constitution Society, said Republican-appointed judges are generally less likely to rule in favor of broad interpretations of civil rights. The transgender case would very likely have come out differently with a more conservative panel of judges, she said.  The federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. is another where the balance of power has been flipped. Often known in legal circles as the second highest court in the land because it hears important cases concerning the federal government, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was dominated by conservatives 6-3 when Obama took office.  Obama was able to force through four appointments after a major showdown in the Senate. The court now has a 7-4 split in favor of Democratic appointees.  In June, an Obama appointee, Judge Sri Srinivasan, cast the deciding vote as a three-judge panel upheld the Federal Communication Commissions so-called net neutrality regulation. Srinivasan joined a Clinton appointee in the majority. A judge appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan dissented. The regulation is widely opposed by the telecommunications industry and backed by digital rights advocates.  Obamas appointees do sometimes vote in favor of conservative outcomes. Paul Watford, a judge on the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, has on several occasions reached a different conclusion to his more liberal colleagues. In one recent decision from Aug. 15, he dissented along with conservative judges when the court ruled that a death row inmate should be able to file a new appeal.  When announcing three of his nominees to the appeals court in Washington at a White House press conference in June 2013, Obama rejected any notion that they were political pawns, emphasizing their strong credentials.  These are no slouches. These are no hacks, he said.  ",politicsNews,"August 26, 2016 ",1
White House proposes rule to welcome immigrant entrepreneurs,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration proposed a rule on Friday aimed at attracting thousands of immigrant entrepreneurs to start companies in the United States.  The rule, proposed by the Department of Homeland Security, would ease the ability of startup founders to build companies if they have significant funding from U.S. investors. The administration hopes the rule will be completed before President Barack Obamas term ends on Jan. 20. The proposed rule is part of Obamas commitment to attracting the worlds best and brightest entrepreneurs to start the next great companies here, Tom Kalil, a technology policy adviser at the White House, told reporters in a call. Kalil said immigrants have co-founded as many as one in four high-tech startups across the United States and more than half of all startups in Silicon Valley.  Immigration has been a crucial issue in the 2016 presidential campaign ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Republican candidate Donald Trump has vowed to toughen immigration policies, while Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has proposed creating an office of immigrant affairs to expand Obamas efforts to help immigrants integrate better into the country.  Under the rule, DHS would issue temporary permission for entrepreneurs to live in the United States if they have at least 15 percent ownership in startup companies formed in the country within the past three years. The companies must have investment of at least $345,000 from qualified U.S. investors. The administration expects about 3,000 immigrants would apply for the temporary permission, known as parole. Max Levchin, a co-founder of PayPal and other companies who was born in Ukraine, said the proposed rule is a great, concrete step toward creating more jobs in America and more success stories. Many entrepreneurs are educated at prestigious U.S. universities, but find themselves unable to stay in the country  because they lose visa lotteries or cant afford to sponsor themselves through an existing investor visa program. We lose and will continue to lose talented, skilled, well educated scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs because they are simply not allowed to stay and work after we educated them to very high standards, Levchin said. It makes very little sense. ",politicsNews,"August 26, 2016 ",1
Former Bush adviser Wolfowitz to vote for Clinton: Spiegel,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Paul Wolfowitz, a Republican adviser to former U.S. President George W. Bush, plans to vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the November presidential election despite his serious reservations, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday. Wolfowitz, who served as deputy defense secretary under Bush and also as president of the World Bank, said he viewed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as a security risk because of his admiration of Russian President Putin and his views on China, the magazine reported. Its important to make it clear how unacceptable he is, the magazine quoted Wolfowitz as saying in an interview. Wolfowitz joins a long list of Republicans who have said they will not vote for Trump. I wish there was a candidate whom I could support enthusiastically. I will have to vote for Hillary Clinton, although I have serious reservations about her, he said. A Reuters/Ipsos poll this week showed that Clinton would win the key swing states of Florida, Ohio and Virginia, and have a 95 percent chance of beating Trump if the election were held now. Wolfowitz rejected a common description of him as a key architect of the 2003 U.S. war against Iraq, saying that if he had truly been the architect many things would have gone differently, the magazine reported. Wolfowitz said the goal had been to free the country, not occupy it, creating tensions with many Iraqis. He also defended the decision to invade Iraq, saying it was based on intelligence that later turned out to be faulty. Of course we would have proceeded differently if we had known that Saddam Hussein was not stockpiling weapons of mass destruction, but was only planning to do so, he said. We would not have invaded. In an interview with Vanity Fair magazine in May 2003, several months after the invasion, he suggested there were multiple reasons for it, but the Bush administration highlighted Iraqs supposed WMD as the justification for the war as the most politically convenient. For bureaucratic reasons, we settled on one issue, weapons of mass destruction, because it was the one reason everyone could agree on, he said at the time.

Obama expands Hawaii marine reserve in final push on climate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama will dramatically expand the Papahnaumokukea Marine National Monument off the coast of Hawaii on Friday, the White House said, an action that will ban commercial fishing from more than 582,500 sq miles (1.5 million sq km) of the Pacific Ocean. Obama will visit the protected area on Sept. 1 to draw attention to the threat that climate change poses to oceans, traveling to Midway Atoll - a remote coral reef that was the site of a pivotal World War Two battle and is now known for its sea turtles, monk seals, and millions of seabirds. Obama, who was born in Hawaii and spent most of his childhood there, made curbing climate change a central part of his time in the White House, which draws to a close on Jan. 20. Some of his efforts have been blocked by Congress or held up in court challenges. But preserving public space from development has been something Obama can do using his own power, and he had moved to permanently protect more than 265 million acres of land and water even before the expansion in Hawaii. Obama has also sought to use the star power of his office to raise public concern about climate issues. Trailed by camera crews, he has hiked on an Alaska glacier and walked through the Florida Everglades. His journey to Midway Atoll, a former naval base that is now a rarely visited refuge, is aimed at sending a hopeful message. The best science shows that the ocean can recover, if you allow it to, said Senator Brian Schatz, who worked with scientists, environmental groups and native Hawaiians to urge Obama to expand the monument. As daunting as the problem of climate change is, and as troubling as the situation is with respect to our oceans, they show remarkable resilience, if you give them a chance, Schatz told Reuters. The monument was first established 10 years ago by former Republican President George W. Bush, who created the worlds largest marine reserve at the time, protecting close to 140,000 sq miles of ocean around the Hawaiian archipelago and inspiring a series of similar projects around the world. The four-fold boost in territory will cover an area with more than 7,000 marine species, including a coral that is the worlds oldest-known living organism at 4,265 years old. We think of Papahnaumokukeas original designation as a catalyst, and were hoping it will be again, said Seth Horstmeyer, a director with Pews Global Ocean Legacy project. Only about 3 percent of the worlds oceans have similar protections, according to Pew. Obama is set on Wednesday to address leaders of Pacific islands and a global conference of conservation officials and environmental groups in Honolulu. We would like the other nations to follow suit, said Sol Kahoohalahala, a seventh-generation native Hawaiian. In an interview, Kahoohalahala explained that Papahnaumokukea, considered a sacred place, figures large in the creation myths of his people. We are part of this place, were not the beginning of this place, he said. Our responsibility is really as a people now how to care for this place. Some Hawaiians had argued against the expansion. Longline commercial fishermen, who have been praised for sustainable fishing, have counted on the area for an estimated 3 to 13 percent of their annual catch of tuna, which is limited under quotas and governed by extensive conservation measures. Excluding American citizens from American waters and forcing in this case fishermen onto the high seas to do their business - something just doesnt quite sit right, said Sean Martin, president of the Hawaii Longline Association, explaining the expansion could raise his costs. But Hawaiian Senator Schatz, who worked on a compromise plan to accommodate certain types of fishing and more Native Hawaiian involvement in managing the preserve, said there would be plenty of fish left for longline fishermen in other areas. They will have very little difficulty fishing up to the limit under the tuna treaty, even with the new boundaries, Schatz said. ",politicsNews,"August 26, 2016 ",1
Hillary Clinton says her family's foundation is looking for partners,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said on Friday the Clinton Foundation was seeking other organizations to  partner with as it looks to wind down some of its charitable work, but defended her work as secretary of state as independent from her familys foundation. Clinton has come under fire in recent days amid questions over the charity and its donors given her role heading the State Department from 2009 to early 2013. Critics have accused her of running a pay-for-play operation, a charge she and the foundation have denied. Even some supporters have said Clinton faces a perception problem over the issue.  I know the foundation is looking for partners, but thats going to take some time to carry out, Clinton said in an interview on MSNBC. Winding down some of these programs takes time. You dont just turn on and off ... a switch. Even trying to negotiate with partner groups takes a lot of serious effort.  My work as secretary of state was not influenced by any outside forces. I made policy decisions based on what I thought was right to keep Americans safe and to protect our interests abroad. I believe my aides also acted appropriately, she said.  Several media editorial boards this week noted the foundations philanthropic efforts in areas such as global health and HIV/AIDS, but urged the foundation - formally called the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation - to transfer the work to other large U.S. charities. Former President Bill Clinton, who helped establish the global charity after serving two terms in the White House, would resign from the board if his wife wins the Nov. 8  election, the foundation announced last week. It also said it would stop accepting some foreign and corporate donations. Hillary Clintons Republican rival for the White House, Donald Trump, and other Republicans have called for a special prosecutor to probe the charity for possible corruption, an accusation her campaign has called a groundless political smear.

Judge orders search of new Clinton emails for release by September 13,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge ordered the State Department on Thursday to release by Sept. 13 any emails it finds between Hillary Clinton and the White House from the week of the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, among the thousands of additional emails uncovered by federal investigators. The order came after the Federal Bureau of Investigation gave the department a disc earlier this month containing 14,900 emails to and from Clinton and other documents it said it had recovered that she did not return to the government. Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, has been criticized for using an unauthorized private email system run from a server in the basement of her home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, a decision she says was wrong and that she regrets. The issue has hung over her campaign for the White House and raised questions among voters about her trustworthiness.  Judge William Dimitrouleas of the U.S. District Court in southern Florida made his order in response to a request by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, which is suing the State Department for Clinton-era records under freedom of information laws. Spokesmen for Clinton did not respond to requests for comment. At least one other judge has said the department will eventually have to release all the newly recovered work emails, and at least some are expected to appear before the Nov. 8 presidential election. After the systems existence became more widely known, Clinton returned what she said were all her work emails to the State Department in 2014, and the department released them in batches to the public, some 30,000 in all. The FBI took her server in 2015 after it was discovered she had sent and received classified government secrets through the system, which the government bans.  Clinton has said she did not know the information was classified at the time. After a year-long investigation, FBI Director James Comey said last month that Clinton should have recognized the sensitivity of the information and that she had been extremely careless with government secrets. But he said there were not enough grounds for a prosecution, a decision criticized by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and other Republicans. It remained unclear if there were any newly discovered emails that related to the September 2012 attack on a U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya, in which four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, were killed. Using broad search terms, we have identified a number of documents potentially responsive to a Benghazi-related request, Elizabeth Trudeau, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement. At this time, we have not confirmed that the documents are, in fact, responsive. We also have not determined if they involve Secretary Clinton. ",politicsNews,"August 25, 2016 ",1

"Clinton, Trump clash over who is best for U.S. minorities","RENO, Nev./MANCHESTER, N.H. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump on Thursday of fuelling Americas radical fringe with racist rhetoric, even as her Republican rival sought to soften his image with an appeal to minorities. Clinton needs to retain support from black and Latino voters to win the Nov. 8 election, the same coalition that helped propel Democrat Barack Obama to the White House in 2008. Trump, whose support comes mainly from whites, is unlikely to be victorious unless he can cut into that support. Donald Trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia, Clinton said in a scathing speech in Nevada. Hes taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over one of Americas two major political parties. This is a moment of reckoning for every Republican dismayed that the Party of Lincoln has become the Party of Trump, Clinton said, referring to Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, who issued the Emancipation Proclamation and championed the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution during the Civil War that led to the abolition of slavery in 1865.  Trump, who trails Clinton in national opinion polls, has polled poorly with minorities and has been criticized for his proposals on immigration, which include deporting millions of undocumented foreigners, building a wall along the Mexican border, and suspending Muslim immigration to shore up national security. He described some Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists in a 2015 speech launching his candidacy and more recently questioned the impartiality of an American-born judge of Mexican heritage. On Thursday, the New York real estate mogul-turned-politician criticized Clinton before her speech, saying she and her party had let black Americans down with failed economic policies and were falsely labeling Republicans as bigoted.  When Democratic policies fail, they are left with only this one tired argument: Youre racist, youre racist, youre racist, Trump told a crowd in Manchester, New Hampshire. Its a tired, disgusted argument and is so totally predictable. At a Mississippi rally on Wednesday, Trump called Clinton a bigot who sees people of color only as votes, not as human beings. He argued on Thursday that Clintons opposition to charter schools and vouchers locked minority students in failing jobs, that her tax policies would hurt black-owned businesses and that she would allow immigrants to take jobs from minorities. Trump said the Clinton attacks were not only an assault on him, but on all his supporters - people, he said, who want strong borders and security. To Hillary Clinton, and to her donors and advisers, pushing her to spread smears and her lies about decent people, I have three words ... shame on you. A Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation poll for the week beginning Aug. 15 found Clinton beating Trump among Hispanic voters by 15 percentage points, and by 57 percentage points among black voters.     Trump has tried recently to broaden his appeal to them, hinting at a softening of his hardline position on immigration. In comments broadcast on Fox News on Wednesday night, Trump said he would be willing to work with immigrants who have abided by U.S. laws while living in the country, backing away from his insistence during the primaries that he would try to deport all 11 million illegal immigrants.  Trump also met with black and Latino Republican leaders at his headquarters in New York City on Thursday morning.   Trumps efforts were unlikely to draw out minorities in his favor but could reassure some moderate Republicans worried about his views on race, said Bernard Fraga, a political science professor at Indiana University. I dont think these efforts will do a lot to help him in minority communities, Fraga said.  An association of 40 Latino organizations sent a letter on Thursday calling on him to cease his rhetoric and meet with their leadership to discuss ways he could improve his outreach to Hispanics.  As we have expressed numerous times, your rhetoric of relentless attacks against our community is an issue of serious concern and has had a significant impact, fuelling an alarming trend in our nation, the letter reads.  Clinton released a video on Thursday ahead of her Nevada speech tying Trump to white supremacist groups. The video shows a Ku Klux Klan member praising Trump and plays a recording of former leader Klan leader David Duke calling on white people to vote for Trump.  The video also shows newly appointed Trump campaign chairman Steve Bannon, who ran the website Breitbart.com, which has been accused of stoking online racists.   Bannon told the magazine Mother Jones during the Republican National Convention last month that the website was the platform for the alt-right, a brand of U.S. political conservatism associated with white nationalism. Trumps campaign called for the Clinton campaign to withdraw the video.  This type of rhetoric and repulsive advertising is revolting and completely beyond the pale, Mark Burns, an African-American pastor who supports Trump, said in a statement. I call on Hillary Clinton to disavow this video and her campaign for this sickening act that has no place in our world.      ",politicsNews,"August 25, 2016 ",1
Mylan offers discounts on EpiPen amid wave of criticism,"(Reuters) - Mylan NV said on Thursday it would reduce the out-of-pocket costs of its emergency EpiPen allergy injection for some patients amid a wave of criticism from lawmakers and the public over the products rapidly escalating price. The list price of the drug will remain the same, but the company said it would increase the maximum copay assistance program to $300 from $100 for patients who pay for the 2-pak in cash or who are covered by a commercial health insurer. The price of EpiPen has skyrocketed to $600 from $100 since it was acquired by Mylan in 2007.  Mylan also said it is doubling the eligibility for its patient assistance program, which will eliminate out-of-pocket costs for uninsured and under-insured patients and families. Government paid programs are not eligible for the copay assistance program. Ronny Gal, an analyst with Bernstein, said when all is said and done he estimates a total price reduction for EpiPen of 32 percent. The price rose 27 percent in the second quarter of 2016 versus the same quarter a year ago. Thus we are basically rolling back the increase of the past year, he said. In all, we estimate that todays news results in a 20-25 percent hit on EpiPen revenues. He expects that to translate into a 3-4 percent hit to Mylans earnings per share over the next few years. He estimates the company will earn $4.77 a share in 2016 and $5.58 in 2017. Mylan is the latest company to be caught up in the growing outrage at apparently egregious drug price increases. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc and Turing Pharmaceuticals have both been publicly excoriated for similar price increases. Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who has spoken out against escalating drug prices, welcomes the fact that Mylan is now apparently open to taking steps to lower some of the cost sharing burdens imposed on families, Tyrone Gayle, a campaign spokesman, said in a statement. However, he added, discounts for selected customers without lowering the overall price of EpiPens are insufficient, because the excessive price will likely be passed on through higher insurance premiums. Clintons view was echoed by Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. Elijah Cummings, who said Mylans move is nothing but a public relations stunt that does nothing to help the majority of patients who need the drug. Offering a meager discount only after widespread bipartisan criticism is exactly the same tactic used by drug companies across the industry to distract from their exorbitant price increases, he said in a statement. Nobody is buying this PR move any more. Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, defending the price in an interview on Thursday on CNBC, said her company had spent hundreds of millions of dollars improving EpiPen, including making its needle invisible, since acquiring the device from German generic drugmaker Merck KGaA.  When we picked up this product, they (Merck) werent spending a dollar on it, said Bresch,  Bresch said Mylan recoups less than half of EpiPens list price because pharmacy benefit managers, which often require discounted prices or rebates from drugmakers, are involved, along with insurers and others. Democratic U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar said Mylans action was a welcome relief to many who are struggling to afford the medication, but said it does not address the root of the problem of rising drug costs. Earlier this year, Clinton chastised drug companies for exorbitant pricing and unveiled a plan that she said would cut costs, making the issue not only a hot election discussion topic but potentially an issue that could have policy implications if she is elected. On Wednesday, Clinton pressed Mylan to voluntarily cut the EpiPen price, sending the companys share price lower and pushing down biotech stocks. Mylan shares fell more than 10 percent this week before rising 3.2 percent on Thursday after announcement of the discount program. EpiPens are preloaded injections of epinephrine (adrenaline) used in case of a dangerous allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis that could cause death if untreated. Anaphylaxis can occur in as little as a couple of minutes of exposure to the allergen, which can come in the form of food such as peanuts or insects such as bees. Certain medications or latex can also cause a severe reaction. Symptoms include itching, swelling of the lips, tongue and roof of the mouth, tight chestedness and difficulty breathing. People who are susceptible to such reactions are frequently advised to carry an EpiPen, which can deliver an immediate emergency jolt of adrenaline to reverse the symptoms.      A group of lawmakers said on Wednesday they had written the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asking about its approval process for alternatives to the EpiPen. FDA spokeswoman Theresa Eisenman said in a statement the agency is reviewing the questions posed in the letter and will respond directly to the Congressional members. She noted that the FDA does not have the authority to review or approve drug prices. Bresch, daughter of Democratic U.S. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, said she contacted members of Congress over the past two days and asked to meet with them to discuss what she called an unsustainable drug pricing system. She said one of the calls was to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who recently wrote a letter to Mylan asking for an explanation of big EpiPen price increases.

Obama's TPP deal won't get Senate vote this year: McConnell,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday that the Senate will not vote on President Barack Obamas signature Asian trade deal this year, punting it to the next president for changes and consideration. The statement appeared to dash White House hopes for a vote to approve the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement after the Nov. 8 election and before Obama leaves office in January. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who controls the Senates voting agenda, has previously said that chances for a TPP lame duck session vote were slim or bleak. The current agreement, the Trans-Pacific (Partnership) agreement, which has some serious flaws, will not be acted upon this year, McConnell told a Kentucky State Farm Bureau breakfast in Louisville. But it will still be around. It can be massaged, changed, worked on during the next administration. So, I hope America will stay in the trade business, McConnell said. The Obama administration is in the midst of a major push to promote the TPP deal, with cabinet officials holding dozens of events this month across the United States to try to build political support. Obama is expected to tout the TPP in the next two weeks at summits of the Group of 20 major economies in China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Laos. A spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representatives office could not immediately be reached for comment on McConnells statement. A number of senators in recent weeks have declared their opposition to the TPP deal in its current form, including Democrat Tim Kaine of Virginia, who is now the partys vice presidential candidate alongside Hillary Clinton. Republican Senator Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania, who is in a tough re-election race in a state hit by manufacturing job losses, has also said he cannot support the deal. Support for the TPP deal has been stronger in farming states, where proponents argue that it would boost exports of agricultural products. Clinton has said she would seek to renegotiate the trade deal if elected and has criticized its lack of enforceable provisions to prevent currency manipulation. Her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, has said that he will not pursue multilateral trade deals, only bilateral deals. McConnell said that he hopes the United States will continue its tradition as a trading nation since its founding, adding: To do that, its going to have to be done on a bipartisan basis. Earlier this month, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, said he saw no point in bringing up the TPP deal for a vote in any lame duck session of Congress later this year because we dont have the votes.

Hispanic coalition asks Trump to stop 'attacks',"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The National Hispanic Leadership Agenda on Thursday asked Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to stop attacks on Hispanic communities, inviting him in a letter to meet with the groups leadership. As we have expressed numerous times, your rhetoric of relentless attacks against our community is an issue of serious concern and has had a significant impact, fueling an alarming trend in our nation, the group, a coalition of 40 Latino nonpartisan advocacy organizations, wrote to Trump.

Clinton ramps up Asian outreach in three closely fought states,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clintons presidential campaign is focusing an effort to win over Asian American voters on three states where it believes the small but rapidly growing group could make the difference in her race against Republican Donald Trump.     The push in closely fought Nevada, Virginia and Pennsylvania follows a broader national effort by Clintons campaign to court minorities who are critical to her chances of winning the White House in the Nov. 8 election. Asians make up less than 3.5 percent of the U.S. population, but are the fastest-growing racial group in the country, according to the U.S. Census, due largely to net migration, making them more important than ever in an election.  Secretary Clinton understands the importance of the AAPI community and has launched a program that reflects that, reaching AAPI voters in unprecedented ways, said Jason Tengco, the Clinton campaigns outreach director for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI).  The three states were targeted because Asian voters could swing the outcome in the tight races between Trump and Clinton there.  The effort will include print, digital and broadcast advertising in a handful of Asian languages and more coordination among volunteer groups representing ethnic communities within the Asian American and Pacific Islander group, according to the campaign. Among the recent hires for the effort was Philip Kim, a Los Angeles native who previously worked with Senator Tim Kaine, Clintons running mate, as outreach director for Asian American and Pacific Islander voters in Nevada.  The campaign did not say how much the three-state push would cost.     While small, the Asian population could eclipse the margin of victory in each of the states Clinton is targeting. Asians  make up some 2.1 percent of eligible voters in Pennsylvania, 5 percent in Virginia and 9 percent in Nevada, according to APIAVote, a nonpartisan group.  Polling from Reuters/Ipsos shows Clinton with a mere 1 point lead over Trump in Pennsylvania, a 6 point lead in Virginia, and a 2 point lead in Nevada.  The challenge will be to get Asian Americans to the polls. Asian American voters have tended to lean Democrat but register to vote much less frequently than whites and blacks. Asian registration was about 56.3 percent in 2012, according to the Census, versus 73.1 percent for black voters and 71.9 percent for white voters.  The number of Asian Americans voting in presidential elections rose from 2008 to 2012, according to the Census, which showed 4.3 million Asian voters in 2012 and a turnout of 47.9 percent.  A big part of what were doing is voter registration, said Xochitl Hinojosa, a Clinton spokeswoman. Clintons campaign has already done significant Asian outreach. It launched the AAPI for Hillary campaign to engage Asian voters in January and has done phone calling in a range of languages for months. But the campaign said the latest push was the first with state-specific programs. The Clinton campaign is considering advertisements in Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean, Hindi, Urdu, Bengali and Chinese.  A spokesperson for Trumps campaign did not respond to requests for comment about its Asian outreach.  The Trump campaign has, however, recently made some efforts to appeal to black and Latino voters to undercut Clinton, including a meeting on Thursday with Latino and black Republicans in New York. Trump has had problems with minorities in the past and has  angered some with his hardline anti-immigration rhetoric. He has accused Mexico of sending rapists and drug dealers over the border, vowed to build a wall to stop them and called for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration to shore up U.S. national security. Clinton leads Trump by 12 percentage points nationally among likely voters, bolstered by minority support, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. ",politicsNews,"August 25, 2016 ",1

Chorus grows for Clintons to shutter charitable foundation,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Clinton Foundation, the family philanthropy of Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, should shut down or transfer operations to another charity despite its good work to avoid perceptions of pay-for-play, The Washington Post and USA Today said in editorials on Wednesday.  Despite plans announced earlier this week to reorganize the Clinton Foundation if Hillary Clinton wins the Nov. 8 election, USA Today said the global charity must close for the Democratic candidate to avoid any appearance of unethical ties.  The only way to eliminate the odor surrounding the foundation is to wind it down and put it in mothballs, starting today, and transfer its important charitable work to another large American charity such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the papers editorial board wrote.   The Gates Foundation declined to share its thoughts on the idea. We really cant speculate about the future of the Clinton Foundation, Amy Enright, a Gates Foundation spokeswoman, wrote in an email. The newspaper also published an editorial by Donna Shalala, the Clinton Foundations president, in which she argued that the foundation helps millions of people, especially in developing countries, and so scaling down its work was not simple. This suggestion ignores how global philanthropy works, and the reality that there are human beings around the world who would be affected by these decisions, Shalala wrote. The foundation announced on Monday that it would stop accepting at least some foreign and corporate donations if Clinton wins the presidency and that her husband, former President Bill Clinton, would resign from the foundations board. The Washington Post said in its editorial that these changes were insufficient and should have happened sooner, before Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. The foundation undoubtedly does worthwhile work, the Posts editorial board wrote. Should Ms. Clinton win, all of that work and all of the foundations assets should be spun off to an organization with no ties to the first family. The Clintons daughter, Chelsea Clinton, remains on the board of the charity, the full name of which is the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. The call from two leading U.S. news organizations came as Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and other members of his party have taken to calling for a special prosecutor to investigate what they say is corruption. The Clinton campaign has dismissed such calls as groundless political smears. Republicans see attacking Clinton over the organization as a way of unifying conservatives divided over Trump, who has never held elected officer and who often deviates from conservative orthodoxy. Democrats hope the controversy comes too late to make a difference in the election, in which most national public opinion polls show Clinton ahead.  The foundation has said Hillary Clinton was not involved with the group while serving as the nations top diplomat. The Clinton campaign denies Clinton ever took any action because of donations to the foundation. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told MSNBC on Wednesday that Clinton does not have a conflict of interest with charitable work, and pointed to her rivals business interests with Wall Street, China and Russia. Donald Trump and his bottom line and his networks are directly connected to all kinds of international entities ... and nobodys asking him to disclose or divest, Mook said of the New York businessman. Trump has responded by saying it is Clinton, not he, who has close ties to Russia. ",politicsNews,"August 24, 2016 ",1
Factbox: Why the Clinton Foundation draws both praise and criticism,"(Reuters) - Since announcing her presidential bid last year, Hillary Clinton has had to field questions about the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, her familys global philanthropy.  The non-profit group has been praised by health experts for helping to negotiate lower prices for HIV medicine in the developing world. But ethics experts and Clintons Republican opponents say its reliance on millions of dollars from foreign governments and powerful businesses makes her vulnerable to charges her donors could expect favorable treatment from the White House, which her campaign says is unfounded. * THE FOUNDATIONS HISTORYBill Clinton established the Clinton Foundation in 1997 to raise funds for his presidential archive in Little Rock, Arkansas, as he prepared to leave the White House. It has since grown into a complex global philanthropic organization, working to improve health and prospects in dozens of countries and to fight climate change. After leaving her job as U.S. secretary the state in 2013, Hillary Clinton joined the foundations board, and the organization was renamed the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation.  Later in 2015, Hillary Clinton left the foundation to run for president and in the August 2016 her husband said he will step down from the board if she wins. Their plans to remain with the foundation.* THE FOUNDATIONS WORK The foundation typically raises more than a quarter of a billion dollars each year in grants and donations. It spends about $200 million each year on programs and other expenses. The biggest program is the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which accounts for about two-thirds of the foundations annual expenses and focuses on reducing the cost and increasing the availability of medicine for HIV, malaria and other infections in developing countries.  The foundation also is involved in an array of other causes. It helps farmers in Africa increase yields and profits and tries to stop poachers from killing elephants there. It encourages American parents to read to their toddlers and schools to provide healthier environments for their students. It also helps Americans get access to loans to make their homes more energy efficient. Under the name Clinton Global Initiative, the foundation throws regular glitzy multi-day gatherings where people from politics, corporations and non-profit organizations to discuss philanthropy projects. CGI will hold its last such meeting in September before ending. In 2015, foundation officials admitted the charity breached an ethics agreement Clinton signed with the White House in order to become secretary of state. Under the agreement, she promised she would annually disclose the names of all donors to the charity and that it would seek State Department approval before accepting new money from foreign governments. The charities said not complying with the promises was a result of oversights. The foundation also admitted it had wrongly completed half a dozen annual tax returns that gave misleading figures about the amount of support it got from foreign governments, among other errors. After Reuters discovered the errors, the foundation apologized and refiled the returns. The foundation continued to accept money from foreigners, including foreign governments, and corporations while Clinton was secretary of state but has said it will introduce at least some limits on such donations if she becomes president.  Emails by Clinton and her staff released by the State Department show it was not unusual for foundation officials to help donors get access to Clinton, prompting experts in government ethics to raise concerns that the foundation gives rise to an appearance of a conflict of interest. Donald Trump, Clintons Republican rival for the presidency, has called for a special prosecutor to look into the foundation. Clintons campaign says any donor who expected special favors from Clinton in return would have been disappointed. ",politicsNews,"August 25, 2016 ",1
Lawsuit opens new front in Obama immigration legal fight,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Immigration advocates on Thursday mounted a long-shot effort to revive part of U.S. President Barack Obamas plan to shield millions of immigrants from deportation by filing a lawsuit challenging the national scope of a court order that blocked it. With favorable court rulings, the lawyers filing the lawsuit say it has the long-term potential to unravel decisions that blocked Obamas November 2014 plan nationwide. The White House program, if it had been fully implemented, could have allowed up to four million people with no legal immigration status to obtain work authorization. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in New York on behalf of Martin Batalla Vidal, 25, an immigrant from Mexico who has lived in the United States since he was seven and has benefited from the program.  He initially received a three-year work authorization, which has now been revoked due to a Texas judges ruling in February 2015 that blocked Obamas plan. Texas and 25 other states had challenged it. Vidal would still be eligible for a two-year work authorization under an earlier program, which has not been challenged and was not covered by the injunction. Vidals lawyers at the National Immigration Law Center say that if he wins, the ruling could have broad implications because it could help to eventually reinstate Obamas program for up to 60 percent of potential applicants in parts of the country not covered by the Texas ruling.  The Texas judges ruling was upheld on appeal. On June 23, the Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4 on the case, leaving the appeals court decision in place.  The court is currently one justice short following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February. The Supreme Court is currently considering whether to rehear the case once it has a full complement of justices. ",politicsNews,"August 25, 2016 ",1
Clinton to accuse Trump of embracing nativist political movement,"PALO ALTO, California (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton will accuse Donald Trump of embracing a brand of U.S. political conservatism associated with white nationalism and nativism when she makes a Nevada campaign stop on Thursday.  Aides said Clinton will link Trumps statements about immigration and religion to the rise of a political fringe movement in the U.S. known as the alternative right, which opposes multiculturalism and immigration. Clintons speech is an effort to keep attention focused on what a top aide called Trumps divisive and dystopian vision as he tries to reverse his slumping position in opinion polls in key battleground states before the Nov. 8 presidential election. Her campaign said Trumps recent installation of a new campaign leadership team was no indicator that he would move away from past statements criticizing the objectivity of an American judge of Mexican heritage or proposing to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. Trumps newly installed brain trust, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said in a statement, completes Donald Trumps disturbing takeover of the Republican Party. Republicans up and down the ticket are going to have to choose whether they want to be complicit in this lurch toward extremism or stand with voters who cant stomach it, he said. Trumps campaign declined to comment on Clintons campaign speech, but at a Mississippi rally on Wednesday, the Republican nominee called Clinton a bigot who sees people of color only as votes, not as human beings. Trump is set to meet with African-American leaders in New York City on Thursday and said he would unveil an immigration proposal within the next two weeks. In comments broadcast on Fox News on Wednesday night, Trump backed farther away from his hardline stance on deporting millions of illegal immigrants, saying he would be willing to work with those who have abided by U.S. laws while living in the country. When asked by CNN to respond to Trumps charge that she was a bigot on Wednesday evening, Clinton said he was taking a hate movement mainstream. Hes brought it into his campaign. Hes bringing it to our communities and our country, Clinton said. I will have more to say about thistomorrow. Her campaign cites Trumps decision to bring on Breitbart News executive Steve Bannon as his new campaign chief as a sign Trump is strengthening his ties to the alternative right movement. During Bannons tenure, Breitbart News increased its coverage of alt-right issues, and Bannon told the magazine Mother Jones during the Republican National Convention last month that the website was the platform for the alt-right. The term alt-right is used to describe a faction of political conservatives that have used the Internet in recent months to advance views of white supremacism, anti-Semitism and nativism.

Tech firms' encryption foe struggles for U.S. Senate re-election,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. senator seen by Silicon Valley as one of the technology industrys main foes in Congress is fighting for his political life as Donald Trumps slumping poll numbers threaten to damage Republican candidates across the board.          Senator Richard Burr from North Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is facing a strong and unexpected challenge from Democrat Deborah Ross.      Though tech policy is unlikely to decide the race, a Burr defeat would remove from the scene a lawmaker who has feuded with U.S. tech companies over digital privacy and encryption. Ross, a former head of the states chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, is fighting an uphill battle.  North Carolina has voted Republican in every presidential election from 1980 until 2008, when it backed Barack Obama by a thin margin. The state went for Republican Mitt Romney in 2012. Burr, 60, was not expected to face a challenge this year, in what he has said will be his last congressional campaign. But Republican presidential candidate Trumps numbers have slumped nationwide and in North Carolina, a battleground state in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Declining support for Trump, a property developer and television personality who has never held elected office, has put Burr, who endorsed Trump, and other Republicans in jeopardy, said Carter Wrenn, a Republican consultant in North Carolina. Were not sure its a wave here for Democrats, but its beginning to look that way, Wrenn said. Any Republican running down here ought to be very concerned about Trumps impact. A poll from NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist in early August showed Ross leading Burr 46 percent to 44 percent, though other polls have given Burr a narrow edge. Burr has been in Congress for more than 20 years and is distantly related to Aaron Burr, U.S. vice president in the early 1800s. If Burr were to lose, Democrats would be one seat closer to reclaiming a Senate majority from Republicans. The concerns of companies such as Apple Inc, Google and Facebook are not a key issue for North Carolina voters, but the races outcome could affect future handling of data encryption and privacy matters. For a year, Burr has been crafting legislation that would force Apple and other companies to weaken the security of their products in a way that would give U.S. law enforcement access to encrypted devices and communications. [uL2N18L28M] The FBI has said that the growth of strong default encryption makes it more difficult for investigators to access communications of criminal suspects, even with a warrant. Silicon Valley, cyber security experts and civil liberties advocates say strong encryption is essential to ward off hackers and maintain the overall security of the Internet. The encryption debate is decades old, but it boiled over earlier this year due to a dispute between Apple and the FBI over unlocking an iPhone linked to one of the shooters in a San Bernardino, Calif., rampage in 2015. Several U.S. tech companies and privacy groups, asking not to be named because they do not typically take public positions on candidates, told Reuters they are eager to see Burr lose. His efforts to require encryption backdoors in U.S. technology products are the main reason. While other lawmakers have been critical of Silicon Valley in the encryption debate, none has been as antagonistic as Burr, the sources said. Andrew McLaughlin, a former White House technology official who now is head of content at the publishing site Medium, tweeted in May: Trumps win endangers GOP Senators. Americas tech community should rally to defeat Richard Burr, for his idiotic war on Internet security. McLaughlin declined an interview request from Reuters.  Burr spokeswoman Becca Glover Watkins said the senator had worked closely with California Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the intelligence panel on the encryption issue. She said the two had worked on a number of bipartisan national security issues including their encryption proposal and Burr planned to continue engaging with tech companies on the challenges posed by encryption and cyber threats. Ross, a lawyer and former state legislator, has not clarified whether she sides with Apple in its dispute with the FBI. In a statement to Reuters, she said that protecting our law abiding citizens privacy doesnt mean sacrificing our security. Tech interests, so far, have not donated sizeable amounts of money to Ross, according to a review of contributions. However, Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, in June made an unspecified donation to Ross, according to U.S. Federal Election Commission records. The political action committee that supports Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat, vocal defender of encryption and frequent opponent of Burr, gave $5,000 to Ross this year. Burrs PAC later gave $5,000 to Wydens Republican challenger in Oregon. At a national level, Apple CEO Tim Cook and other tech executives have helped raise money for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Silicon Valley has almost universally shunned Trump, troubled largely by his rhetoric on immigration and his stated desire to shut down the Internet to fight extremists.

"Trump targets China trade, says plans serious measures","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump threatened on Wednesday to slap tariffs on Chinese products to show Beijing that the United States is not playing games anymore when it comes to leveling the field on trade. Addressing a rally in Tampa, Florida, Trump said that if he was elected in November, he would instruct the U.S. trade representative to bring cases against China both in the United States and at the World Trade Organization.  Tariffs would be necessary in some cases because they have to understand that were not playing games anymore, he added. Trump had previously pledged a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods. Trump said on Wednesday that the trade deficit with China was more than $500 billion, although the figure given by the U.S. government put it at $367 billion in 2015. The United States has brought cases against China at the WTO, and U.S. officials have frequently slapped antidumping and countervailing duties on Chinese products under U.S. law based on complaints brought by U.S. producers. We believe that whoever wins the U.S election, future U.S. leaders will continue to adopt a basic policy of mutual cooperation with China that accords with U.S. interests and the interests of the U.S. people, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters on Thursday. Trump, who is running behind Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in opinion polls, has pledged to return manufacturing jobs to America, although many economists believe that the China shock has long since passed. Economists at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere estimate that the China shock in the wake of the countrys accession to the WTO cost 800,000 to 1 million jobs in the United States. By way of comparison, U.S. manufacturing has shed 5 million jobs since 2000. ",politicsNews,"August 24, 2016 ",1
"Brexit leader Nigel Farage addresses Trump rally, bashes Clinton","JACKSON, Miss. (Reuters) - Nigel Farage, a key figure in the successful campaign to get Britain out of the European Union, lent his support to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday, saying Trump represented the same type of anti-establishment movement that he masterminded in his own country. Farage appeared with Trump before a cheering crowd of thousands at a rally in Jackson, Mississippi. Farage partly based his Brexit drive on opposition to mass immigration to Britain that he said was leading to rapid change in his country.  His appearance came as Trump sought to moderate his own hardline stance against illegal immigration. In remarks broadcast on Wednesday, Trump backed further away from his vow to deport millions of illegal immigrants, saying he would be willing to work with those who have abided by U.S. laws while living in the country. Trump summoned Farage on stage in the middle of his appearance, shook his hand and surrendered the microphone to him. Farage said he would not actually endorse Trump because he did not want to repeat what he called President Barack Obamas meddling in British affairs when Obama urged Britons to vote to stay in the EU. I cannot possibly tell you how you should vote in this election. But you know I get it, I get it. Im hearing you. But I will say this, if I was an American citizen I wouldnt vote for Hillary Clinton if you paid me, Farage said. In fact, I wouldnt vote for Hillary Clinton if she paid me, he added. Trump has sought to align himself with the Brexit movement, noting he had said before the June 23 referendum that Britons should vote to leave. He visited one of his golf courses in Scotland the day after the vote and boasted that he had predicted the outcome and called it a sign his own campaign would be successful. Trump has since tumbled in national opinion polls and is fighting to remain competitive with Democratic rival Clinton with little more than two months to go until the Nov. 8 election. November 8 is our chance to redeclare American independence, Trump said, borrowing a phrase Farage used during the Brexit campaign. Farage drew parallels between the Brexit movement and the support Trump has received from many Americans who feel left behind by Washington. They feel people arent standing up for them and they have in many cases given up on the whole electoral process and I think you have a fantastic opportunity here with this campaign, he said. Trumps comments on immigration came in the second part of an interview conducted on Tuesday with Fox News anchor Sean Hannity. They signaled a further softening in his immigration position as he tries to bolster support among moderate voters and minority groups. Trump, who defeated 16 rivals for the Republican presidential nomination in part based on his opposition to illegal immigrants, said he would not permit American citizenship for the undocumented population and would expel lawbreakers. To qualify to remain in the United States, Trump said, illegal immigrants would have to pay back taxes. No citizenship. Let me go a step further - theyll pay back taxes, they have to pay taxes, theres no amnesty, as such, theres no amnesty, but we work with them, Trump said. But when I go through and I meet thousands and thousands of people on this subject, and Ive had very strong people come up to me ... and theyve said: Mr. Trump, I love you, but to take a person whos been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and their family out, its so tough, Mr. Trump, Trump said. Its a very hard thing. Trump said he would outline his position soon. Well, Im going to announce something over the next two weeks, but its going to be a very firm policy, Trump told WPEC, a CBS affiliate in West Palm Beach, Florida. Trumps new position seemed to resemble in some respects the failed 2007 reform push by former Republican President George W. Bush. That effort offered a way to bring millions out of the shadows without amnesty and would have required illegal immigrants to pay a fine and take other steps to gain legal status.

Assange says WikiLeaks to release 'significant' Clinton campaign data,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - WikiLeaks founder and editor-in-chief Julian Assange said on Wednesday his organization planned to release significant information linked to the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton before the Nov. 8 election. Asked if the data could be a game-changer in the election, the Australian told Fox News in an interview conducted by satellite: I think its significant. You know, it depends on how it catches fire in the public and in the media. Assange has been living in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London for five years to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faces sexual assault accusations. He denies the allegations.   WikiLeaks released files in July of what it said were audio recordings pulled from the emails of the Democratic National Committee that were obtained by hacking its servers.  That release, during the Democratic National Convention where Clinton was officially named the partys presidential nominee, was the second batch in a series that deeply rattled the party and prompted the committees chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, to step down.  I dont want to give the game away, but its a variety of documents, from different types of institutions that are associated with the election campaign, some quite unexpected angles, some quite interesting, some even entertaining, Assange said when asked how the next revelations would compare with those in July WikiLeaks publishes leaked material, mostly from governments. In 2010, the organization published classified U.S. military and diplomatic documents in one of the largest information leaks in U.S. history. ",politicsNews,"August 25, 2016 ",1
California legislature passes climate change bills,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - California lawmakers voted to extend the states climate change fighting efforts out to 2030 on Wednesday, giving a new lease on life to the most ambitious greenhouse gas reduction program in the country. The state Senate voted 25-13 in support of a bill that sets a target of cutting the states output of heat-trapping emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.  The state is currently on track to meet its 2020 goal of reducing emissions back to 1990 levels.  The vote came hours after the state Assembly passed a linked bill to increase legislative oversight of the climate change programs run by the California Air Resources Board by a vote of 44-28. Both bills will now go to Governor Jerry Brown, who has said he will sign them.  Senator Fran Pavley, the author of the 2006 law that set the states first emission reduction target, said that effort has generated billions of dollars in investment in the states clean energy sector while creating jobs and reducing emissions.  Todays action will ensure the state remains on its prosperous and healthy course, she said.  At a press conference, Brown said the legislation would impact all industries in the state from oil refining and agriculture to building construction and public utilities.  Its about the world in which we live becoming decarbonized and sustainable, he said. These regulations will work to achieve that goal, he said.  Opponents said the emissions targets have caused job losses in the communities they represent.  The impacts in my county are immense, Senate Republican Leader Jean Fuller, who represents Bakersfield, said prior to the vote on Wednesday.  She said the current policies have driven hundreds of energy jobs out of her county, which is home to oil producers and manufacturers.  The changes it has brought to our economy are unforgiveable, she said. Lawmakers did not address a central threat to the states carbon cap-and-trade program from the California Chamber of Commerce, which has filed a lawsuit arguing that the states quarterly carbon permit auctions amount to an illegal tax on businesses. Both climate bills are silent on the question of what policy mechanisms - such as cap and trade - should be used to achieve the 2030 goal.  Brown, a staunch supporter of cap and trade, told reporters all options, including a ballot measure in 2018, were on the table to ensure the future of the carbon market.

Clinton calls for lower price on allergy drug EpiPen,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called on pharmaceutical company Mylan NV to voluntarily drop the price of its severe allergy treatment drug EpiPen, which has increased in price by more than 400 percent in the past decade. Thats outrageous - and its just the latest troubling example of a company taking advantage of its consumers, Clinton said in a statement. Its wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients, raising prices without justifying the value behind them. Clinton frequently said during the primary that she would fight pharmaceutical companies - part of an attempt to counter criticism that she was too closely tied to the insurance industry. She has released a proposal that she says will lower drug costs for consumers. Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin did not respond to inquiries about Clintons criticism of the company. Mylan acquired the product in 2007, and the price increased from $100 in 2008 to its current cost of $600. Shares of Mylan closed down more than 5 percent at $43.15 on the Nasdaq. The price of EpiPen is outrageous, said Robert Weissman, president of consumer watchdog group Public Citizen. Mylan is endangering lives and ripping off the country. Weissman said EpiPens U.S. price should be rolled back sharply, noting the product is available for as little as $112 in Canada. Many other drugmakers also routinely raise prices of their prescription drugs by 10 percent or more each year, and U.S. legislation is needed to prevent such price spikes, he added. The White House took a more cautious tone in criticizing rising drug costs, refusing to comment on the decisions of an individual company.  I will observe, however, that pharmaceutical companies that often try to portray themselves as the inventors of life-saving medication often do real damage to their reputation by being greedy and jacking up prices in a way that victimizes, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at a news briefing.     Clinton joins a bipartisan group of lawmakers who are calling for investigations into the price increase of EpiPens, which are preloaded injections of epinephrine (adrenaline) that people use if they are having a dangerous allergic reaction that untreated could result in death.  Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote Mylan earlier in the week to ask for an explanation of the price change. Senator Amy Klobuchar, the top Democrat on the committees antitrust subcommittee, called for an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. On Wednesday, Republican Senator Susan Collins and Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill requested that Mylan provide a briefing for the Senate to explain the price change. Grassley and Klobuchar, along with Democratic Senators Patrick Leahy and Richard Blumenthal and Republican Senator Ron Johnson, on Wednesday said they had written to the Food and Drug Administration to ask about its approval process for alternatives to the EpiPen. Given the importance of this topic, it is imperative to understand the FDAs role with respect to EpiPens and its approval of generic equivalents that could help to increase competition and lower prices if introduced, the senators said in a statement.   We have reached out to every member of Congress who has sent us a letter, and we look forward to meeting with them and responding to their questions as soon as possible, Devlin said.  In January, Clinton admonished Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc, which raised the price of a heart drug. In the wake of a Clinton campaign blog post targeting Valeant, the companys stock fell. In March, she released a campaign ad vowing to target the company specifically.  Clinton also criticized Turing Pharmaceuticals in the fall of 2015 when public ire rose after it decided to raise the price of an antiviral medication commonly used by AIDS patients and pregnant women from $13.50 a tablet to $750 each.  After a single post by Clinton on the social media website Twitter critical of Turing, the companys stock price tumbled.  At that time, Clinton released a comprehensive drug price plan that she says would reduce costs. Her proposal includes capping monthly out-of-pocket costs, expanding generic drug access and allowing Americans to buy pharmaceuticals abroad.  Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has said little about lowering drug prices. He has proposed increasing the amount of negotiations permitted by Medicare in order to lower prices for those using the program. ",politicsNews,"August 24, 2016 ",1
Trump adviser's Russia credentials come under scrutiny,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - When Donald Trump named a little-known U.S. energy consultant as part of his foreign policy team, the advisers ex-boss was puzzled; how could the relatively junior banker he knew in Moscow a decade ago be qualified to brief a presidential candidate? Carter Page, who worked in Russia at U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch, paints an impressive picture of his three-year stint from 2004, saying on his companys website that he advised on key transactions involving some of the countrys biggest energy groups. But Sergey Aleksashenko, who became head of the banks Moscow operation toward the end of Pages assignment, expressed  doubts about whether he has the experience to act as an adviser on Washingtons fraught ties with the Kremlin. For me it was a strange choice, said Aleksashenko, who served as a deputy finance minister and deputy central bank governor in the 1990s before running Merrill Russia in 2006-2008. Carter was never a person who would discuss foreign policy or U.S.-Russian relations.  The achievements of Page - whom Trump named as an adviser in March - are summarized on the website of New York-based Global Energy Capital LLC, a firm that he founded after leaving Merrill. He did not respond to Reuters questions about his time in Russia and Merrill Lynch declined comment. When contacted by Reuters, Trumps spokeswoman Hope Hicks played down Pages role in the campaign. Mr. Page is an informal adviser named as part of a much larger group several months ago. He does not speak for or represent the campaign in any official capacity, she said. Trump, who is now the Republican nominee, named Page as being among five foreign policy advisers in an interview with The Washington Post on March 21. Hicks did not answer Reuters questions seeking to clarify what Page had done since then for the campaign and why Trump had picked him.     Aleksashenko, a Kremlin critic, was Pages boss in 2006-07 and is now a nonresident senior fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institution in Washington.   Three other former Merrill employees in Moscow also told Reuters that Page could not have played a leading role in the banks deals due to his rank, and at the time showed no real interest or expertise in foreign policy. Shortly after Trump named his foreign affairs team,  campaign member Sam Clovis said the aim was to recruit people with real-world and military experience rather than the retreads that other candidates relied on. These are people who work for a living, the New York Times quoted Clovis as saying. If youre looking for show ponies, youre coming to the wrong stable. Clovis was not immediately available for further comment. Russia has been a central issue in the U.S. election campaign, with Trump calling President Vladimir Putin a strong leader. Flattering coverage of Trump in Russian state media has left little doubt that he would be the Kremlins preferred candidate over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Like Trump, Page holds views that contradict the Obama administrations stance on Russia and in recent years he has expressed them, reflecting the Kremlins views on occasions. In a February 2015 article in the journal Global Policy, he said U.S. policy toward Russia had been misguided and provocative and blamed the State Department for precipitating the Ukraine conflict. In a speech given in Moscow last month, Page also criticized Western countries for what he said was their hypocritical focus on democratization in the post-Soviet world. At the event, he did not respond to questions about his time in Russia. Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, said Trump wanted to show the incompetence and weakness of the foreign policy pursued by the Democrats. Page was useful as his views fit with that aim, added Kortunov, who does not know the Trump adviser personally. There are people in the U.S. who are bored with Ukraine, who think it is not an American problem that Washington should be involved in, said Kortunov, whose think tank is close to the Russian Foreign Ministry but who has also expressed independent views.  Despite Hickss comments, Trumps former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told Reuters that when he left the campaign in late June, Page had definitely been an adviser to Trump. Another member of the five-strong foreign policy team, Walid Phares, told Reuters on Aug. 19 that Page continued to advise Trump. A MID-TIER BANKER The Global Energy Capital LLC website says Page was responsible for opening Merrills Moscow office and that he was an advisor on key transactions for Russian firms including Gazprom, the worlds top gas producer, and RAO UES, a power company that no longer exists. Reuters spoke to four former Merrill employees in Moscow, three of whom overlapped with Page, as well as three Moscow-based bankers who competed with the U.S. bank for business.  With the exception of Aleksashenko, none agreed to speak on the record about their recollections which differ from Pages. Page was a vice president at Merrill, a mid-tier banker who was not originating deals, said Aleksashenko. Gazprom was a VIP client and in no transaction with such a client could a vice president play a decisive role.  In an interview with Bloomberg in March, Page said he advised Gazprom on the purchase of a stake in the Sakhalin energy project in Russias Far East from Shell. Aleksashenko said Merrills contribution to that deal was merely to provide a straightforward document saying the transaction was at fair value to Gazprom shareholders, alongside other banks. Gazprom declined comment. Another ex-Merrill banker said: Page was a general dogsbody who would have sat in on most meetings and prepared documents. A third ex-Merrill banker, whose comments were corroborated by Aleksashenko, said Merrills business with Gazprom when Page worked there involved investor relations work. Page also said he worked on deals in central Asia. Two sources who were involved in the initial public offering of shares in Kazakh firm KazMunaiGas EP in 2006 said although Merrill was one of the IPOs managers, they did not remember Page participating in the deal. Bankers at rivals when Page worked in Moscow said Merrill was not the main bank Gazprom turned to when it needed to raise capital, although the U.S. bank handled its investor relations.  Merrill did act as a manager on two Gazprom Eurobonds when Page worked in Moscow but Tom Adshead at Moscow-based consultancy Macro-Advisory, which helps foreign investors in Russia, said it was not a major player with the energy group. There are other bankers who were viewed in the market as being closer to the company, said Adshead, who worked in Moscow as an analyst and was a fund manager at the time that Page was at Merrill. Merrill Lynch declined to respond to Reuters questions on Pages work with the bank in Moscow.  ",politicsNews,"August 24, 2016 ",1
"Exclusive: Clinton leads Trump in key swing states, would likely win election - poll"," NEW YORK (Reuters) - If the U.S. presidential election were held today, Democrat Hillary Clinton would win the key swing states of Florida, Ohio and Virginia and have a 95 percent chance of beating Republican Donald Trump to become Americas first female president, according to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project.  The project, which combines opinion polls with an analysis of voting patterns under different election scenarios, shows Clinton currently beating Trump in the popular vote by six percentage points and ahead in 19 states, including most of the larger-population ones that heavily influence the outcome of the election.  At the moment, Clinton would win at least 268 votes in the Electoral College, the body that ultimately chooses the next president, just two shy of what she needs to win the White House. On average, the former secretary of state would win by 108 electoral college votes.  Trump would win at least 21 states, many of them with smaller populations, giving him a minimum of 179 electoral votes.  The election is still 10 weeks away, and a great deal could change prior to Nov 8. The candidates are running about even in eight states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina, and the polling sample is too small to determine the winner in Alaska, Wyoming and Washington D.C. But Trump would need to win the 21 states currently in his column and sweep all of the remaining toss-up states to win the presidency.  That is a steep challenge for Trump, whose bare-knuckled, anti-establishment campaign helped him win the Republican Partys nomination but has so far failed to build broad support with voters.  If Trump cannot draw in far greater numbers of women, moderate Republican voters and minorities, he will almost surely lose the White House race, according to the polling project.  Consider, for example, what would be an ideal scenario for Trump: white men with below-average incomes showing up in record numbers on Election Day. This group strongly favors the real-estate mogul, yet even if all of them vote it wouldnt hand Trump any of the states currently slated for Clinton or any of the toss-up states. Clinton would still win the election.  The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project is driven by an online survey that gathers responses from about 16,000 people per week. Respondents answer questions about their demographic background, their party affiliation and their choice for president. Their responses are weighted according to the latest population estimates, and each respondent is ranked according to their likelihood to vote.  Once the poll is complete, the project tallies the levels of support and estimated error for both candidates, and then runs multiple election simulations given their respective support. A separate set of simulations is run for each state and Washington D.C. The project runs more than 25 million simulations to determinethe chances that one candidate would win.  Representatives from the Clinton and Trump campaigns did not respond to requests for comment on the project.  A polarizing candidate, Trump has called for a more extensive border wall with Mexico, a ban on Muslim immigrants and a rejection of international trade agreements. His personal attacks, including his criticism of the parents of a Muslim-American soldier killed in action, have undermined his support within the Republican establishment.  Still, Clinton is far from guaranteed a victory in November.  A majority of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of both Trump and Clinton, and nearly one out of four likely voters says they do not support either of them for president, according to a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll.  The candidates are scheduled to square off in a series of televised debates, and a poor showing by either could quickly change the dynamic of the race. A strong showing by a third party candidate could also influence the outcome.  Democratic Party operatives also fear there may be more revelations about ties between wealthy foreign donors to the Clinton family charity, the Clinton Foundation, and the State Department under her stewardship. Clinton has denied any impropriety but Trump has seized on the disclosures as a new line of attack against his rival.  Theres always a chance of an October surprise  something definitive and striking about Clinton  that could change the race, said Tom Smith, who directs the Center for the Study of Politics and Society at the University of Chicago. But, short of any scandals by the Clintons, I just dont see any way that Trump catches up.  If Trump were to rely heavily on support from white voters, he would face an extremely narrow path to victory. Even if all male and female white voters showed up at the polls, and turnout among blacks and Hispanics was half of what it was in 2012, respectively, the project shows Clinton would still be favored to win.  It appears that Trumps best chance is to turn out Republican voters in huge numbers and hope that a lot of Democrats stay home.  Theres only one problem with this: Republicans appear to have turned out as strongly as Democrats only once in presidential elections since at least 1976. That was in 2004, when the electorate was made up of 37 percent of Republicans, 37 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Independents, according to exit poll data collected by the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at Cornell University.  Theres still a lot of this demolition derby of an election to go, said Donald Green, a political scientist at Columbia University. A lot of people who support Trump dont have a very good record of voter turnout, and who knows if they show up this time.  ",politicsNews,"August 24, 2016 ",1
Trump suggests potential softening in hardline position on immigration,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump held out the possibility on Tuesday of a softening of his hardline position on illegal immigration, a move that could help move him to the political center but hurt him with his most ardent supporters. In an immigration town hall event with Fox News anchor Sean Hannity, Trump was asked whether he would be willing to change U.S. law to accommodate those illegal immigrants who have been contributing to American society, obeyed laws and have children. There certainly can be a softening because were not looking to hurt people, Trump replied, insisting there were some great people among the immigrant population. It was the latest example of Trump appearing to waver on his long-held stance he would deport all illegal immigrants back to their home countries. His new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told CNN on Sunday that Trumps proposed deportation force for the 11 million people in the United States illegally was to be determined. Later on Tuesday, at a rally in Austin, Trump appeared to shift his emphasis to dealing with illegal immigrants who commit crimes in the United States. He brought on stage eight mothers whose children were killed by illegal immigrants. Trump ticked off a series of statistics about crimes committed by some illegal immigrants and vowed that would be stopped under his presidency. Not going to happen, folks, he said. Were not going to let it happen to our country. Trump, who postponed an immigration speech originally planned for Thursday in Denver, said he would stop some major cities practice of providing sanctuary for illegal immigrants and stop immigrants from overstaying their visas. A move by Trump to modify his stance on immigration could help him attract more support among moderate voters in his uphill drive to win the Nov. 8 election. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Democrat Hillary Clinton expanding her lead over Trump to 12 points among likely voters, with 45 percent support to 33 percent for Trump. But a change in Trumps position could prove to be dispiriting to some of his strongest supporters. Trump defeated 16 rivals for the Republican presidential nomination and one factor that helped him was being the most hardline candidate on immigration.  Why would anyone be surprised that Trump has pivoted to becoming the amnesty candidate? said Republican strategist Rick Tyler, a former spokesman for U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a conservative. When you have no governing philosophy, pivots are par for the course. Guess we wont need Mexico to build that wall. At his Austin event, attended by thousands who packed a rodeo arena, some were shouting: Build the wall long before Trump even showed up, a reference to the New York businessmans oft-stated promise to build a wall along the U.S. with Mexico and make Mexico pay for it. Some of those attending the event, however, liked that Trump might be offering a more expansive view on immigration. I think hes saying the law needs to be looked at, said Barbara Thomas, a Trump supporter from the Austin area. I think it would be very hard for all of them to be deported. I think the system needs to be fixed. It has some problems. Immigration politics have long divided American voters. Then-President George W. Bush, a Republican, fought for changes to U.S. immigration laws in 2007 but the effort fizzled in the U.S. Congress. Democratic President Barack Obamas attempts have failed to bear fruit amid partisan gridlock. Trump insisted in the Hannity appearance he would follow the law. We have very strong laws in this country. And you know Bush, and even Obama, sends people back. Now, we can be more aggressive on that but we want to follow the laws, he said. His vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike  Pence, said in a CBS News interview that Trump would be tough but fair in dealing with illegal immigrants. People who have run afoul of the law gotta leave immediately, Pence said. When pressed, he said the details would need to be worked out with Congress. ",politicsNews,"August 24, 2016 ",1
Brexit campaigner Farage says to address Trump rally,"LONDON (Reuters) - Nigel Farage, an anti-immigration politician who was a figurehead of the successful campaign to get Britain out of the European Union, intends to address a Donald Trump rally on Wednesday, a spokesman said. Once dismissed by then-prime minister David Cameron as the leader of a party mostly consisting of fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists, Farage had his revenge when the June 23 Brexit referendum went his way, forcing Cameron to resign.  Trump, the U.S. Republican Partys presidential nominee, applauded the Brexit result, seeing the blow to British and EU political elites as a good omen for November when he hopes anti-establishment fervor will send him to the White House. Farage will tell Trumps rally in Mississippi the story of the Brexit campaign, the spokesman said.  There was no immediate confirmation from the Trump campaign. Farages future is unclear. He stepped down as head of the UK Independence Party  (UKIP) after the referendum delivered what he said was the main ambition of his 25-year political career - Britain leaving the EU. Often seen as an abrasive and controversial figure, Farage was marginalized by the official Vote Leave campaign which deemed him too divisive. He instead toured the country in a double-decker bus painted in UKIPs color, purple. ",politicsNews,"August 24, 2016 ",1

Hillary Clinton to receive intelligence briefing Saturday: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is scheduled to receive a pre-election briefing from U.S. intelligence officials on Saturday, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.	 Clinton, a former secretary of state, will receive the briefing, an overview of foreign policy and international security issues facing the United States, from career officials in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the source said.  CNN reported that the briefing would be given to Clinton at the Federal Bureau of Investigations field office in White Plains, New York, not far from the Chappaqua, New York, residence she shares with her husband, former President Bill Clinton.  Representatives for relevant government agencies and Clintons presidential campaign had no immediate comment. ODNI officials gave Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump his first intelligence briefing last week at the FBIs Manhattan office. A source said that because Trump asked for his briefing to be broken up into more than one session, he is expected to meet again with intelligence briefers. Questions have been raised about the extent to which either candidate should be trusted with national security secrets, given the controversies surrounding the private email server Clinton used for State Department business and Trumps penchant for spontaneous comments and tweets. Sources familiar with the content of the briefings said that while they contain information classified at the Top Secret level, they do not contain information about undercover espionage operations or U.S. intelligence sources and methods.

Clinton leads Trump by 12 points in Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican rival Donald Trump by 12 percentage points among likely voters, her strongest showing this month, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday. The Aug. 18-22 poll showed that 45 percent of voters supported Clinton, while 33 percent backed Trump ahead of the Nov. 8 election.  Clinton, the former U.S. secretary of state, has led Trump, a New York businessman, throughout most of the 2016 campaign. But her latest lead represents a stronger level of support than polls indicated over the past few weeks. Earlier in August, Clintons lead over Trump ranged from 3 to 9 percentage points in the poll.  The poll also found that about 22 percent of likely voters would not pick either candidate. That lack of support is high compared with how people responded to the poll during the 2012 presidential election between Democratic President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney. Those who are wavering right now are just as likely to be thinking about supporting a third-party candidate instead, and not between Clinton and Trump, said Tom Smith, who directs the Center for the Study of Politics and Society at the University of Chicago. During the latest polling, Clinton faced renewed scrutiny about her handling of classified emails while serving as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, and Trumps campaign chief, Paul Manafort, resigned after a reshuffle of the candidates campaign leadership team.       Clinton held a smaller lead in a separate four-way poll that included Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party. Among likely voters, 41 percent supported Clinton, while 33 percent backed Trump. Johnson was backed by 7 percent and Stein by 2 percent. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. Both presidential polls included 1,115 respondents and had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.  ",politicsNews,"August 23, 2016 ",1
Kansas asks U.S. appeals court to reinstate strict voter ID rule,"DENVER (Reuters) - Kansas on Tuesday asked a U.S. appeals court to reinstate rules requiring proof of U.S. citizenship from people registering to vote, the latest political battle over stringent identification laws enacted in Republican-led states ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The mandate that Kansans present passports, birth certificates or other proof of citizenship when registering to vote while obtaining drivers licenses was challenged by a U.S. District Court judge in May. Her ruling restored the right to vote in the Nov. 8 election for thousands of people who were asked if they wanted to register while at motor vehicle offices, but not required to submit the additional documentation. Judge Julie Robinson ordered those people to be re-registered. She said that Kansas could identify only three non-citizens who voted between 2003 and the onset of the law in 2013. Kansas law is one of the strictest voter identification statutes in the country, making the state a symbol for mostly Republican Party supporters who say the rules are meant to prevent voter fraud. Opponents, mostly Democrats, say they discriminate against minorities. Every time a noncitizen votes, it effectively cancels out the vote of a citizen, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach said in court filings ahead of Tuesdays oral arguments. In arguments before the Denver-based U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, Kobach said, We dont need to be authorized by the federal government to set up rules to manage state and local elections. Arguing for the lower courts decision to be upheld, the American Civil Liberties Union specifically targeted a portion of Kansas law that deals with people who register to vote at motor vehicle department offices. The ACLU argued that the requirement conflicts with a federal law from 1993 aimed at making it easier for people to register to vote by doing so when they apply for a drivers license.  Because that law does not require people to bring more documentation than they would need to get a drivers license, Robinson ruled that about 18,000 people whose registration had been invalidated by the state should be re-registered. Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump, who earlier this month said that voters who opposed his candidacy are going to vote 10 times, is asking supporters to volunteer to be election observers at the polls. He routinely calls Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton crooked and has said that if he loses, it will be because the system is rigged against him. Led by lawyers from the ACLU, opponents of the voter identification laws have filed lawsuits in several states, successfully overturning or delaying implementation of some statutes.  Last month, a federal judge in Wisconsin ruled that voters who do not have photo identification will be able to vote in the  presidential election, and the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a North Carolina law requiring voters to bring a photo ID to the polls. Seventeen states have put new voting restrictions in place since the last presidential contest, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law.

Illinois governor's office warns of crippling pension payment hike,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Potential action this week by Illinois biggest public pension fund could put a big dent in the states already fragile finances, Governor Bruce Rauners administration warned. A Monday memo from a top Rauner aide said the Teachers Retirement System (TRS) board could decide at its meeting this week to lower the assumed investment return rate, a move that would automatically boost Illinois annual pension payment.  If the (TRS) board were to approve a lower assumed rate of return taxpayers will be automatically and immediately on the hook for potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in higher taxes or reduced services, Michael Mahoney, Rauners senior advisor for revenue and pensions, wrote to the governors chief of staff, Richard Goldberg. When TRS lowered the investment return rate to 7.5 percent from 8 percent in 2014 the states pension payment increased by more than $200 million, according to the memo.  Illinois fiscal 2017 pension payment to its five retirement systems was estimated at $7.9 billion, up from $7.617 billion in fiscal 2016 and $6.9 billion in fiscal 2015, according to a March report by a bipartisan legislative commission. The countrys fifth-largest states unfunded pension liability stood at $111 billion at the end of fiscal 2015, with TRS accounting for more than 55 percent of that gap. The funded ratio was a weak 41.9 percent. An impasse between the Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature left Illinois as the only state without a complete 2016 budget. A six-month fiscal 2017 spending plan was passed in June. Mahoney cautioned that unforeseen and unknown automatic cost increases would have a devastating impact on Illinois ability to fund social services and education. One of Rauners top Republican legislative allies, Senate Minority Leader Christine Radogno, urged the TRS board to delay a vote Friday to give the public time to weigh in on its possible actions. This issue is important enough at the very least to put the TRS board on notice we dont want them taking any action that could cost taxpayers $200 to $300 million without appropriate scrutiny, she said. TRS spokesman Dave Urbanek said the pension system was not aware of Mahoneys memo until Tuesday and that Rauners office had requested information about the scenarios under consideration. He added TRS did not offer potential scenarios either to the governors office or legislative leaders and noted the TRS board has not yet discussed the matter. ",politicsNews,"August 23, 2016 ",1
Clinton details plans to boost small businesses,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton on Tuesday vowed to make starting a small business in the United States as easy as opening a lemonade stand if elected president, targeting a large economic sector and a significant voting bloc.  Her flagship proposal is to establish a standard tax deduction for small businesses, previously only available to individuals, allowing owners to get tax relief without filing additional forms.  Clinton would also expand healthcare tax credits in the Affordable Care Act for small businesses that employ up to 50 workers and create new federal incentives for local and state governments to streamline the business licensing process, according to background provided by her campaign. Since launching her campaign in April 2015, Clinton has said she wants to be the small business president if she wins the Nov. 8 election against businessman Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Trump has offered lower tax rates for small businesses and cuts to federal regulations to help jump-start America. Clintons campaign held a conference call with small business owners on Tuesday to discuss her proposals and offer ways they could help with the former secretary of states campaign. You will always have a seat at the table, Clinton told business owners on the call, taking questions from entrepreneurs in Virginia and Michigan. Small businesses play a vital economic role in the United States, making up 99.7 percent of U.S. employer firms and providing 49.2 percent of U.S. private-sector jobs, according to the Small Business Administration.  The proposals announced by Clintons campaign on Tuesday fill in details on how the Democratic nominee would fulfill promises to improve access to financing and minimize regulatory burdens that make it difficult to start small businesses. They tell me more dreams die in the parking lots of banks than anywhere in America, Clinton said of the feedback she has received from small business owners. Id like to get rid of the unnecessary red tape, Clinton said of regulations on credit unions and small banks that make it difficult to lend to would-be entrepreneurs.  Clintons campaign said she also wants to guarantee that small businesses with questions about U.S. government regulations receive an answer within 24 hours. Clintons running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, discussed the new proposals during a Tuesday roundtable with small business owners in Colorado, a battleground state.

"Texas, four other states sue over U.S. transgender health policy","AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Texas and four other states sued the Obama administration on Tuesday over extending its healthcare nondiscrimination law to transgender individuals, saying the move represents a radical invasion of the federal bureaucracy into a doctors medical judgment. Texas, along with Wisconsin, Nebraska, Kentucky and Kansas sued on behalf three medical organizations, two of which are affiliated with Christian groups.  They argue the medical groups would be forced to violate their religious beliefs and perform harmful medical transition procedures or else suffer massive financial liability, according to the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, named as a defendant in the suit, was not immediately available for comment. On Sunday, a judge for the same district blocked an Obama administration policy that public schools should allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice, granting a nationwide injunction sought by 13 states, led by Texas. The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was passed in 2010 and included anti-discrimination provisions to prevent insurers from charging customers more or denying coverage based on age or sex. That law left some areas open to interpretation and thousands of consumers complain each year about being discriminated against, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said last year. The U.S. government said in September it would broaden its nondiscrimination law to transgender individuals and require health insurers and medical providers to treat all patients equally, regardless of sex.

"In attacking Clinton foundation, Trump seeks a Republican rallying cry","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After struggling to find a consistent message and consolidate party support, Donald Trump is honing his attack on Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton and the foundation bearing her familys name in hopes of making it a rallying cry for fellow Republicans. Trump began hammering the Democrat this week over the Clinton Foundation, an organization created by her and her husband former President Bill Clinton that funds aid programs in developing countries.  On Monday, Trump called for the foundation to be shut down and for a special prosecutor to be named to investigate it. In particular, he accused Clinton of having turned the charity into a pay-for-play scheme in which wealthy donors to the organization got favors from the State Department while Clinton was secretary of state from 2009-2013. The Clinton campaign denied that, saying Clinton never took any action because of donations to the foundation. After a primary campaign that left the party bitterly divided, Trump has struggled to find an attack line that fellow Republicans can rally behind. His criticism of the parents of a dead Muslim American soldier who spoke at the Democratic National Convention drew strong rebukes from many in his own party. His attacks on Clintons health have been dismissed as conspiracy theories.  Clinton, who leads in nearly every national and swing state opinion poll ahead of the Nov. 8 election, has largely avoided criticism about the foundation, although there was a spate of media investigations last year after she announced she was running for president. Her main Democratic rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, did not attack her on that front during the primary campaign. The focus on the foundation is likely to build some confidence among Republicans that Trumps campaign is healing internal divisions. Last week, Trump shook up his campaigns top leadership, putting Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway in top jobs. Campaign chairman Paul Manafort resigned. Chris Collins, a Republican member of Congress, said supporters have been urging Trump to focus on Clinton.  Anything we can do to put her character forefront in the campaign is going to help Donald Trump, Collins said in a phone interview. Republican Chairman Reince Preibus said if Trump continues  to remain measured, he could be tied or ahead in the polls by the first week in September. Recent Reuters/Ipsos opinion polls have found Clinton increasing her lead over Trump during August. The latest poll, on Monday, showed Clinton at 45 percent, and Trump at 33 percent. Clintons campaign has pushed back at the attack. Clinton spokesman Robby Mook said the foundation will not shut down given its humanitarian work, and he did not see it hurting Clintons lead in polls. This is an absurd call by Donald Trump. It is an act of desperation on his campaign given the turmoil that weve seen from his campaign in recent weeks, he told MSNBC. Trump abandoned plans to deliver a policy speech on Thursday about immigration. The postponement came as signs of internal disagreement on his immigration policy became public, but the move also allowed him to focus on what he and his advisers see as a Clinton weakness.  The foundation has long been a potential liability for Clinton. The fact it accepted corporate and foreign donations sparked criticism that it represented a conflict of interest while Clinton was secretary of state. On Sunday, the foundation announced it would no longer accept foreign donations if Clinton is elected and that the group is prepared to hand off programs to other charity organizations. Democrats are hopeful Trump is making an issue of the foundation too late for it to make a difference.  Most American voters already have an opinion of Hillary Clinton, said Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist who once worked for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.  The views are pretty hardened on both sides, and I dont think anything is going to move that needle, he said. Both Clinton and Trump have unusually high unfavorable ratings among voters, although Trump currently scores worse on that score, opinion polls show.  The dual controversies over the foundation and over Clintons use of a private server and email account while secretary of state dovetailed on Monday. Conservative legal group Judicial Watch sought to make the case that previously unreleased emails provide evidence that Clinton offered access to donors to the foundation while she was secretary of state.

Appeals court upholds Ohio law that shortens early voting,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld an Ohio law passed in 2014 that shortened the states early voting period and abolished a so-called Golden Week when residents could register and cast ballots in the same week. The 2-1 decision from a panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reverses a May ruling by U.S. District Judge Michael Watson who struck down the law that limited early voting, saying it violated voters rights. Tuesdays ruling is the latest in a flurry of legal battles over state voting rules ahead of the Nov. 8 election, including stricter voter identification laws in some states and laws on the voting rights of felons in others. . Ohio has long been a battleground swing state in presidential elections where Democrats and Republicans are tightly matched. Ohios Republican-controlled legislature abolished Golden Week and shortened early voting to 29 days from 35 days, which critics said directly limited opportunities for minority participation in elections. Civil rights groups the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People had challenged the law, but their arguments were not accepted by the majority opinion at the appeals court. In the ruling on an appeal filed by the state government the judges said Ohio is a national leader when it comes to early voting, allowing people to vote early and in person for four weeks. This is really quite generous, the ruling said. The ruling said the challenged law does not result in injury under the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act and that despite the changes, Ohio continues to provide generous, reasonable, and accessible voting options to all Ohioans.

Biden tells Baltic states: Don't take Trump seriously,"RIGA (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden told Baltic leaders on Tuesday not to take seriously comments by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump that called into question the U.S. commitment to protect NATO allies in the face of Russian aggression. On a trip to Latvia, Biden suggested Trump, who has never held elected office, did not understand NATOs mutual defense guarantee, known as Article Five. I want to make it absolutely clear to all the people in Baltic states: we have pledged our sacred honor, the United States of America ... to the NATO treaty and Article Five, Biden, a Democrat, said in the Latvian capital. The fact that you occasionally hear something from a presidential candidate in the other party, its ... nothing that should be taken seriously, Biden said. Bidens visit comes amid heightened tensions with Russia in the region and some nervousness among allies about Trump, who has suggested he might abandon NATOs pledge to defend all alliance members automatically if elected. Both Democrats and Republicans supported the NATO pledge, said Biden, who made his remarks during an appearance with the leaders of all three Baltic states in Riga. There is continued overwhelming bipartisan commitment in the United States of America in both political parties to maintain our commitment to NATO, he said. Trump is running against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who has also affirmed her commitment to NATO. Clinton is ahead in polls.   Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, the three Baltic states which regained independence in the early 1990s a half century after being annexed by the Soviet Union, see themselves on the frontline of any potential conflict with Russia. NATO leaders agreed last month to deploy military forces to the Baltic states and eastern Poland for the first time and increase air and sea patrols to reassure allies in the region worried about the threat from Moscow. It is important for us that we are ready, all parties, to confirm our strategic partnership ... and we are sure that no matter what changes will be after the elections in (the) United States, their commitments ... to NATO, to (the) Baltic region, will stay, said Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite, speaking after Biden.    Russia often depicts NATO as an aggressor whose members are moving troops and military hardware further into former Soviet territory, which it regards as its sphere of influence. On Wednesday, Biden travels to Turkey where he will meet President Tayyip Erdogan and Prime Minister Binali Yildirim before visiting Sweden to discuss Europes asylum crisis.

U.S. CBO says budget deficit to reach $590 billion for fiscal 2016,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. budget deficit is expected to grow to $590 billion in fiscal year 2016 due to slower than expected growth in revenues and higher spending for programs including Social Security and Medicare, the Congressional Budget Office said on Tuesday. The estimate, which is $56 billion larger than CBOs forecast in March, shows the deficit increasing in relation to economic output for the first time since 2009. CBO said the deficit is expected to be $152 billion higher than in 2015 and will equal 3.2 percent of economic output. The deficit peaked at $1.4 trillion in 2009 and shrank to $485 billion in 2014. The nonpartisan research agency also said that debt held by the public will amount to nearly 77 percent of gross domestic product by the end of 2016, three percentage points higher than last year and its highest ratio since 1950. The 2016 federal fiscal year ends Sept. 30. Revenues have increased by less than 1 percent in 2016, while government outlays are predicted to rise by 5 percent as a result of mandatory spending for Social Security and Medicare, the federal retirement and healthcare programs for the elderly.    The CBO said the forecast indicates tepid U.S. economic growth of only 1 percent for the first half of calendar year 2016 but predicted the economy would expand more robustly in coming months and create growth of 2 percent for the year and 2.4 percent for 2017. Faster growth will spur hiring, increase wages and put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates.  But over the next 10 years, CBO said economic output would be restrained by a relatively slow increase in the U.S. labor supply. ",politicsNews,"August 23, 2016 ",1
"In re-election bid, Ohio senator keeps safe distance from Trump","COLUMBUS, Ohio/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Rob Portman is largely ignoring Donald Trump, which is hard to do in U.S. politics today, but the strategy seems to be working for the Republican senator in his re-election bid in Ohio. As congressional Republicans across the country grapple with the Trump effect on their home-state campaigns, the mild-mannered Portman, 60, may be pointing the way forward in his race, the nations most expensive Senate contest so far this year. Last week in Columbus, the state capital, Portman made no mention of Trump in a campaign appearance, though the New York businessman is the Republican presidential nominee and Portman has endorsed him. On Portmans web site, Trump is absent. Portman has hit the campaign trail in Ohio with a Republican who had White House ambitions, but its the states Governor John Kasich, not Trump. Kasich lost his bid for the partys nomination to Trump. Since then, Kasich pointedly has not endorsed Trump, a property developer and television personality who has never held elected office and whose smash-mouth politics worries many Republicans who fear he may lose them votes in Senate and House of Representatives races. Those concerns have been compounded by Trump falling behind his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in opinion polls. Portman campaign manager Corey Bliss said his boss has never wavered in his support of Trump and there has been no conscious effort to de-couple Portman from the presidential nominee.  But a story on the Cleveland.com web site last week reported that Portman, a veteran Washington insider, has yet to appear at a single Trump campaign event, or even in the same photo, with  him. While effectively disconnecting himself from his partys nominee, Portman has led Democratic rival Ted Strickland by five to nine points in various polls since late July. Strickland is a 75-year-old ex-governor of the Midwestern swing state. A Monmouth University Poll on Monday gave Portman a lead of 48 percent to 40 percent over Strickland, while Clinton had 43 percent of likely Ohio voters and Trump had 39 percent. Portman does not view either presidential nominee as crucial to the Ohio election, Bliss said. We are focused on our race and running for U.S. Senate, he said.  With the Nov. 8 elections nearing rapidly, the Ohio race is the costliest U.S. Senate show-down in 2016. Candidates, parties and outside groups have spent $45 million, said the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog group. Portman worked briefly for former President George H.W. Bush, then was elected to the House. He resigned to be U.S. trade representative in 2005-2006, then director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget for President George W. Bush.  Strickland, a former Ohio governor, previously represented southeastern Ohio in Congress for 12 years. That region of the state could play a role in the Portman-Strickland fight, but Trump himself is a major factor. Paul Beck, a political science professor emeritus at Ohio State University, said despite distancing himself from Trump, Portman could still be hurt if Republicans are so turned off by the presidential nominee that they decide not to vote at all. These are real worries, and its a challenge to Republican candidates all over the country, but particularly to Rob Portman, Beck said. ",politicsNews,"August 23, 2016 ",1
Clinton says U.S. presidential election an 'alternative reality',"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton said on a late-night television show on Monday that sometimes she feels she is in an alternative universe in the U.S. presidential race against Republican Donald Trump. I do feel sometimes like this campaign has entered into an alternative universe, Clinton said on ABCs Jimmy Kimmel Live. I have to step into the alternative reality, answer questions about am I alive, how much longer will I be alive. Clinton was for the first time responding to allegations made by Trump and some of his backers that she is suffering health problems that could be problematic in the White House should she win the Nov. 8 election. Both Clinton and Trump have released notes from doctors declaring them physically fit for the presidency. Kimmel asked Clinton to open a jar of pickles as a test of her strength. She did so successfully. This has become one of their themes. Take my pulse while Im talking to you  make sure Im alive, Clinton said to Kimmel of the health rumors. Clinton said that sometimes Trumps remarks about her  such as a recent charge that President Barack Obama and Clinton co-founded the Islamic State, which he later said was sarcasm  go beyond personal attacks and become harmful to U.S. national security. Theres enough evidence now that when Trump talks the way he talks it actually helps the terrorists, Clinton said. I think its crazy, but I think its also harmful. Clinton said she had begun preparing for the three presidential debates scheduled in September and October. I want to take it seriously, Clinton said. But youve got to be prepared for, like wacky stuff that comes at you and I am drawing on my experience in elementary school. Clinton brushed off the possible release of an additional 14,900 emails that the FBI found when investigating her use of a private email server as secretary of state. My emails are so boring, Clinton said. Whats a few more? The U.S. State Department has already reviewed some 30,068 emails from her 2009-2013 tenure and released most of them, amounting to some 55,000 pages.  ",politicsNews,"August 23, 2016 ",1
Trump calls for special prosecutor to investigate Clinton Foundation,"AKRON, Ohio (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump urged the Justice Department on Monday to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate if donors to the Clinton Foundation got special treatment from the State Department when it was run by his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Trump made the appeal at a rally before thousands of cheering supporters in Akron, Ohio, as he tries to rebound from a slide in national opinion polls with little more than two months to go until the Nov. 8 election. Trump accused former President Bill Clinton and his wife of turning the Clinton Foundation charity into a pay-for-play scheme in which wealthy donors, foreign and domestic, got favors from the State Department during Hillary Clintons 2009-2013 tenure as the countrys top diplomat. Trump faulted both the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation for not indicting Clinton over her use of a private email server as secretary of state. FBI Director James Comey cited her careless handling of classified emails but opted not to prosecutor her. The Justice Department is required to appoint a special prosecutor because it has proved to be, sadly, a political arm of the White House, Trump said. Nobody has ever seen anything like it before. Trumps appeal came the same day a conservative watchdog group, Judicial Watch, released 725 pages of State Department documents, including some it said were examples of preferential treatment provided to donors at the request of former Clinton Foundation executive Douglas Band. Trumps call for an independent investigation followed an announcement by the Clinton Foundation that it would no longer accept foreign donations should Clinton be elected president. The Clinton campaign fired back at Trump, saying the foundation had already laid out the unprecedented steps the charity will take if Hillary Clinton becomes president. Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said in a statement that Trump needs to come clean with voters about his complex network of businesses that are in debt to big banks, including the state-owned Bank of China, after a New York Times report on the subject. Donald Trump should stop hiding behind fake excuses and release his tax returns and immediately disclose the full extent of his business interests, Podesta said. While keeping up the attack on Clinton, Trump in his speech also outlined some agenda items, as Republicans have been urging him to do for months. The more disciplined Trump followed a campaign shake-up last week that brought in veteran pollster Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager. But in a sign that organizational challenges remain, Trump canceled a rally planned for later this week in Las Vegas and postponed an immigration speech in Denver. Earlier on Monday, Trump insisted he was not flip-flopping on immigration, despite a comment by Conway on Sunday that his plan to deport 11 million illegal immigrants was still under review. In his Akron remarks, Trump, struggling to broaden his support beyond the white working-class voters who have been his base of support, again urged blacks and Hispanics to give him a chance, saying: What the hell do you have to lose? repeating a line he delivered on Friday that was criticized by Clinton as ignorant. Trump said Democratic politicians had not been able to stem crime and poverty in inner cities despite pledges to do every election year. I say it and Im going to keep saying it and some people say: Wow that makes sense and some people say: Thats not very nice, Trump said. And I say it with such a deep-felt feeling, what do you have to lose? Well bring jobs back. Well bring spirit back. Well get rid of the crime. ",politicsNews,"August 22, 2016 ",1

"Judge orders State Department to review 14,900 Clinton emails","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A judge ordered the U.S. State Department on Monday to review for possible release 14,900 of Hillary Clintons emails and attachments that the FBI found when investigating her use of a private email server as secretary of state. The judge also scheduled a Sept. 23 hearing on when to release the emails, a deadline that raises the possibility some will become public before the Nov. 8 presidential election between Democrat Clinton and her Republican rival, Donald Trump. Questions about her email practices as secretary of state have dogged Clintons White House run and triggered a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe that found she was extremely careless with sensitive information by using a private server but recommended against bringing charges. State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters it was still reviewing the 14,900 documents and it was unclear how many were personal or work-related. He also said it was unclear how many may duplicate those already released but that there were likely to be quite a few not previously disclosed. The department has already culled through some 30,068 of  Clinton emails from her 2009-2013 tenure as secretary of state and released most of them, amounting to some 55,000 pages. More than 2,000 emails were found to contain classified information. The disclosure of further emails could provide more fodder for opponents who have seized on the issue to argue that Clinton is untrustworthy. Clinton, who leads Trump in opinion polls, has said she did not compromise classified information and used a private server for convenience. She later apologized, saying: I take responsibility. The order by U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg, who is overseeing a group of lawsuits seeking to make Clintons emails public, came the day a conservative watchdog group, Judicial Watch, made public a batch of Clintons emails obtained through a lawsuit.  Judicial Watch said the emails showed donors to the Clinton familys charitable foundation seeking access to her during the period she was secretary of state. Toner said the State Department believed there was no impropriety in foundation officials seeking to meet Clinton, saying any secretary of state or aides get such requests from a wide range of people. The 14,900 documents referred to by Boasberg are believed to include emails not included among those Clinton previously turned over to the State Department after her use of a private email server and private email account became public. This number reflects both non-record (meaning personal) and record materials (meaning work related), said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Some of the emails were found on the servers of people with whom Clinton or her staff was communicating. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell dismissed reports over the weekend that Clinton told federal investigators that it was at his suggestion that she used a personal email account, according to a media report. Powell, who served as the nations top diplomat from 2001 to 2005 under Republican President George W. Bush, told People magazine that while he did send Clinton a memo about his own email practices, Clinton had already chosen to use personal email rather than a government account while she had the job. Her people have been trying to pin it on me. ... The truth is, she was using (the private email server) for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did, Powell told People on Saturday.   The New York Times reported last week that Clinton told federal investigators that Powell had suggested she use personal email for unclassified email when the two spoke over dinner. The conversation occurred in the early months of Clintons tenure at the State Department, the Times said, citing a forthcoming book by journalist Joe Conason that first reported the dinner exchange. Representatives for Powell, in a separate statement to NBC News, said he had no recollection of the conversation with Clinton. He did write former Secretary Clinton an email memo describing his use of his personal AOL email account for unclassified messages and how it vastly improved communications within the State Department, his office told NBC on Friday. The email exchange occurred in 2009, according to the Times. Powell and aides to his successor as secretary of state in the Bush administration, Condoleezza Rice, received some classified information via personal email accounts, Reuters has reported. Clintons additional use of a personal computer server at her home, however, broke State Department rules, an internal watchdog found. ",politicsNews,"August 22, 2016 ",1
U.S. lawmakers press Mylan on EpiPen price increases,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two senior lawmakers on the U.S. Senates Judiciary Committee  on Monday pushed for information regarding sharp price increases for EpiPens, drug-filled injectable devices used by people to counter potentially deadly allergic reactions.  Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch on Monday to ask how Mylan determined the price of EpiPens and what changes had been made to the product to account for the higher price. The top Democrat on the committees antitrust subcommittee, Senator Amy Klobuchar, urged the Federal Trade Commission on Monday to investigate the prices, citing news reports showing that the price of a pack of two EpiPens had gone from $100 in 2008 to $500 this year. Mylan acquired the product in 2007. Although the antitrust laws do not prohibit price gouging, regardless of how unseemly it may be, they do prohibit the use of unreasonable restraints of trade to facilitate or protect a price increase, wrote Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who said her daughter relies on an EpiPen. The FTC should investigate whether Mylan Pharmaceuticals engaged in activity, such as using incentives or exclusionary contracts with insurers, distributors, or pharmacies, to deny an alternative product access to the market. An EpiPen injects a pre-measured dose of epinephrine (adrenaline) that people use if they are having a dangerous allergic reaction. The FTC did not say whether an investigation was under way. The commission takes seriously its obligation to take action where pharmaceutical companies have violated the antitrust laws, a spokesman said. Mylan did not immediately comment on the letters but noted in an email that nearly 80 percent of people with commercial insurance who use a savings card can get the medicine for free. With changes in the healthcare insurance landscape, an increasing number of people and families are enrolled in high deductible health plans, and deductible amounts continue to rise. This shift has presented new challenges for consumers, and they are bearing more of the cost, Mylan also said. The FTC opened a probe into Turing Pharmaceuticals for possible antitrust violations in connection with the companys decision to sharply raise the price of a life-saving drug. Turing had raised the price of Daraprim to $750 a tablet from $13.50. ",politicsNews,"August 22, 2016 ",1
Republicans urge U.S. Treasury to overhaul tax inversion proposals,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers called on U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Monday to overhaul proposed regulations intended to crack down on American companies that try to reduce their U.S. taxes by rebasing abroad in a process known as inversion. In separate letters, top Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee warned on Monday that Treasury is moving too quickly to adopt regulations to prevent overseas mergers known as tax inversions, in which U.S. firms relocate their headquarters in countries with lower corporate tax rates. If the proposed regulations are not completely overhauled, they would damage our economy, increase the barriers to investment for American businesses and innovators, and interfere with the growth of ... good-paying jobs, said a letter to Lew from Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady and other Republicans on the panel.  We cannot allow this to happen, they wrote.  The regulations were proposed in April and Treasury has indicated that it intends to move swiftly to finalize the rules. Industry leaders fear the rules could be in place permanently as early as September. One new inversion rule, which has already been imposed on a temporary basis, was challenged this month in federal court by business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Brady and other Republicans including Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch trained their sights on proposals that industry officials say would swamp business with new red tape and cripple internal cash management operations at companies that are not involved in tax inversions. The only prudent way to move forward  given the complexity of the subject matter, given the many significant substantive concerns that have been pointed out, and given the procedural irregularities  is to issue the regulations in re-proposed form, Hatch said in his letter to Lew.  The proposed debt-equity rule is aimed at stopping a practice known as earnings stripping, which occurs when a newly inverted company eludes U.S. taxes by moving profits overseas as tax-deductible interest payments on loans to its foreign parent. Treasury has proposed requiring debt interest payments to be converted into stock dividends, which are not tax deductible. Critics say the regulations, as proposed, could play havoc with the internal finances of a range of unsuspecting businesses, from multinational corporations to limited partnerships.

Trump campaign signals possible shift on immigration stance,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior aide to U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump signaled a possible shift in his hardline immigration policies on Sunday, saying his plans to deport 11 million people who are in the country illegally were under review. Trump has put his vow to toughen the countrys immigration policies at the center of his campaign. He has promised to carry out mass deportations and build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, proposals that critics have assailed as inhumane and too costly and unrealistic to achieve.  Trailing Democrat Hillary Clinton in opinion polls for the Nov. 8 election and struggling to broaden his support beyond the white working-class voters who have been his base of support, the New York businessman has reached out in recent days to black and Hispanic voters.  On Sunday, his new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told CNN that Trump was committed to a fair and humane approach to those living in the country illegally.   What he supports is to make sure we enforce the law, we are respectful of those Americans who are looking for well-paying jobs and that we are fair and humane to those who live among us in this country, Conway said on State of the Union. Pressed on whether Trumps plans would include a deportation force that the candidate previously pledged to set up, she replied: To be determined. Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, a close ally of Trump, told CBSs Face the Nation that Trump was still working through his plans for deportations should he win the White House.   Hes wrestling with how to do that. People that are here unlawfully, came into the country against our laws, are subject to being removed. Thats just plain fact, the Alabama lawmaker said. Hes thinking that through. Trump has also been rebuked by opponents for his proposal to impose a temporary total and complete shutdown of Muslims seeking to enter the country, later rolled back to focus on countries with a proven history of terrorism.  Clinton has accused Trump of sowing divisiveness and said she would propose a path to citizenship for some migrants living in the United States illegally. The former secretary of state has said that militant groups like Islamic State have begun using Trumps proposed Muslim ban as a recruitment tool.  CAMPAIGN SHAKE-UP Conways comments came after Trump announced last week a major reshuffling of his campaign. Trump promoted Conway, who had been a senior adviser, to the role of campaign manager and hired Stephen Bannon, head of the Breitbart News website, as campaign chief executive. The Trump campaign said on Friday that campaign chairman Paul Manafort was resigning. The campaigns new leadership combines Bannon, a combative conservative, with Conway, a data-driven analyst who has been trying to broaden Trumps appeal to women and independent voters.  Trumps support has slumped in national polls in recent weeks and surveys in pivotal states such as Pennsylvania and New Hampshire have shown a widening lead for Clinton. A Reuters/Ipsos survey released on Friday showed Clinton leading Trump nationally by 8 percentage points, 42 percent to 34 percent. Trump vowed at a campaign rally in Fredericksburg, Virginia, on Saturday to return the Republican Party to the values of President Abraham Lincoln, who issued the Emancipation Proclamation and championed the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution during the U.S. Civil War that led to the abolition of slavery in 1865. Earlier on Saturday, Trump met with a group of Hispanic leaders as part of a new National Hispanic Advisory Council to the campaign. ",politicsNews,"August 21, 2016 ",1
Trump campaign manager Manafort quits after troubled stretch,"(Reuters) - Donald Trumps U.S. presidential campaign sealed a major staff reshuffle with the resignation on Friday of its campaign chairman, and the Republican nominee tried to end weeks of upheaval to focus on beating Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.      The departure of Paul Manafort came as Trump tried this week to reset his unorthodox bid for the White House after falling behind Clinton in opinion polls for the Nov. 8 election. Trump said in a statement he had accepted Manaforts     resignation and praised his great work, but did not offer an explanation for the departure.    Trump aides say the staff changes usher in a greater focus on policy and a more serious tone.  The former reality TV host has stuck to that mission, swapping his free-wheeling rally speeches for prepared remarks that stick to a singular theme. He has concentrated on immigration, trade deals and law and order. Speaking in Dimondale, Michigan, on Friday with the use of a teleprompter, Trump stayed clear of much of the hyperbole that has been a hallmark of his campaign. He attacked Clinton for her position on trade agreements, telling the Michigan crowd that the Democrat would send auto jobs to Mexico.  Nonetheless, he appeared to stray at times from his prepared remarks, as when he said that black voters, who overwhelmingly tell pollsters they prefer Democratic candidates, should vote for him. Youre living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth are unemployed, Trump said. What the hell do you have to lose? Trump, who has never held elected office, did not refer to his staffing changes, but in an interview earlier on Friday his son Eric Trump said unflattering headlines about Manafort had taken a toll. I think my father didnt want to be, you know, distracted by, you know, whatever things that, you know, Paul was dealing with, he told the Fox News Channels Sunday Morning Futures, while also praising Manaforts work for the campaign. Questions have arisen about Manaforts previous work for the political party of the Kremlin-backed former Ukrainian leader, Viktor Yanukovich.  Federal investigators from the U.S. Department of Justice are examining American ties to corruption in Ukraine, CNN reported on Friday. The investigation is looking at the work of Manaforts firm and another lobbying firm, the Podesta Group, headed by Tony Podesta, whose brother, John Podesta, is chairman of Clintons presidential campaign. Clinton leads Trump by 8 percentage points among likely voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Friday. The Aug. 14-18 online poll showed that Clinton was supported by 42 percent of Americans who are expected to vote, compared with 34 percent for Trump. Some 23 percent would not side with either candidate.  On Wednesday, Trump overhauled his campaign team, hiring the head of conservative website Breitbart News, Stephen Bannon, as chief executive of the campaign in a move that bolstered his combative image. Trump also promoted adviser Kellyanne Conway, a data-driven political analyst, to campaign manager. In a previous shake-up, Manafort, who first joined the team in March, took over the running of the campaign from Corey Lewandowski, who was fired as campaign manager in June.     The Clinton campaign has pointed to Manaforts Ukraine work and favorable comments that Trump has made about Russian President Vladimir Putin to sow questions in voters minds about whether the Russian government has an unseen hand in the U.S. election. Russian officials have rejected that accusation. You can get rid of Manafort, but that doesnt end the odd bromance Trump has with Putin, Robby Mook, Clintons campaign manager, said in a statement. John Feehery, a Republican strategist, said it would have been unsustainable for Manafort to stay on after Wednesdays hires. Too many cooks in the kitchen, he said. Trumps hiring of Bannon was seen as a sign he would not hold back in his aggressive, unorthodox campaign manner. Still, Trump offered rare words of regret on Thursday for any time he had caused personal pain with his take-no-prisoners style.  On Friday, he also began airing his first television advertisement since becoming the Republican candidate, buying airtime in the crucial states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida, where Clinton has already spent of millions in television advertising.  The 30-second ad focuses on immigration, saying Clinton would allow terrorists and dangerous criminals into the country, a charge her campaign dismisses. Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute conservative think tank, said Trump still had some time to turn around his campaign, noting the news of the shakeup came as many Americans were enjoying summer vacations.  The final stretch of the protracted campaign traditionally starts after Labor Day, which falls on Sept. 5 this year. Im not sure the public pays a lot of attention to inside campaign stories, she said. But that said, Trump has clearly been having significant problems in the polls and he needed to do something differently and perhaps this is the beginning of the attempt. Clinton won some relief on Friday from a controversy over her use of a private email system when she was secretary of state. A U.S. federal judge ruled that Clinton did not need to give sworn testimony in a lawsuit about the email issue. ",politicsNews,"August 19, 2016 ",1
FBI probes possible U.S. ties to corruption by former Ukraine president: CNN,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI and U.S. Justice Department are investigating possible U.S. ties to alleged corruption involving the former president of Ukraine, including the work of firms headed by political operatives Paul Manafort and Tony Podesta, CNN reported on Friday, citing multiple U.S. law enforcement officials. The broad-based investigation was looking into whether U.S. companies and the financial system were used to enable corruption by the party of former pro-Russian Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, CNN said. A person who answered a telephone number for Manafort said Manafort was not available for comment. The person, who said he was an associate of Manafort and who gave his name only as David, referred queries to a lawyer in Washington, who did not immediately respond to a phone call and an email. In response to a report in the New York Times on Monday, Manafort denied any impropriety in a statement. I have never received a single off-the-books cash payment as falsely reported by The New York Times, nor have I ever done work for the governments of Ukraine or Russia, he said. The New York Times reported that he had received cash payments worth more than $12 million over five years that were itemized on secret ledgers belonging to Yanukovichs Party of Regions. Manafort, who resigned as chairman of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps campaign on Friday, had not been the focus of the probe, CNN said, citing the officials. The probe was looking at the work of other firms linked to the former Ukrainian government, including the Podesta Group, a lobbying and public relations company headed by Tony Podesta, whose brother John Podesta is chairman of the campaign to elect Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Manaforts attorney Richard Hibey did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FBI declined to comment, CNN reported. The Podesta Group has hired an independent legal firm to investigate whether it had been misled by the Centre for a Modern Ukraine, a not-for-profit group linked to the ousted Ukrainian government, a spokeswoman for the group said in a statement. The Justice Department, asked to comment on the report, said it remained committed to helping recover stolen assets on behalf of the people of Ukraine.  Investigators in Ukraine have said Yanukovych and his party engaged in widespread corruption. He fled to Russia following a popular uprising in 2014. ",politicsNews,"August 19, 2016 ",1
"Trump tours flooded Louisiana, Obama to visit next week","BATON ROUGE, La. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump toured flood-battered Louisiana on Friday, shrugging off the Democratic state governors plea for politicians not to stop in areas affected by deadly rains. President Barack Obama said he was also eager for a firsthand look at the damage done by floods that damaged more than 40,000 homes and killed at least 13 people, announcing plans to visit Baton Rouge on Tuesday. Obamas travel requires a massive retinue of Secret Service agents and assistance from local and state law enforcement officials, so the White House usually waits to visit disaster zones to avoid tying up police and emergency resources needed elsewhere.   On Friday, Trumps motorcade drove past piles of possessions and building materials that had been ripped out of flooded homes en route to Greenwell Springs Baptist Church in a hard-hit portion of East Baton Rouge Parish.  Youre going to be fine, Trump told several dozen supporters gathered outside, many asking for autographs and selfies.  The deluge that dumped more than 2-1/2 feet (0.76 meter) on parts of Louisiana has been described as the worst U.S. disaster since Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Trump told reporters he came to help out, joined by vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, in a visit to a state that is typically a Republican stronghold in presidential elections.  Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards office, however, had said Trump did not call to discuss plans. We welcome him to (Louisiana), but not for a photo op, the governors office said in a statement, urging Trump to volunteer or make a sizable donation. Trump told reporters he believed Obama should have cut short a vacation on Marthas Vineyard in New England to visit the area of flood devastation. Trump told reporters he believed Obama should have cut short a vacation on Marthas Vineyard in New England to visit the area of flood devastation. Some Louisianans and others, using the hashtag #wheresobama and #laflood on Twitter, had urged Obama to visit, and Baton Rouge's newspaper, The Advocate, voiced a similar view in an editorial published on Wednesday. (bit.ly/2bDpiiP) Obamas vacation is due to end on Sunday. The White House said the presidents advisers had determined, in consultation with state officials, that Tuesday was an appropriate time to visit. The president is mindful of the impact that his travel has on first responders and wants to ensure that his presence does not interfere with ongoing recovery efforts, the White House said in a statement. Obama planned to visit Baton Rouge, the states capital city, which saw wide flooding. The White House said he would talk to local officials about what more the federal government can do to assist in the recovery. The president has declared much of the state a federal disaster, freeing up emergency resources.  He has been receiving updates from U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate, who both have visited Louisiana. In 2005, then-President George W. Bush, a Republican, drew criticism for flying over extensively damaged New Orleans, Louisiana, and then giving a speech in the still-flooded city following Hurricane Katrina.  Some 86,500 people have already filed for federal aid following the historic levels of rainfall. The state expected 4,000 would still need refuge in shelters on Friday night. Entire neighborhoods must now contend with flood-hit homes. Were talking about an awful lot of people, which is why we are trying to turn on the assistance as soon as possible, Edwards said at a news conference on Friday afternoon, offering details on temporary housing. He spoke earlier in the day with Trumps Democratic rival in the Nov. 8  election, Hillary Clinton, she said on social media.  My heart breaks for Louisiana, and right now, the relief effort cant afford any distractions, she said on Facebook, directing people to support organizations providing assistance.  Yet Kellie Michelli, who lost her home in the flood and was also at the church to pick up food with her family, beamed as she showed off an autograph on a Trump hat from an earlier rally in Baton Rouge. He took time out of his busy schedule to come here, Michelli said. I dont care if he gives a nickel, he showed he cared by coming here. ",politicsNews,"August 19, 2016 ",1
Democrats fear hackers targeted tight Florida races for latest data leaks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leading Democrats are growing increasingly worried that the hackers who made public leaked documents this week were trying  to sabotage the Democratic candidates in several central Florida congressional races, the first time such leaks have been targeted so directly. Two sources familiar with Democratic Party investigations of  recent cyber attacks said documents made public this week by the hacker known as Guccifer2 contained information that could damage Democratic candidates in competitive Florida contests for the U.S. House of Representatives. The documents, hacked from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), which raises funds for the partys House candidates, are detailed dossiers describing the Florida candidates backgrounds, including personal details, as well as political, economic and demographic profiles of the strategic congressional districts. Since 1996, the parties winning the counties in the Interstate 4 corridor between Orlando and Tampa, where several of the targeted districts are located, have won the presidency. Many of the states moderate swing voters live in the I-4 corridor, and if Republican voters there turn out in force, it could cut into the vote for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.The DCCC was one of several Democratic Party organizations, including the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clintons presidential campaign, that have been hacked, but the Democratic Party sources said they did not know who might have helped the hackers select the Florida races to target, or what the hackers were trying to accomplish. There is, though, a growing pattern of attacks on the data systems of U.S. political organizations by hackers whom U.S. intelligence officials and private cyber security firms have concluded are working for or with Russian intelligence agencies.  Donald Trumps presidential campaign has hired consultants CrowdStrike to bolster its data security. But two people familiar with attempts to breach the campaign and other Republican organizations said that so far there was no indication of a penetration as serious as those of the Democratic organizations, and CrowdStrike is not investigating any successful hacking of Trump campaign data.

Clinton need not give sworn testimony over emails: U.S. judge,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic Party presidential candidate Hillary Clinton does not need to give sworn testimony in a lawsuit brought by a conservative watchdog group over her use of an unauthorized private email system while she was U.S. secretary of state, a judge ruled on Friday. Clinton must instead respond in writing within 30 days to questions submitted by Judicial Watch, a group that has long been critical of her conduct and which is suing the Department of State over Clinton-era records. Judge Emmet Sullivans ruling in U.S. District Court in Washington is likely to be a relief to Democrats, who did not welcome the prospect of Clinton having to submit to hours of questioning by lawyers in the middle of her campaign for the Nov. 8 election against Republican Party candidate Donald Trump.  Clinton, who served as the countrys top diplomat from 2009 to 2013, has apologized for her decision to use the unorthodox email set-up, which had the effect of shielding her communications from public-records laws until the arrangement came to light last year. Voters have said in opinion polls that the email server issue contributes to impressions that Clinton is untrustworthy. The U.S. Department of Justice concluded last month there were no grounds to prosecute Clinton for the arrangement following a year-long investigation. Sullivan has allowed Judicial Watch to obtain sworn testimony in sometimes testy exchanges with several Clinton aides in recent months, saying the court needs to establish whether the server was set up to thwart the Freedom of Information Act.  But the judge agreed with Clintons lawyers that former high-ranking government officials can be ordered to give sworn testimony only in exceptional circumstances. Sullivan also allowed Judicial Watch to get sworn testimony from a former State Department official named John Bentel.  According to a scathing report by the State Departments inspector general, Bentel, then a technology official in Clintons office, told junior staffers to never speak of Clintons email server again after they raised concerns. Bentel and his lawyer have declined to comment on the episode. A spokesman for Clinton could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday. Judicial Watch said it was happy with the ruling. We will move quickly to get these answers, Tom Fitton, the groups president, said in a statement. The decision is a reminder that Hillary Clinton is not above the law.

Clinton Foundation health project still mulling foreign donations,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The largest program of the Clinton Foundation, the family philanthropy of U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, is still weighing whether to continue accepting foreign donations should Clinton be elected, a spokeswoman said on Friday. It was reported on Thursday that the Clinton Foundation would no longer receive donations from foreigners or corporations if Clinton wins the election in November, an effort to defuse criticism that donors to the globe-straddling charity might inappropriately seek White House favors in return. But representatives of the charities confirmed on Friday that the new guidelines would only apply to a small portion of the foundations activities, including its work on climate change and some of its work on economic development. The Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), the foundations flagship project credited with reducing the cost of life-saving HIV medicines in the developing world, is yet to decide if it will similarly introduce new limits on donors. CHAI is a separate legal entity from the Clinton Foundation with its own Board, Regan Lachapelle, a CHAI spokeswoman, said in an email. The CHAI Board will be meeting soon to determine its next steps.  CHAI accounts for nearly 60 percent of the $250 million the foundation spent in 2014, according to the foundations most recent annual report posted on its website. CHAI files separate tax returns from the Clinton Foundation, but is included in the foundations audited expenses, annual reports and other promotional literature. Similarly, a Canadian offshoot of the foundation, the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada), or CGEP, will not be bound by the foundations donor limits, but said it will instead become an independent entity if Hillary Clinton becomes president. CGEP, which says Canadian law prevents it from disclosing its donors names without their permission, was founded by Bill Clinton, the former U.S. president, and Canadian businessman Frank Giustra in 2007 to improve work opportunities for people in poor countries.  If Secretary Clinton wins the election, we plan to spin CGEP into an independent entity to continue this important work, Giustra said in a statement. President Clinton and I believe it is important that we continue the work of alleviating poverty around the world. The statement did not specify Bill Clintons future role. A spokesman for Clintons campaign declined to answer questions about the foundation. The charities have received praise from public health experts for their work alleviating the spread of HIV, and Clintons campaign has said any donor expecting political favors in return would be misguided. The family renamed their foundation the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013, although Hillary Clinton stepped down from her board position last year after announcing her presidential bid. Her husband and daughter remain board members. In 2008, Hillary Clinton signed an ethics agreement governing her familys charities in order to become President Barack Obamas secretary of state. She promised that her familys charities would name all their donors on an annual basis and seek clearance from the U.S. State Department before accepting new donations from foreign government money. Last year, the charities said they did not comply with these promises, blaming oversights. On Tuesday, the Boston Globe said in an editorial that the foundation should shut down. Even if theyve done nothing illegal, the foundation will always look too much like a conflict of interest for comfort, the editorial board wrote. ",politicsNews,"August 19, 2016 ",1
Clinton leads Trump by eight points: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton leads Republican rival Donald Trump by 8 percentage points among likely voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Friday. The Aug. 14-18 survey showed 42 percent of Americans supported Clinton ahead of the Nov. 8 general election. That compares with 34 percent support for Trump. Another 23 percent of likely voters would not pick either candidate.  Clinton has led Trump in the poll throughout most of the 2016 campaign, and has maintained her advantage following last months Republican and Democratic conventions. Since late July, support for the former secretary of state has ranged between 41 percent and 44 percent of likely voters, while Trumps support has varied between 33 percent and 39 percent. The race was tighter at this point in the 2012 election, with Democratic President Barack Obama ahead of Republican nominee Mitt Romney by less than 2 percentage points.     Clinton also led a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll that asked people to choose between Clinton, Trump, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party. Some 41 percent supported Clinton and 34 percent supported Trump. Among alternative-party candidates, Johnson came in third with 7 percent and about 2 percent supported Stein.  Clinton and Trump have both struggled to inspire American voters this year. According to the poll, neither candidate is regarded favorably by most Americans, and two-thirds of U.S. adults believe the country is on the wrong track.  Clinton continues to face questions about her handling of classified emails while serving as Obamas secretary of state, while Trumps off-the-cuff remarks about immigrants, women and Muslims have rankled members of his own party. Republican leaders, including former members of Congress, have called for the Republican National Committee to stop helping Trump and refocus its resources on helping candidates win down-ballot races for the House of Representatives and the Senate. Earlier this week, Trump reshuffled his campaign leadership while his campaign chief, Paul Manafort, faced increased scrutiny over his work with pro-Russian political groups in the Ukraine. Manafort resigned on Friday. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It surveyed samples of 1,119 and 1,118 likely voters, respectively, and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"August 19, 2016 ",1
"Trump team talks trade, labor with U.S. farm groups","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Advisers to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump pledged to U.S. agricultural groups that he will give growers and states a say on national farm policy should he be elected, two association leaders said on Friday. Eleven groups representing farmers, seed companies and other players in the sector met for the first time with Trumps top agricultural advisers in Washington on Monday to make recommendations on policy, following a similar meeting with representatives of rival Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in June. The presidential candidates agriculture policies are crucial, agricultural groups say, because net U.S. farm income this year is forecast to drop to its lowest since 2002, largely due to a decline in grain prices. If that happens, incomes will be down 56 percent from a recent high of $123.3 billion in 2013. For Trumps team, the meeting came as he has tried to be more disciplined and on message as he seeks to reset his campaign against Clinton for the Nov. 8 election. He reshuffled top campaign leaders this week, and on Friday accepted the resignation of campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Agricultural trade, labor, crop insurance and food safety were among the topics discussed at the meeting with farm groups, which included Charles Herbster, national chairman of Trumps agricultural advisory committee, and Sam Clovis, Trumps chief policy advisor, participants told Reuters. Former Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman, who is on Trumps advisory committee, also attended, they said. There was an assertion that farmers will be at the tables to make decisions, and that was well received by myself and our colleagues, said Barb Glenn, chief executive officer of the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture.  Also, there was a focus on the concept that the states need to be brought in to work with the federal government, she said. Clintons campaign staff have previously made similar comments to farm groups, said Jay Vroom, chief executive officer of pesticide association CropLife America, who attended meetings with representatives of both candidates. Both of them are quite interested in understanding where American ag is at, he said. Trump on Tuesday named 64 people to his agricultural advisory committee, including six U.S. governors, a former U.S. Department of Agriculture secretary, and the chairmen of the U.S. House and Senate agriculture committees. The latest RealClearPolitics average of national opinion polls puts Clinton 6 percentage points ahead of Trump, at 47.2 percent to 41.7 percent.  ",politicsNews,"August 19, 2016 ",1
Naked Trump statues draw dozens of onlookers in U.S. cities,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - An artists collective took credit for exposing Donald Trump to unflattering scrutiny on Thursday, saying it was responsible for a life-sized nude statue of the Republican presidential candidate that turned up in a New York City park.       Copies of the orange-tinted likeness - featuring a massive belly, small fingers and missing some genital parts - were simultaneously unveiled in downtown Manhattans Union Square Park and public places in four other U.S. cities. The collective titled the work The Emperor Has No Balls. In New York, the unauthorized installation appeared to surprise passers-by - prompting stares, giggles and shrugs of bemusement from park visitors. Ina Cope, a 58-year-old retiree from the Bronx borough of New York, said she was not expecting to see the Trump statue when she got off the subway to meet a friend for lunch. It was crazy: I was coming off the train, minding my own business, and there it was, she said, laughing.  By early afternoon, workers from New Yorks Department of Parks and Recreation had taken down the statue.  Mae Ferguson, a Parks Department spokeswoman, said the statue was removed because the installation of any unapproved structure is illegal in any city park. The activist collective, a group called INDECLINE that includes artists, musicians and filmmakers, claimed ownership of the work, saying in an email that the statues were also placed in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle and Cleveland. It said an artist called Ginger helped create the likeness. These fleeting installations represent this fleeting nightmare and in the fall, it is our wish to look back and laugh at Donald Trumps failed and delusional quest to obtain the presidency, INDECLINE said in a statement. A Trump spokeswoman did not respond immediately to an email with a request for comment. ",politicsNews,"August 18, 2016 ",1
Ukrainian MP offers more details on alleged payments to Trump campaign chief,"KIEV (Reuters) - A Ukrainian lawmaker on Friday divulged more details of what he said were payments made to Donald Trumps campaign chief in the U.S. presidential race by the political party of the Kremlin-backed former Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovich. MP Serhiy Leshchenko said money was allocated for Trump aide Paul Manafort to finance services such as carrying out exit polls at elections, buying computers and conducting research. The largest single payment was $3.5 million.  Manafort has denied allegations - first made in the New York Times on Monday - that he received cash payments worth more than $12 million over five years that were itemized on secret ledgers belonging to Yanukovichs Party of Regions.  Ukrainian anti-corruption investigators have corroborated the existence of what they called a black ledger of payments made by Yanukovichs party but stressed that they could not establish whether Manafort himself received money. Leshchenko, a member of President Petro Poroshenkos parliamentary faction, called on Ukrainian authorities to send a request for assistance to Washington to investigate Manafort.   Manafort didnt work for free in Ukraine, he served the Party of Regions for over 10 years and it is clear that his work was paid, Leshchenko told a news conference. The money was transferred in cash and it is impossible to trace the transactions, but I have no doubt as to the authenticity of these documents, he said.  If Mr Manafort denies any allegations, I think he has to be interrogated into this case and prove his position that he was not involved, Leshchenko added.  Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintons campaign has previously said the allegations were evidence of more troubling connections between Donald Trumps team and pro-Kremlin elements in Ukraine. Trump, a Republican, has spoken favorably in the past of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Last month, he invited Russian hackers to find missing emails from Clintons time as secretary of state, when she used a private email server to conduct government business, although he later described that call as sarcasm. In response to the earlier report in the New York Times, Manafort denied any impropriety in a statement on Monday. I have never received a single off-the-books cash payment as falsely reported by The New York Times, nor have I ever done work for the governments of Ukraine or Russia, he said. Trump overhauled his top political team this week, demoting Manafort, who was brought on as campaign chief in June to professionalize its approach but struggled to get the wealthy businessman to rein in his freewheeling ways.

Trump says he regrets past remarks that 'caused personal pain',"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump apologized on Thursday for past remarks that may have caused personal pain as he sought to refocus his message in the face of falling opinion poll numbers in his first speech since shaking up his campaign team this week. Sometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you dont choose the right words or you say the wrong thing, Trump told a crowd in Charlotte, North Carolina. I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues. Trump did not cite any examples of such remarks. The New York businessman has made his tough talk and brash style a selling point of his campaign for the Nov. 8 election, rarely apologizing in the face of criticism even from within his own party for own party for comments insulting women, Muslims and Mexican immigrants. In his presidential announcement speech last year, he described some Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists. He recently faced a barrage of criticism for belittling the family of a Muslim American soldier who died in Iraq in 2004, after the soldiers father spoke out against Trump at the Democratic National Convention last month. The campaign for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, quickly dismissed Trumps apology, saying: Donald Trump literally started his campaign by insulting people. We learned tonight that his speechwriter and teleprompter knows he has much for which he should apologize, the campaign said in a statement. But that apology tonight is simply a well-written phrase until he tells us which of his many offensive, bullying and divisive comments he regrets  and changes his tune altogether. Trailing Clinton in national opinion polls, Trump has tried to reset his campaign, announcing on Wednesday a shake-up of his senior campaign staff for the second time in less than two months. In the past week, he has abandoned his free-wheeling style of campaigning, instead using a teleprompter at every rally. Trump also began adding non-rally events to his campaign schedule, visiting a police lodge on Thursday afternoon and hosting a roundtable on Wednesday morning. Previously, Trump had eschewed such events that historically comprise a significant portion of a candidates time. Trumps speech on Thursday night, echoing remarks earlier in the week in Wisconsin, reached out to minority voters and accused Clinton of being dishonest. So while sometimes I can be too honest, Hillary Clinton is the exact opposite: She never tells the truth, Trump said. In this journey, I will never lie to you. I will never tell you something I do not believe. Trumps new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, promised on Thursday he would stick to a more disciplined and uplifting message to voters in the final dash to Election Day without crimping his freewheeling style. Conway said the candidates White House bid could preserve his authenticity and still move past a long string of controversies to focus on issues. We would like to take an uplifting, optimistic, policy-centric message directly to the American people, Conway told CBSs This Morning, adding she was confident the former reality television star could stick to a sharper message. Wednesdays campaign reshuffle also brought on Steve Bannon, a combative conservative who headed the Breitbart News website, as chief executive officer, in a move seen as giving Trump a chance to emphasize his unconventional style. Conway said the more disciplined approach by Trump, who has never held elective office, would not mean jettisoning his more off-the-cuff and unpredictable style. Were going to make sure Donald Trump is comfortable about being in his own skin - that he doesnt lose that authenticity that you simply cant buy and a pollster cant give you, she said on CNN. Let him be him, in this sense. Trump has so far been unable to extend his appeal beyond white middle-class voters who pack his rallies. Conway said her rise to campaign manager showed Trump valued a more policy-driven approach that would appeal to women and independent voters. The way to speak to women and all Americans is through issues. Weve got to get away from this content-free campaign and on to the substance, she said. The campaign will put two ads on the air in five states this week, the first campaign ads Trump has aired in the general election, Conway said. He will also continue a series of policy-focused speeches after giving speeches in the past two weeks on jobs, national security and law and order. Hes going to give these policy speeches, she said on CNN. Youll see more of those. Next week is immigration week, followed by education week. ",politicsNews,"August 18, 2016 ",1
Clinton told FBI Colin Powell suggested she use private email: NYT,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told federal investigators that former Secretary of State Colin Powell suggested she use a personal email account, the New York Times reported late on Thursday. Clinton has for over a year been dogged by questions about her use of a private email account while she was the nations top diplomat. The newspaper said the information came from notes the Federal Bureau of Investigation delivered to Congress on Tuesday, which contained details from a more than three hour interview the agency conducted with Clinton over her private email use. The Times also cited an upcoming book that described a dinner conversation where Powell told Clinton to use her own email except for classified information. The newspaper also reported that Clinton asked Powell in a 2009 email exchange about his use of email while serving under former president George W. Bush. Reuters could not independently verify the report. Representatives for Clinton could not be immediately reached late on Thursday. Colin Powells office in a statement said he could not recall the dinner conversation. He did recall describing the system he used to her, but the statement did not say he suggested Clinton do the same.  He did write former Secretary Clinton an email memo describing his use of his personal AOL email account for unclassified messages and how it vastly improved communications within the State Department, the statement said. At the time there was no equivalent system within the department.  He used a secure department computer to manage classified information, the statement said.  Powell has said he had no choice besides using his private account as the department did not have a fully functioning email system of its own when he joined in 2001. Republicans have repeatedly hammered Clinton over the issue, helping to drive opinion poll results showing that many U.S. voters doubt her trustworthiness. FBI Director James Comey announced last month that no criminal charges would be filed over Clintons use of private email servers while secretary of state, but rebuked her for extremely careless handling of classified information.

"Clinton Foundation to bar foreign, corporate funding if Hillary Clinton elected president","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Clinton Foundation will stop accepting foreign and corporate donations if Hillary Clinton is elected president and will stop holding the annual Clinton Global Initiative meetings whatever the outcome of the November election, a foundation spokesman said on Thursday. Former President Bill Clinton told staff members on Thursday he would resign from the foundations board and that it would only accept donations from U.S. citizens and independent charities. The former president also said he would hold the 12th and final Clinton Global Initiative in September. The annual meetings have included current and former heads of state, corporate leaders and celebrities who discussed poverty, healthcare, development and other issues.     Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian confirmed the moves, which were first reported by the Associated Press. The foundation has come under fire during Hillary Clintons Democratic presidential campaign, with Republicans charging that donors were rewarded with access to her and her aides as well as her husband while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.  Other critics have said the foundations reliance on millions of dollars from foreign governments created conflicts of interest for a would-be U.S. president. Clinton resigned from the foundations board after launching her successful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. She will face Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election.  The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, founded in 2001, has raised more than $2 billion for causes that focus on health and environmental issues, mainly in the developing world.

"Hackers targeted Trump campaign, Republican Party groups: sources","(Reuters) - Hackers targeted the computer systems of presidential candidate Donald Trump and Republican Party organizations as well as Democratic Party networks, sources familiar with investigations into the attacks said. At least one Trump staff members email account was infected with malware in 2015 and sent malicious emails to colleagues, according to one insider for the Republican candidates campaign and an outside security expert. It was unclear whether or not the hackers actually gained access to campaign computers. In the past month, U.S. security officials have said that starting last year, hackers infiltrated computers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton and her partys congressional fundraising committee. U.S. officials said they have concluded that Russia or its proxies were responsible, leading to calls by some Democrats and cyber security officials for the Obama administration to blame Russia publicly. Kremlin officials have dismissed the allegations as absurd, but there is anxiety in Washington over the possibility that a foreign power might be using hacked information to meddle in the Nov. 8 U.S. election. The Trump campaign has hired security firm CrowdStrike, which also is assisting the Democratic National Committee, according to one person briefed on the matter. The company declined to comment.A different outside security firm was hired to examine software the Trump and Clinton campaigns use to manage mailings, electronic outreach and other campaign efforts, another person who was briefed on the issue said.A spokeswoman for Trumps campaign declined to comment. A spokesman for the Republican National Committee could not immediately be reached for comment. The tools and techniques used to hack Republican targets resemble those employed in attacks on Democratic Party organizations, including the DNC and Clintons campaign organization, two sources said. That has led U.S. officials to reach a preliminary assessment that Russias military and civilian intelligence agencies or their proxies have targeted both political parties. Attempts to hack into Republican political organizations over an extended period were reported in intelligence bulletins circulated by U.S. agencies, four sources said. They did not disclose the identities of the organizations. Two U.S. security officials said the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have offered assistance to both political parties in identifying possible intrusions and upgrading their defenses against what one of the officials called constantly evolving threats.

U.S. State Department finds briefing video cut but unclear why,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. State Department video of a press briefing about secret U.S.-Iran nuclear talks was deliberately edited but there is no evidence to suggest the cut was intended to hide information, a U.S. spokesman said on Thursday after further details were released of an investigation into the incident. We are confident the video of that press briefing was deliberately edited, State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters, adding: What we were not able to determine is why the edit was made in the first place. Theres no evidence to suggest it was made with the intent to conceal information from the public. The excised portion of a Dec. 2, 2013, briefing included a question about whether an earlier spokeswoman for the department had misled reporters about whether the United States was holding secret direct nuclear talks with Iran. The State Department initially said it was caused by a glitch but later said it was a deliberate omission. Kirby said the investigation by the departments Office of the Legal Adviser could not rule out that a technical glitch might have deleted the portion of the video because of the choppy nature of the cut. He said the findings had now been shared with Secretary of State John Kerry and with congressional members. ",politicsNews,"August 18, 2016 ",1
U.S. says payment to Iran used as leverage for prisoners' release,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Thursday it released $400 million in cash to Iran under a tribunal settlement only once it was assured that American prisoners had been freed and had boarded a plane. The payment of the $400 million was not done until after the prisoners were released, State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters. We took advantage of that to make sure we had the maximum leverage possible to get our people out and get them out safely, Kirby added. It was the first time the administration has said publicly that it used the payment as leverage to ensure the prisoners were released by Iran. Three of the five prisoners, including Jason Rezaian, the Washington Postss Tehran bureau chief; Saeed Abedini, a pastor from Idaho and Amir Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine from Flint, Michigan, as well as some family members, were part of a prisoner exchange that followed the lifting of most international sanctions against Iran following a nuclear deal in 2015. One more prisoner, Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari, chose to remain in Iran, while a fifth prisoner, American student Matthew Trevithick, was released separately.    Both U.S. President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have denied that the payment was ransom for the release of the prisoners or tied to the Iran nuclear deal. The White House announced on Jan. 17 it was releasing $400 million in funds frozen since 1981, plus $1.3 billion in interest owed to Iran, as part of a settlement of a long-standing Iranian claim at the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in The Hague. The funds were part of a trust fund Iran used before its 1979 Islamic Revolution to buy U.S. military equipment that was tied up for decades in litigation at the tribunal. The payment was made by the United States in cash due to international sanctions against Iran. The administration has maintained that negotiations over the funds and the prisoners were conducted on separate tracks and were in no way linked. Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has asked Kerry to appear at a future committee hearing to discuss the payment.

Pennsylvania governor nominates replacement for convicted attorney general,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf on Thursday nominated the states inspector general to serve as interim attorney general until Novembers election, temporarily replacing Kathleen Kane, who resigned the post earlier this week after her conviction for perjury. Bruce Beemer, who previously served under Kane as first deputy in the attorney generals office, will have to be confirmed by the state Senate. Wolf said in a statement that he had already conferred with both Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate and expected a quick confirmation. Beemer would hold the job until a successor is elected in November for a four-year term, and then return to his role as inspector general. Kane announced her resignation on Tuesday, a day after a jury convicted her of leaking sealed grand jury material to a news reporter in an effort to embarrass a political rival. The move will likely end a brief stint as acting attorney general for Bruce Castor, whom Kane had hired as her second-in-command earlier this year. In a statement, Castor said the governor was fulfilling his duties under the law. I will do all within my power to see that the office of attorney general is in the best possible shape for whenever the next attorney general arrives, Castor said. Castor, the former Montgomery County district attorney, made headlines earlier this year when he testified at a hearing for comedian Bill Cosby in his sexual assault case. Castor said he had agreed not to prosecute Cosby if the entertainer testified in a civil case brought by his accuser. But a court ruled Castors claims were not enough to prevent the current district attorney from bringing charges. Kanes conviction, meanwhile, ended what had once been seen as a promising political career. Prosecutors said Kane believed former state prosecutor Frank Fina was behind a 2014 newspaper article that said she had abandoned a corruption investigation into Philadelphia officials. In an effort to take revenge, prosecutors said, Kane leaked sealed details about a separate investigation that Fina declined to pursue and then lied about having done so to a grand jury investigating the matter. Kane had portrayed the charges as politically motivated, after she revealed lewd emails exchanged among judges, state officials and prosecutors that she discovered while re-examining the Jerry Sandusky molestation investigation. Several officials, including two state Supreme Court justices, lost their jobs in the wake of the email scandal, dubbed Porngate. ",politicsNews,"August 18, 2016 ",1
Clinton Foundation hired cyber firm after suspected hacking: sources," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bill and Hillary Clintons charitable foundation hired the security firm FireEye to examine its data systems after seeing indications they might have been hacked, according to two sources familiar with the matter.  So far, no message or document hacked from the New York-based Clinton Foundation has surfaced in public, the sources said.  One of the sources and two U.S. security officials said that like hackers who targeted the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clintons presidential campaign and the Democrats congressional fundraising committee, the hackers appear to have used spear phishing techniques to gain access to the foundations network.  ELSEWHERE IN THE NEWS U.S. swimmers trying to return from Rio yanked off flight A desperate country crushes 2,000 guns in public, plans bullet registry These techniques include creating bogus emails or websites in an effort to gain access to Clinton Foundation staffers emails and then to the foundation itself.  Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the U.S. officials said the hackers used the same techniques Russian intelligence agencies or their proxies employed against the Democratic Party groups, which suggests that Russians also attacked the foundation.  Kremlin officials dismissed as absurd the allegations of Moscows involvement, which were made last month amid political party nominating conventions for the Nov. 8 election.  Neither former White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, the Clinton Foundations principal lawyer, nor a spokeswoman for the foundation responded to requests for comment on the hacking and the precautions the organization has taken.  Officials with FireEye said the company could not discuss its clients.  Although no documents have emerged, the attacks have left some Democrats and Clinton campaign officials worried that the hackers might have obtained emails and voice messages that could be used to reinforce Republican charges that donors to the Clinton Foundation were rewarded with access to Clinton and her aides while she was secretary of state or to her husband, former President Bill Clinton.  Another concern: hackers or outlets such as the anti-secrecy WikiLeaks website could release documents and emails damaging to her presidential campaign, several people familiar with the foundations activities said.  The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee convened a closed-door meeting on Wednesday to discuss best cyber security practices.  The meeting, according to people familiar with it, included a recommendation that staff and lawmakers change their phone numbers and email addresses if that information was published online by hackers believed to be working for or with Russian intelligence agencies.  One of the U.S. officials said, however, that the spear phishing pattern used against several organizations, appears to reinforce the intelligence communitys preliminary assessment that the attacks were intended more for espionage than for trying to influence the U.S. presidential election.  So far, said a third U.S. official familiar with the attacks, there is no evidence that the hackers were able to follow any of the hacked emails into the State Departments classified email systems.  Anxiety in Washington over the possibility that a foreign power might be using hacked information to meddle in the U.S. election has prompted some Democrats and cyber security experts to urge the Obama administration to blame Russia publicly.  Rep. Jim Himes, a Democrat on the House of Representatives intelligence committee, said the United States should carry a big stick in cyber security matters. The U.S. government needs to be very clear, very direct, and hold these people accountable.  Current and former White House and intelligence officials said the Obama administration is unlikely to blame Russia publicly, given the difficulty of attributing the attacks without revealing American sources and methods, the geopolitical concerns at play, and a fear that doing so could risk aggravating cyber conflict.

Trump hires 'street fighter' in new shakeup of White House campaign,"(Reuters) - U.S. Republican Donald Trump overhauled his presidential campaign team on Wednesday for the second time in less than two months, hiring the head of a conservative news website to bolster his combative image and try to reverse poor opinion poll numbers. Trump named Steve Bannon, head of the Breitbart News website, as campaign chief executive officer, a new position. He also promoted senior adviser Kellyanne Conway to the post of campaign manager.  The latest shake-up combines Bannon, a conservative flamethrower, with Conway, a measured, data-driven analyst who might be able to broaden Trumps appeal to women and independent voters.     It offers Trumps team a chance to return to the let Trump be Trump style practiced by former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski that helped Trump, who has never held elective office, win the Republican presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election.     Lewandowski, ousted in the last campaign reorganization in June, said on CNN that Bannon was a street fighter like himself. A Trump campaign statement announcing the changes touted a Bloomberg Politics article that branded Bannon the most dangerous political operative in America.  Whether that style will work in the fight against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is unclear. Trump, a New York real estate developer and former reality TV host, has largely been unable to extend his reach beyond white middle-class voters who pack his rallies. Trump trails Clinton in national opinion polls and in many battleground states, potentially facing a big defeat that could also cost Republicans congressional races.         Trump, who relishes revving up crowds with off-the-cuff remarks, drew criticism for comments insulting women, Muslims and Mexican immigrants during the primary campaign for the Republican nomination.  He has since faced a barrage of criticism from Republicans over his campaign style and his refusal to stick to a policy message. In particular, he has been rebuked for his prolonged feud with the family of a Muslim U.S. Army captain who was killed in the Iraq war.  On Wednesday afternoon, Trump received his first intelligence briefing from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Retired U.S. Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, a Trump adviser who attended the briefing at the New York field office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said the officials who conducted the two-hour session were absolutely professional and that it was a great conversation. Intelligence officials brief the major-party U.S. presidential candidates on foreign policy and national security issues but do not disclose ultra-sensitive information about ongoing U.S. undercover operations, methods or the identities of intelligence sources. Wednesdays campaign appointments amounted to a demotion for Paul Manafort, who was brought on as campaign manager in June to bring a more professional touch to Trumps campaign but has struggled to get the businessman to rein in his freewheeling ways.     Clinton, a former secretary of state who has called Trump temperamentally unsuited for the White House, said staff shake-ups did nothing to change the candidate and his rhetoric. Donald Trump has shown us who he is, he can hire and fire anybody he wants from his campaign, they can make him read new words from a teleprompter, but he is still the same man who insults Gold Star families, demeans women, mocks people with disabilities and thinks he knows more about ISIS than our generals, she told a rally in Ohio. Conway and Bannon may prove to be opposing forces in Trumps campaign. Conway is analytical and numbers-driven and often offers a more pragmatic approach to winning campaigns. She is expected to travel with Trump. Bannon likes to push the limits of polite conversation and revels in taking the fight up a notch, strategists say. For Steve and I, we also recognize that we are different when we say we have different styles, but we have one vision, Conway told reporters.  Bannon was a key figure in producing and promoting a movie called Clinton Cash that accused Bill and Hillary Clinton of doing favors for high-dollar donors to the Clinton Foundation charity, a theme that Trump has been touching on in his campaign speeches. My guess is Bannon will be a bull in a china shop and Conway will be focused on messaging and paid media, said Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak. The appointment of Bannon suggested Trump was aiming not to tone down his aggressive style but to be more disciplined in emphasizing themes that resonate strongly with the voters he is trying to court, such as his tough stance against illegal immigration and withering personal criticism of Clinton. I am who I am, I dont want to change, Trump told Wisconsin television station WKTB on Tuesday. If you start pivoting, youre not being honest with people. The shift to new leadership may not be a good sign at this stage of a campaign, but some Republican strategists said it was not too late for Trump. Ive thought for a while that theyve needed more smart, senior people and it looks like they just got them, said Republican strategist Charlie Black. Its only the middle of August. This race is going to be close in the end, but he does need to tighten up his performance. Conway told Fox News she was advising Trump to take his case directly to the people. With Donald Trump, he is still his own best messenger because people see him as very authentic.. She has worked to improve the Republican Partys standing with women voters and to push back on Democratic accusations that Republicans are waging a war on women.  Manafort drew unwelcome attention this week when The New York Times reported his name was on secret ledgers showing cash payments designated to him of more than $12 million from a Ukrainian political party with close ties to Russia. Manafort denied any impropriety on Monday. The current RealClearPolitics average of national opinion polls puts Clinton six percentage points ahead of Trump, at 47.2 percent to his 41.2 percent.

FBI documents viewed in secure areas of the U.S. Capitol,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI documents about the agencys investigation into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state were being reviewed on Wednesday in secure rooms of the U.S. Capitol. Lawmakers and select staff from some congressional committees could page through the material, parts of which are redacted, in large binders labeled secret that the Federal Bureau of Investigation turned over to Congress on Tuesday. Republican lawmakers requested the information last month after the FBI recommended no criminal charges against Clinton. Last I heard, my colleagues had their turn with the documents at 1:30 p.m., said a Senate Judiciary committee aide. Theres only one set of documents for all the interested Senate committees, as I understand it. She said those viewing the material were allowed to take notes. But if notes were taken on the classified parts, those notes had to be left in the secure area with the documents.  Clinton has been dogged for more than a year by questions about her use of a private email account while she was the nations top diplomat from 2009 to 2013. Republicans have repeatedly hammered Clinton over the issue, helping to drive opinion poll results showing that many U.S. voters doubt her trustworthiness. She faces Republican nominee Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election. The FBI said on Tuesday it had provided relevant materials to congressional committees looking into the matter. The material contains classified and other sensitive information and is being provided with the expectation it will not be disseminated or disclosed without FBI concurrence, the agency said in a statement. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican, said in a statement on Tuesday an initial review of the material showed most of it was marked unclassified. Grassley, who has called for unclassified parts of the documents to be made public, wrote on Wednesday to the Senate Security Office, which has custody of the documents, asking them to provide his committee with an unclassified version. Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon in a statement also called for the public release of the documents, rather than allow Republicans to mischaracterize them through selective, partisan leaks. The documents on the Senate side of the Capitol are under the control of the Office of Senate Security, Senate aides said. In the House of Representatives, another set was being viewed in a Secure Compartmented Information Facility, an aide with the House Oversight and Government Reform committee said. Our investigators with (security) clearances have gone down there and looked at the documents, the Oversight committee aide said.  It was unclear how many lawmakers had actually seen the material so far. Most members of Congress were not in town because of a congressional recess. The documents were made available to the Judiciary, Homeland Security, and Appropriations committees in the Senate, and the Oversight, Judiciary and Appropriations committees in the House, aides said.   The Intelligence committees on both sides of the Capitol also have copies, so they do not have to join the line with the others. ",politicsNews,"August 17, 2016 ",1
U.S. senator expresses concern about ag tech mergers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two major mergers in agricultural technology and seeds could hurt competition in the industry and make it harder for smaller companies to compete, Senator Charles Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote in a letter on Wednesday sent to antitrust enforcers. Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, urged the Federal Trade Commission, which is reviewing the purchase of Syngenta AG by the China National Chemical Corp [CNNCC.UL], and the Justice Department, which is looking at the merger of Dow Chemical Co and DuPont Co, to coordinate on the two reviews. It is important that these transactions not be reviewed in isolation, wrote Grassley.I urge the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to collaborate, as appropriate, with input from the Department of Agriculture, in their analysis of the agricultural biotechnology and seed industry and the impact of these proposed transactions. Dow and DuPont said in December that they would combine in an all-stock merger with plans to then break into three separate businesses. In February, Chinas state-owned ChemChina [CNNCC.UL] made a $43 billion bid for Swiss seeds and pesticides group Syngenta. The deals by some of farmers biggest global suppliers concerned Grassley, who represents a largely agricultural state. I am concerned that the convergence of these proposed transactions  as well as others currently being discussed  will have an enhanced adverse impact on competition in the industry and raise barriers to entry for smaller companies, he wrote. I also am concerned that further concentration in the industry will impact the price and choice of chemicals and seed for farmers, which ultimately will impact choice and costs for consumers. Finally, I am concerned that further consolidation will diminish critical research and development initiatives, added Grassley.  The letter was dated Tuesday and sent to FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez and Renata Hesse, the acting head of the Justice Departments Antitrust Division. ",politicsNews,"August 17, 2016 ",1

Trump campaign chairman helped pro-Russians in Ukraine move money to U.S. firms: AP,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, helped a Ukrainian political party with close ties to Russia secretly move at least $2.2 million to two major Washington lobbying firms, the Associated Press reported on Wednesday. The AP, citing sources with direct knowledge of the effort, said the transfers were set up in ways to obscure the Ukrainian partys attempts to sway U.S. policies, using a nonprofit organization to distance funds from Ukrainian politicians. U.S. law requires American lobbyists to register and report in detail any ties to foreign political parties or leaders to the U.S. Justice Department. The heads of both firms - Podesta Group Inc and Mercury LLC - told the AP they had concluded their work did not merit disclosure to the department, according to the report. Representatives for Trump and Mercury did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Podesta Group Chief Executive Officer Kimberley Fritts said its lawyers worked with those at Mercury to determine that registering under the Foreign Agent Registration Act was unnecessary. It also obtained a statement from the nonprofit in question saying it was not directly or indirectly involved with a foreign entity, she said in an emailed statement.  The Podesta Group was founded in 1987 by Tony Podesta and his brother John, who now is campaign chairman for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. John Podesta has not been with the firm for several years, but his brother is its chairman. The AP report comes less than three months before the Nov. 8 election and as polls show Trump slipping behind Clinton. Trumps campaign on Wednesday announced a staff shake-up replacing Manafort as campaign manager after just two months. He will remain chairman and chief strategist. The New York Times this week reported Manaforts name was found on secret ledgers showing cash payments designated to him of more than $12 million from a Ukrainian party with Russian ties. Manafort has denied any impropriety.  Ukrainian officials confirmed Manaforts name appeared on a ledger and that more than $12 million had been allocated as an expenditure but said the presence of his name did not mean he received the funds. Clintons campaign has said Manaforts associations are a troubling sign of ties between Trumps campaign team and pro-Kremlin elements in Ukraine. According to the AP, in 2012 Manafort and associate Rick Gates worked on behalf of Ukraines then-president, Viktor Yanukovych, and helped steer the efforts of European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, an advocacy group that once included members of Yanukovychs party.  The group paid at least $2.2 million to the Washington firms to push positions favorable to the party from 2012 until 2014, when Yanukovych was ousted and fled to Russia, the AP said, citing sources. That work included efforts to counter a potential congressional resolution pressuring Yanukovych to release a political rival from prison, the AP reported. Gates, who also works for the Trump campaign, told the AP his actions were lawful. He said he and Manafort had introduced the advocacy group to the firms and sometimes consulted with the firms on Ukrainian politics, the report said. Podestas Fritts said her firm was unaware that Gates was a consultant to the Ukrainian party when he introduced the advocacy group: Our assumption was that he was working for the Centre, as we were hired to do.

FBI delivers documents on Clinton email probe to U.S. Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Tuesday it had turned over to the U.S. Congress a number of documents related to its probe into Hillary Clintons use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. The Democratic presidential nominee has for over a year been dogged by questions about her use of a private email account while she was the nations top diplomat. Republicans have repeatedly hammered Clinton over the issue, helping to drive opinion poll results showing that many U.S. voters doubt her trustworthiness. The FBI said it had provided relevant materials to congressional committees looking into the matter. The material contains classified and other sensitive information and is being provided with the expectation it will not be disseminated or disclosed without FBI concurrence, the agency said in a statement. The Clinton campaign criticized the delivery of the documents. This is an extraordinarily rare step that was sought solely by Republicans for the purposes of further second-guessing the career professionals at the FBI, Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement.  We believe that if these materials are going to be shared outside the Justice Department, they should be released widely so that the public can see them for themselves, rather than allow Republicans to mischaracterize them through selective, partisan leaks. A spokeswoman for the House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee said in an email that staff for the panel was reviewing the information classified as secret. There are no further details at this time, the aide said. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican, said in a statement that an initial review of the material showed most of it was marked unclassified, and urged the FBI to make as much of it public as possible. FBI Director James Comey told Congress last month that Clintons handling of classified information while using  private email servers was extremely careless. But he said he would not recommend criminal charges be brought against her. Comeys statement lifted a cloud of uncertainty from Clintons White House campaign. But his strong criticism of her judgment ignited a new attack on her by Republicans, including Donald Trump, her Republican opponent in the Nov. 8 election. The Oversight committee, chaired by Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz, had asked the FBI for the complete investigative file from its review of Clintons use of a private email server. The FBI has also provided documents from its investigation to the House Judiciary Committee, an aide said. Chaffetz and Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, also a Republican, last month urged federal prosecutors to investigate whether Clinton had committed perjury. They said some FBI findings about her email servers were at odds with her previous testimony to Congress about the matter, for example, her statement she had not sent or received information designated as classified. But the FBI, in a letter sent to the committee on Tuesday, said the fact that the agency had uncovered three instances in which Clinton had received emails containing (C) markings, which denote confidential information, was not clear evidence of knowledge or intent to mishandle such material. The letter, which accompanied the FBIs investigative documents, noted relevant emails had been forwarded to Clinton by staff, lacked header and footer markings indicating the presence of classified information, and only one email was later determined by the State Department to contain classified information. Clintons fellow Democrats were scornful that Republicans were refusing to let the matter drop. The FBI already determined unanimously that there is insufficient evidence of criminal wrongdoing, said Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the Oversight committee. Republicans are now investigating the investigator in a desperate attempt to resuscitate this issue, keep it in the headlines, and distract from Donald Trumps sagging poll numbers.

"Clinton names close confidants, Obama veterans to transition team","WASHINGTON/PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Hillary Clintons White House transition team, a mix of former advisers of President Barack Obama, close confidants, long-time colleagues and former elected officials, reflects the sense of careful organization the Democratic candidate has aimed to project in her presidential campaign. But her Republican rival, Donald Trump, could seize on the group to make the point that she is part of the establishment he aims to defeat in Novembers election, and to reiterate his charge that a Clinton administration would be an Obama third term. The group, which the Clinton campaign named on Tuesday and which will lay the groundwork for her to take charge quickly if she wins, is evidence of Clintons long experience in Washington as a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady. Transition teams aim to help the president-elect make key decisions during the period between the election and the inauguration, in this case from Nov. 8 to Jan. 20, so the new White House occupant can fill leadership posts quickly. They are the names you would expect  people who have been advising her for a long time; people who have worked with her for a long time and people who are peers, who she respects, Matt Bennett of the moderate Democratic group Third Way said of Clintons transition team.  The group will be headed by Ken Salazar, a former interior secretary and U.S. senator. He will lead four co-chairs: former Obama national security adviser Tom Donilon; former Obama aide Neera Tanden, who now leads the progressive think tank the Center for American Progress; former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm and Maggie Williams, the director of Harvards Institute of Politics. Heather Boushey, the executive director of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, will be the chief economist. Two additional policy advisers from Clintons campaign, Ed Meier and Ann OLeary, will also move full-time to the transition team, the campaign said in a statement. The transition team does not necessarily reflect future policy. The job here is to give options, not just say there is one policy course you want to take, said Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, who advised the presidential campaigns of Al Gore and John Kerry. Clinton would be the first woman elected to the U.S. presidency and Shrum said Clintons team has got to be the first transition team in history where the majority of its members are women. Shrum added that Clinton is largely following Obamas template as he prepared for his transition after the 2008 election. Tanden, who played a key role in shaping Obamas health care overhaul, is a member of Clintons tight-knit inner circle, and has also worked for her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Williams was the 1992 transition director for Clinton when she became first lady, and then her chief of staff in the White House. Clinton worked closely with Donilon when she led the State Department from 2009-2013. Granholm, the former governor, is also a former state attorney general and has years of experience in Democratic politics. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee applauded the selection of OLeary and Boushey, praising their economic positions. The environmental group Greenpeace criticized Salazar for not curbing fracking in his home state of Colorado. The announcement of the team came as Clinton has gained momentum in the opinion polls, with the current RealClearPolitics average of national polls showing her 6.7 points ahead, at 47.7 percent to Trumps 41 percent.  Trumps campaign has struggled after he made a string of controversial remarks since formally winning his partys nomination last month. More establishment Republicans, alarmed by Trumps inability or unwillingness to rein in his provocative remarks, have distanced themselves from the candidate in recent weeks. The Wall Street Journal, a leading conservative voice, said in an editorial on Monday that he should fix his campaign in the next three weeks or hand over to his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Trump, a New York businessman who has never held elected office, picked New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to head his transition team in May. ",politicsNews,"August 16, 2016 ",1
Liz Cheney claims victory in Wyoming primary for U.S. House seat,"CODY, Wyo. (Reuters) - Liz Cheney, former Vice President Dick Cheneys eldestdaughter, claimed victory late on Tuesday in Wyomings Republican primary race for the states lone U.S. House of Representatives seat. Unofficial early results by 10 p.m. (0400 GMT) showed Cheney with 26,363 votes in the nations least populous state. State Senator LelandChristensen was running a distant second, with almost 15,000 votes, while her six other Republican competitors each held fewer than 12,000 votes. Im honored by the trust Wyoming Republicans have placed in me to serve as our next Representative in Congress, Cheney said in a statement. The Casper Star-Tribune newspaper called the race late on Tuesday night. Wyoming is a reliably red state, with the Republican primary winner all but assured of a general election victory in November. Cheneys apparent victory comes two years after she launched an unsuccessful bid for a U.S. Senate seat that saw her withdraw from the race early. She drew criticism from some establishment Republicans two years ago when she ran against popular incumbent Senator Mike Enzi and was labeled a carpetbagger for having onlyrecently established residency in Teton County, one of the countrys wealthiest zip codes, in a state widely populated by working-class miners, oil, and gas workers. She said a family health crisis prompted her to withdraw. Cheney, 49, is a lawyer who worked in the U.S. State Department while her father was vice president. Her campaign has received strong financial support from former high-ranking government officials, such as former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, formerDefense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and former White House political adviser Karl Rove. Cheney campaigned as a strong conservative voice for Wyoming, promising to protect the states pivotal coal industry, defend gun rights, and generally work to reverse PresidentObamas devastating policies.

Trump says he would bar top aides from accepting speaking fees,"WEST BEND, Wis. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said if elected he would force top administration officials to sign a pledge not to accept speaking fees from corporations with registered lobbyists or foreign countries for five years after leaving office.  The pledge - a rare policy pronouncement from the New York real estate mogul - was part of his criticism of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton who, along with her husband, former president Bill Clinton, have accepted millions of dollars in speaking fees since he left office.

Clinton leads Trump by six points in latest Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has a 6-percentage-point lead over Republican rival Donald Trump, according to a Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll released on Tuesday. Clintons support has ranged from 41 percent to 44 percent since late July, and was about 41 percent in the Aug. 11-15 online poll. Trumps support has experienced wider shifts ranging from 33 percent to 39 percent while his campaign has endured controversies and distractions in recent weeks. He is favored by about 35 percent of likely voters, according to the most recent poll. Trump has caused divisions in the Republican Party with his strong anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric, and faced criticism from both parties earlier this month for a days-long feud with the parents of a Muslim American Army captain killed in Iraq. Last week, 70 Republicans, including former members of Congress and Republican National Committee staff, wrote a letter calling for the RNC to stop helping Trump, whose actions they said were divisive and dangerous. The number of likely voters who picked neither Clinton nor Trump in the poll was nearly 24 percent.  At this point in 2012, President Barack Obama was ahead of Republican nominee Mitt Romney by nearly the same margin, favored by 46 percent of likely voters to Romneys 41 percent, with about 13 percent picking neither candidate. Obama and Romney swapped the lead in the poll several times through the summer and early fall before the president took and held the lead in late October. In a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll that gave respondents the option to choose from Clinton, Trump, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Clinton also led Trump by 6 percentage points. Of the alternative party candidates, Johnson came in third with 8 percentage points. Stein had about 2 percentage points.  The Aug. 11-15 polls surveyed a sample of 1,132 and 1,131 likely voters, respectively, and had a credibility interval of 3 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"August 16, 2016 ",1
"Trump, in law and order speech, calls for African-American support","WEST BEND, WIS. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Tuesday delivered his most aggressive call yet to woo African-American voters, vowing to restore law and order, only days after a fatal police shooting of a black man sparked more street violence. Speaking a few miles from Milwaukee, which was rocked by weekend riots, Trump accused his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton of bigotry and vowed to protect the jobs of minorities from immigrants. Trump has been repeatedly called a bigot by his Democratic opponents. Im asking for the vote for every African-American citizen struggling in our society today who wants a different and much better future, Trump said. Jobs, safety, opportunity, fair and equal representation: We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to, and talks down to, communities of color and sees them only as votes  thats all they care about  not as individual human beings worthy of a better future. Earlier, Trump held three events in Milwaukee, a city still reeling from violent protests after the death of Sylville Smith, 23. Authorities said Smith was stopped for acting suspiciously and was shot by police because he was carrying an illegal handgun and refused orders to drop it.  Trump encountered only a handful of peaceful protesters while in the city, including some at a closed fundraiser. He held a brief meeting with veterans and law enforcement, including Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke and Inspector Edward Bailey. But news media representatives were escorted out and not permitted to hear the discussions.  Clarke, who is black and spoke at last months Republican National Convention, has criticized the protests, writing in an opinion piece for The Hill that they were a collapse of the social order, where tribal behavior leads to reacting to circumstances instead of waiting for facts to emerge. Trump also taped a town hall meeting with Fox News, in which he blamed President Barack Obama for what he sees as hostility toward police. He has not been good to the police, simply, and the police are not big fans of his, Trump said. Trump traveled 45 minutes outside of Milwaukee, which is 40 percent black, to deliver his appeal to African-American voters in the suburb of West Bend, Wisconsin, a community that is 95 percent white. He spoke before an almost entirely white audience.  A vote for her (Clinton) is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime and lost opportunities, Trump said. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and it will never be accepted in a Trump administration.  Clinton won the Democratic nomination in part thanks to her large victory margins among minorities in nearly every state, including overwhelming support from African-Americans in the South. With each passing Trump attack, it becomes clearer that his strategy is just to say about Hillary Clinton whats true of himself, Clinton spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said. When people started saying he was temperamentally unfit, he called Hillary the same. When his ties to the Kremlin came under scrutiny, he absurdly claimed that Hillary was the one who was too close to Putin. Now hes accusing her of bigoted remarks - we think the American people will know which candidate is guilty of the charge. Trump also took aim at Clintons past acceptance of large speaking fees, saying he would force top administration officials to sign a pledge not to accept speaking fees from corporations with registered lobbyists or foreign countries for five years after leaving office. Police violence against African-Americans has set off intermittent, sometimes violent protests in the past two years, igniting a national debate over race and policing in the United States and giving rise to the Black Lives Matter movement. Trump said critics of the police share in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee and other places in our country. The war on our police must end and it must end now, Trump said. The war on police is a war against all peaceful citizens. The shooting of Smith was likely justified, Trump argued in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday morning. But the gun was pointed at his (a police officers) head, supposedly ready to be fired. Who can have a problem with that? Thats what the narrative is, Trump said. Maybe its not true. If it is true, people shouldnt be rioting.  Officials from the Office of Director of National Intelligence are expected to give Trump a briefing on national security issues this week, an adviser to Trump and a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Presidential candidates are entitled to a briefing of classified information after formally securing the nomination, which Trump did last month. Hillary Clinton, Trumps Democratic rival for the Nov. 8 election, is also entitled to receive a briefing if she requests one. Democrats have criticized Trumps positions on foreign policy and national security, besides some freewheeling remarks. Democratic President Barack Obama has called Trump unfit for the presidency and this month warned the Republican candidate that briefing information must be kept secret.

U.S. offers states help to fight election hacking,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The government is offering to help states protect the Nov. 8 U.S. election from hacking or other tampering, in the face of allegations by Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump that the system is open to fraud. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told state officials in a phone call on Monday that federal cyber security experts could scan for vulnerabilities in voting systems and provide other resources to help protect against infiltration, his office said in a statement. Trump has questioned the integrity of U.S. election systems in recent weeks, but his allegations have been vague and unsubstantiated. The attempts to sow doubts about the 2016 election results  coincided with Trumps slide in opinion polls against Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton and missteps in his campaign. His complaints have focused on fears of voter fraud - that people will vote more than once - rather than election rigging. I mean people are going to walk in, theyre going to vote 10 times maybe. Who knows? Theyre going to vote 10 times. So I am very concerned and I hope the Republicans are going to be very watchful, Trump said in an Aug. 3 interview. President Barack Obama dismissed the claims as ridiculous. Of course the elections will not be rigged. What does that mean? Obama said at a news conference the next day. In his phone call, Johnson encouraged the state officials to comply with federal cyber recommendations, such as making sure electronic voting machines are not connected to the internet while voting is taking place, the department said. Concerns in both parties about manipulation of electronic electoral systems are not new. Hackers can wreak havoc in myriad ways, from hijacking a candidates website to hacking voting machines or deleting or changing election records. An Electronic Privacy Information Center report this week said 32 of the 50 states would allow voting by insecure email, fax and internet portals in this election cycle.

Mexico president says he's willing to meet with Trump,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said on Tuesday he was  willing to meet with Donald Trump, months after comparing the Republican presidential candidate to Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Yes, I would meet with him, Pena Nieto said, referring to Trump in a pre-taped television interview broadcast on Tuesday night.  I have never met him. I cant agree with some of the things he has said, but I will be absolutely respectful and will seek to work with whomever becomes the next president of the United States. Trump has sparked outrage in Mexico with his campaign vow to build a wall along the southern U.S. border to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs, and to make Mexico pay for it. In a Mexican newspaper interview in March, Pena Nieto said Mexico would not pay for the proposed wall under any scenario, likening Trumps strident tone to the World War II era dictators.  But at a June summit in Canada, Pena Nieto said he only drew the comparison as a reminder of the devastation wreaked in the past.  ",politicsNews,"August 17, 2016 ",1

Trump ignored facts with dig at Merkel's refugee policy: German minister,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ignored the facts with his assertion that German Chancellor Angela Merkels open-door refugee policy had resulted in a huge increase in crime, a German minister told Reuters on Tuesday. Trump said Merkels decision to welcome more than a million refugees to Germany was a disaster during a campaign rally in Ohio on Monday and said his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton wanted to be like the German leader. In short, Hillary Clinton wants to be Americas Angela Merkel and you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany, Trump said. Crime has risen to levels that no one thought they would ever, ever see. It is a catastrophe. Statistics compiled by the German Interior Ministry showed the number of crimes reported in 2015 - excluding visa violations and other immigration violations - remained essentially unchanged from the previous year at 5.9 million. Michael Roth, Germanys European affairs minister, told Reuters Trumps statement was incorrect and it was important to correct campaign statements in other countries that were based on fears, lies and half-truths, given the importance of the U.S. election for the world. Im sorry that the Republican presidential candidate trumpets out things like that without any factual basis, Roth said. If he had studied the actual situation in Germany, he would know that, while the many refugees who came to Germany and Europe pose a big challenge for us, and everything is still not completely resolved, they have not led to a massive increase in crime rates. Roth said Germany remained a peaceful country where people treated each other with respect, and efforts continued to integrate the refugees into the broader society and economy. German authorities identified 12,710 cases of illegal migration -  mostly from Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq - in the first half of 2016, compared with 128,655 cases in all 2015, Germanys Funke Mediengruppe reported on Tuesday, quoting the governments response to a parliamentary query. It said authorities had stopped about 1 million people to check their immigration status in the first half of the year, compared with about 3 million in the full year of 2015.

Trump names six U.S. governors as agricultural advisors,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump named 64 agriculture policy advisors on Tuesday, including the governors of Iowa and five other farm states and a former federal agriculture secretary. The announcement came as Trump, a New York businessman seeking his first elected office, looks to improve his standing among voters, particularly those in swing states such as Iowa, where some recent opinion polls show Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in a tight race.  Republican Governors Terry Branstad of Iowa, Sam Brownback of Kansas, Jack Dalrymple of North Dakota, Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota, Mary Fallin of Oklahoma and Pete Ricketts of Nebraska were included on a list of advisors distributed by Trumps campaign. Branstad spokesman Ben Hammes said in an interview that the governor will focus on increasing government support for renewable energy as part of the committee. Also on the list were John Block, U.S. agriculture secretary under Republican President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1986, and former Governors Rick Perry of Texas and Jim Gilmore of Virginia, who both unsuccessfully ran against Trump for the Republican nomination. The members of my agricultural advisory committee represent the best that America can offer to help serve agricultural communities, Trump said in a statement. Members of an executive board will convene on a regular basis, he said. Committee members have already talked via telephone to outline some of the issues they expect to tackle, committee member A.G. Kawamura said in an interview. They range from immigration and climate change to global trade and how to define food and energy security for the U.S. in the years ahead, said Kawamura, a former California agriculture secretary. Battles between the agriculture sector and its critics have grown fierce in recent years - from fights over water access in California and declining grain prices, to mounting pressure from consumer groups over how food is produced and labeled. Both presidential campaigns have largely ignored the sector, though, Kawamura said, adding that lack of discussion was one of the reasons he joined Trumps committee. In June, representatives of about a dozen agricultural associations, including the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Farmers Union, met with staffers for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for the first time to begin a discussion on farm policy. Clinton had a 6-percentage-point lead over Trump in a Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll released on Tuesday. ",politicsNews,"August 16, 2016 ",1
Trump to receive first security briefing: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is expected to receive his first national security briefing this week from intelligence officials, sources said on Tuesday. Representatives from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence will give the New York businessman a wide-ranging briefing on foreign policy and national security issues and current threats, but not ultra-sensitive information about ongoing U.S. undercover spy operations or the identities of intelligence sources and methods, according to a source familiar with the matter. The Director of National Intelligence serves as the head of the U.S. intelligence community, advising the president, the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council on matters related to national security. I know that there will be a briefing, and it will be this week, Trump foreign policy adviser Walid Phares confirmed in an email to Reuters. ABC News reported that Trump will be accompanied to the briefing by two top advisers, General Michael Flynn, a former Defense Intelligence Agency chief, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who heads Trumps White House transition team. A source familiar with briefing procedures said that it was unclear whether Flynn and Christie currently have the type of active security clearances that would allow them to participate in such a briefing but that they likely held them in the past. Neither Flynn nor a campaign spokeswoman immediately responded to requests for comment on the briefing. Officials have expressed some concern about whether Trump, who has never held public office, will be able to keep sensitive secrets he might hear to himself. Republicans have pointed out Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, when secretary of state, used a personal email system to transmit allegedly sensitive government messages, some of which were classified Top Secret after the fact. There was no indication on Tuesday that Clinton has thus far requested such a briefing for herself, sources familiar with the briefing process told Reuters. ",politicsNews,"August 16, 2016 ",1

Former Fox News chief Ailes is not advising Trump: campaign,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Roger Ailes, the Fox News chairman ousted last month after sexual harassment allegations, is not advising Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump before the presidential debates in the fall, the campaign said on Tuesday. He is not advising Mr. Trump or helping with debate prep. They are longtime friends but he has no formal or informal role in the campaign, the campaign said.  Earlier, the New York Times had reported that Ailes was advising Trump ahead of the Sept. 26 first presidential debate with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in a role that could stretch beyond the initial Long Island, New York debate.  Ailes resigned from his post as chairman and chief executive of Fox News Channel last month, ending his 20-year reign over the conservative cable news channel, after Fox anchor Gretchen Carlson sued the 76-year-old claiming sexual harassment.  Trump has spoken highly of Ailes in the past, calling him a great guy in a tweet last month.  ",politicsNews,"August 16, 2016 ",1

Clinton names Obama veterans to White House transition team,"WEST HARRISON, N.Y. (Reuters) - Looking to lay the groundwork for her presidency if she wins the White House in November, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton named several veterans of President Barack Obamas administration for her transition team on Tuesday. Ken Salazar, a former interior secretary and U.S. Senator from Colorado, will lead a team of four co-chairs including one-time national security adviser Tom Donilon and Neera Tanden, a former Obama aide who now leads the progressive Center for American Progress think-tank, the Clinton campaign said. The other co-chairs are former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm and Maggie Williams, director of Harvards Institute of Politics, the campaign said in a statement. The announcement came as Clinton has gained momentum in the opinion polls against Republican rival Donald Trump, whose campaign has struggled after he made a string of controversial remarks since formally winning his partys nomination last month. Clinton leads Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election by more than 5 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll released on Friday. The current RealClearPolitics average of polls shows her 6.7 points ahead. Clinton has been a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady and her transition team includes old names from her long tenure in Washington, some of whom have also served Obama. Tanden, who played a key role in shaping Obamas health care overhaul, is a longtime friend and adviser to Clinton who worked on her Senate campaign. Williams was the 1992 transition director for Clinton when she became first lady, and then her chief of staff in the White House when Bill Clinton was president. Two policy advisers on the campaign, Ed Meier and Ann OLeary, will also move full time to the transition team.  Heather Boushey, the executive director of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, will be the chief economist, the campaign said in a statement. Boushey has advised the campaign on economic policy. Transition teams oversee personnel appointments and help develop an administrative framework during the period between the November election and the inauguration in January, to make it easier for a new president to begin implementing policy agendas. Trump, a New York businessman who has never held elected office, picked New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to head his own transition team in May. More establishment Republicans, alarmed by Trumps inability or unwillingness to rein in his provocative remarks, have distanced themselves from the candidate in recent weeks. The Wall Street Journal, a leading conservative voice, said in an editorial on Monday that he should fix his campaign in the next three weeks or hand over to his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Trump drew heavy criticism after engaging in a prolonged spat with the parents of a Muslim U.S. Army captain killed in Iraq. Last week, he suggested gun rights activists could take action against Clinton, a statement critics found alarming but which he later said was aimed at rallying votes against her. Trump also called Obama and Clinton the co-founders of Islamic State, a false claim he later said was sarcastic but did not wholly abandon. Despite Clintons lead in polls, Obama warned Democrats against over confidence, telling a fundraising gathering on Monday in Massachusetts, If we are not running scared until the day after the election, we are going to be making a grave mistake.

Trump promises to work with NATO to defeat Islamic State,"YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump said on Monday he would work closely with NATO allies to defeat Islamic State militants if he wins the White House, reversing an earlier threat that the United States might not meet its obligations to the Western military alliance. In a policy speech, Trump said he would wage a multi-front military, cyber and financial war against Islamic State, although it was not clear how that would differ from the Obama administrations fight with the jihadist group.  We will also work closely with NATO on this new mission, said Trump, whose remarks about the defense organization earlier this summer drew heavy criticism from allies and even some of his fellow Republicans. Trump said a newly adopted approach to fighting terrorism by the organization had led him to change his mind and he no longer considered NATO obsolete. He was apparently referring to reports the alliance is moving toward creating an intelligence post in a bid to improve information sharing.    While Trump appeared to claim credit for prodding NATO to focus more on the threat of terrorism, the 28-nation alliance has been grappling with the issue for more than a decade. NATO invoked Article 5, its collective self-defense mechanism, for the first time in its history to offer support to the United States after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Trump called for shutting down access to the internet and social media for those aligned with Islamic State, which holds territory in Syria and Iraq. But he said he did not want to detail military strategy because it would tip off potential foes. We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism just as we have defeated every threat weve faced at every age and before, Trump said, blaming his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, and President Barack Obama for aiding the rise of Islamic State. In a speech in the swing state of Ohio, Trump also said that in implementing his call for a temporary ban on Muslims immigrating to the country, he would institute extreme vetting and develop a new screening test to try to catch people who intend to do harm to the United States. As president, he said, he would ask the U.S. State Department and Department of Homeland Security to identify regions of the world that remain hostile to the United States and where normal screening might not be sufficient to catch those who pose a threat. The Clinton campaign said Trumps plan to have immigrants submit to ideological tests was a cynical ploy to escape scrutiny of his outrageous proposal to ban an entire religion from our country and no one should fall for it. Reading from a teleprompter, Trump said Clinton did not have the judgment and character to lead the country. Importantly, she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS and all of the many adversaries we face, he said.  Trump, a wealthy New York businessman whose volatile campaign has alienated some in the Republican establishment, faced a fresh rebuke on Monday as he falls behind Clinton in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 8 election. The Wall Street Journal, a leading conservative voice, said in an editorial he should fix his campaign within weeks or step down. Echoing growing alarm about Trumps candidacy among many leading Republicans, the newspaper said Trump had failed to establish a competent campaign operation. If they cant get Mr. Trump to change his act by Labor Day, the GOP will have no choice but to write off the nominee as hopeless and focus on salvaging the Senate and House and other down-ballot races, the newspaper said. Labor Day, which falls on Sept. 5 this year, marks the end of U.S. summer vacations and traditionally launches the final phase of the long U.S. election season.  As for Mr. Trump, he needs to stop blaming everyone else and decide if he wants to behave like someone who wants to be president - or turn the nomination over to Mike Pence, it said, referring to the Indiana governor, who is Trumps vice presidential running mate. Adding to Trumps woes this week was the news, first reported by The New York Times, that the name of his campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was on secret ledgers showing cash payments designated to him of more than $12 million from a Ukrainian political party with close ties to Russia.  Manafort denied any impropriety in a statement on Monday.   I have never received a single off-the-books cash payment as falsely reported by The New York Times, nor have I ever done work for the governments of Ukraine or Russia, he said.  Artem Sytnik, the head of Ukraines anti-corruption bureau, confirmed in a briefing with reporters that Manaforts name appeared on a ledger and that more than $12 million had been allocated as an expenditure, referencing Manafort. But Sytnik said the presence of Manaforts name does not mean that he definitely received this money. The Clinton campaign said the news was evidence of more troubling connections between Donald Trumps team and pro-Kremlin elements in Ukraine. Trump has spoken favorably in the past of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Last month, he invited Russian hackers to find missing emails from Clintons time as secretary of state, when she used a private email server to conduct government business, although he later described that comment as sarcasm.    The current RealClearPolitics average of national opinion polls puts Clinton 6.8 points ahead of Trump, at 47.8 percent to Trumps 41 percent. Polls also show Trump trailing in states such as Pennsylvania that are likely to be pivotal in the election. ",politicsNews,"August 15, 2016 ",1
North Carolina asks Supreme Court to reinstate voter ID law,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Carolina on Monday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow a state law requiring voters to show identification to remain in effect for the Nov. 8 U.S. election despite an appeals court decision that the measure discriminates against minority voters. Lawyers for Republican Governor Pat McCrory said the status quo should be maintained so close to the election, citing court precedent in their favor. The law, which also limited early voting, was enacted in 2013.     The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on July 29 that the law intentionally discriminated against minority voters. The same court refused to put its decision on hold for the November election. Critics say such laws, passed in Republican-governed states, make voting harder for minorities such as African-Americans and Hispanics, who tend to support Democrats. Backers say the laws are necessary to prevent voter fraud. The state directed its request to Chief Justice John Roberts, who has responsibility for emergency requests arising from the federal appeals court that covers the state. The state is not seeking to restore all provisions of the law that were invalidated, meaning some provisions will not be in effect for the election whatever the high court does.

Republican Asia experts say Trump presidency would be 'ruinous',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Asia experts who served in past Republican administrations said on Monday they would back Hillary Clinton in the presidential race as a Donald Trump presidency would lead to ruinous marginalization for the United States in the region. In an open letter, the eight former senior officials said that with global strategic competition growing, including from China, it was absolutely the wrong time to elect an unstable, ill-prepared amateur with no vision or foresight to meet the manifold challenges of the 21st century. They said the Republican nominee offered only bluster or preposterous panaceas for Asia that would wreck our countrys credibility, economy, and leadership in very short order. The signatories to the letter included Michael Green, who served as President George W. Bushs top Asia adviser at the White House, James Clad, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense, and Patrick Cronin, a former senior official at the U.S. Agency for International Development. Should Trump get the chance to put his nostrums into practice, Asian countries would be forced to shift towards states challenging the United States, most notably China, and some might seek security through nuclear weapons, the former officials said. In short, if the Trump brand ... becomes Americas brand, we can expect ruinous marginalization in Asia and unwanted compliance with rules which the Chinese and other challengers set, they said. Their letter was the latest repudiation of Trumps candidacy by Republican national security specialists. Last week, 50 former Republican national security officials, including a former CIA director, called Trump unqualified to lead and said he would be the most reckless president in American history. Trump responded to that statement by deriding the signatories as members of the failed Washington elite who deserve the blame for making the world such a dangerous place. Trump has caused alarm in Asia and beyond by saying he would consider letting Japan and South Korea build their own nuclear weapons, rather than have them relying on the United States for protection against North Korea and China. While making U.S. allies anxious, Trump has also irritated Beijing with his comments, such as by comparing the U.S. trade deficit with China to rape. One Chinese state newspaper equated him to Hitler. At the same time, Beijing also sees Trump as a businessmen with whom it could probably negotiate and may also hope he would be less tough on human rights than Clinton.

Obama warns Democrats against overconfidence about Clinton victory,"CHILMARK, Mass. (Reuters) - Declaring he was tired of talking about Donald Trump, President Barack Obama urged Democrats on Monday not to grow too confident about their prospects in the 2016 election despite Hillary Clintons strong position in the race for the White House. Obama, who is on a two-week vacation in Marthas Vineyard, an island off the coast of Massachusetts, took a short break from his relaxation time to raise money for Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee he hopes will succeed him when he leaves office in January. Clinton leads Trump in opinion polls, and the Republican nominees campaign has suffered following remarks he made denigrating the parents of a fallen Muslim American soldier and charging that Obama was the founder of the Islamic State militant group. The president warned his party, however, to maintain a sense of urgency until the Nov. 8 election.  If we are not running scared until the day after the election, we are going to be making a grave mistake, Obama told some 60 donors who contributed $10,000 each to attend the fundraiser at a private home on the island. If we do our job, then Hillary will be elected president of the United States. But if we do not do our jobs, then its still possible for her to lose. The remarks could foreshadow the presidents role this fall in encouraging get-out-the-vote efforts for Clinton, his former secretary of state.  Obama has made clear his disdain for Trump, calling him unqualified for the White House. He told the donors he was tired of talking about Clintons rival. I dont have to make the case against her opponent, because every time he talks he makes the case against his own candidacy, Obama said. The president is expected to campaign heavily for Clinton in October. ",politicsNews,"August 16, 2016 ",1
Biden: Trump is already making our country less safe,"(Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said on Monday that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps remark that President Barack Obama founded Islamic State had increased threats to the physical safety of U.S. troops in Iraq. Trump is already making our country less safe, Biden told a crowd at a joint Scranton, Pennsylvania, appearance with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.

Republicans seek Trump presidency votes in Israel,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The Israeli branch of the U.S. Republican party began a campaign on Monday to get American voters living in Israel to cast absentee ballots in favor of Donald Trump. According to the Israeli chapter of the Republican party, around 300,000 Americans are eligible to vote in the November presidential elections. They live in Israel or in settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Marc Zell, the head of Republicans Overseas Israel branch,  said the campaign aimed to rekindle interest in U.S. politics among second- and third-generation citizens, many of whom have children who will be eligible to vote for the first time. We want to try to attract new voters who perhaps in the past had no special interest in voting in the U.S. elections, Zell told Reuters. Tzvika Brot, who is heading the campaign, estimated that about three-quarters of American-Israelis would support the Republican party. A Democratic party representative in Israel disputed that estimate, telling Israel Radio the majority of Israeli and U.S. Jewish voters had always preferred the Democrats. A poll of Jewish Israelis conducted in May found 40 percent of respondents backed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and 31 percent supported Trump. The poll didnt specify whether those who responded were eligible to vote in the U.S. election. The pro-Trump drive opened at a shopping mall in the central Israeli town of Modiin and will focus on areas with high concentrations of American-Israelis. Brot said he hoped the new votes being sought might help tip the balance in swing states.  Trump, who has accused the administration of President Barack Obama of lacklustre support for Israel, won his partys nomination for the presidency last month. He has rejected last years nuclear deal with Iran and called for more investment in missile defense in Europe. His views, including a vow to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and a proposal to impose a temporary ban on Muslims seeking to enter the country, have polarized the Republican party and caused widespread consternation. Trump has also been criticized for his lack of foreign policy knowledge. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said last month he would put at risk U.S. and world security with his politics of fear and isolation. ",politicsNews,"August 15, 2016 ",1
Trump rails against press in response to reports of chaos,"FAIRFIELD, Conn. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Donald Trump on Saturday repeated his attack on President Barack Obama that he helped found Islamic State and railed against media reports that his campaign is failing, at a campaign rally in Connecticut, a state where he has a long-shot of being victorious.  Speaking for more than an hour in a sweltering room, Trump spent a significant portion of his speech complaining about the media.    He again threatened to revoke the press credentials of The New York Times. The credentials allow reporters access to press-only areas of his campaign events. He has already banned other outlets, including The Washington Post.  On Saturday, the New York newspaper published an article detailing failed efforts to make Trump focus his campaign on the general election. These are the most dishonest people, Trump said. Maybe well start thinking about taking their press credentials away from them.      Trump visiting Connecticut, a heavily Democratic state, raised eyebrows among many Republicans. Its asinine that he would be in Connecticut holding a public rally less than 90 days before the election, said Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak. You dont see Hillary publicly campaigning in Idaho and Mississippi. I have to think this proves the candidate is running the campaign, which explains why its such a disaster of biblical proportions. At several points the crowd chanted lock her up, a frequent campaign rally chant in reference to Trumps Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.  Trump told the crowd that normally he responds by saying he intends instead to defeat her in the Nov. 8 election, but this time added, You know what? You have a point! Trump also dropped his recent efforts to say he was not being serious when he said Obama was the founder of the Islamic State militant group .  Its the opinion of myself and a lot of people that he was the founder, Trump told the crowd. Democrats and Republicans alike have criticized Trumps assertion as patently false.     Trump took a detour from attacking Clintons economic record to discuss the 1998 scandal involving White House intern Monica Lewinsky and former President Bill Clinton, whom Republicans attempted to impeach.  Remember when he said, he did not have sex with that woman, and a couple of weeks later, oh you got me, Trump said, to cheers. He then made reference to a blue dress that became a symbol in the investigation. Im so glad they kept that dress, so glad they kept that dress, because it shows what the hell they are.

Factbox: U.S. Republican lawmakers who say they won't vote for Trump,"(Reuters) - Senator Ben Sasse was in a fairly lonely place when he wrote on his Facebook page back in February that he could not support Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. That is changing. Since Sasse, a Nebraska Republican, staked out his position, the ranks of Republican Trump critics in the U.S. Congress have grown, with the New York real estate mogul stirring almost constant turmoil within his party. The following are Republicans in Congress who have said they will not vote for Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election, followed by those who have said they are keeping their options open. Senator Ben Sasse. Wrote in February he could not support Trump or his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Sasse wrote: Mr. Trumps relentless focus is on dividing Americans, and on tearing down rather than building back up this glorious nation. Senator Lindsey Graham. A strong Trump critic, Graham sought the Republican presidential nomination, but drew little support. He has told reporters he may write in someone for president. Senator Mark Kirk. The Illinois lawmakers faces a tough battle for re-election and withdrew his endorsement of Trump in June, citing Trumps attacks on Hispanics, women and the disabled like me. Kirk had a stroke in 2012 and uses a wheelchair. He told CNN on Aug. 10 that he will write in former Secretary of State Colin Powell for president. Senator Susan Collins. The Maine moderate said in a Washington Post opinion article on Aug. 8 that she will not vote for Trump or Clinton. She has said she may write in another candidate. Representative Carlos Curbelo. A Cuban-American from Florida, Curbelo was an early Trump critic. If the nominee is a fraud, and someone whos offensive, and incapable of being an effective president like Donald Trump, I wont support him, Curbelo told Reuters in February. Representative Justin Amash. A libertarian-leaning Michigan congressman, Amash says Trumps policies go in the wrong direction. Im not voting for him, he told Reuters in March. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. A Cuban-American whose south Florida district is next door to Curbelos, Ros-Lehtinen said in May that she will not support Trump or Clinton. Representative Bob Dold. A longtime Trump critic from Illinois who plans to write someone in. Representative Adam Kinzinger. Another Illinoisan, Kinzinger told CNN on Aug. 3 he did not see how he could support Trump. Representative Charlie Dent. The Pennsylvanian said earlier this month he was not planning to vote for Trump or Clinton. Representative Richard Hanna. On Aug. 2, Hanna, of New York state, became the first House Republican to say he will vote for Clinton. He is retiring from Congress at the end of this year. Representative Scott Rigell. A Virginian who is also retiring from Congress, Rigell said on Aug. 7 that he would vote for the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson. Representative Reid Ribble. The Wisconsinite already was blasting Trump last September, saying Trump was doing serious damage to the Republican brand and that he could not support him. Ribble is retiring from Congress. Some prominent lawmakers have not endorsed Trump, but will not say whether they will vote for him, leaving their options open. Senator Jeff Flake. The Arizona lawmaker on Aug. 9 said there was slim hope he could vote for Trump, and added Trump could not win the presidency unless he changes. Senator Pat Toomey. A Pennsylvanian in a tight re-election race, Toomey has not endorsed Trump and says he has not made a decision on what he will do. Senator Ted Cruz. A conservative Texan and former Trump rival for the Republican nomination, Cruz was booed at the Republican convention after he pointedly did not endorse Trump and urged delegates to vote your conscience. Senator Mike Lee. A Cruz ally, the Utah senator says he has concerns about whether Trump is conservative enough. He has not endorsed and he has no plans to do so, a Lee spokesman said. Representative Mike Coffman. The Colorado lawmaker has not ruled out voting for Trump, but put out a television ad saying I dont care for him much. Representative Fred Upton. From Michigan, he says he is not endorsing anyone and has not said for whom he will vote. ",politicsNews,"August 15, 2016 ",1
Talk of shifting funds away from Trump premature: Republican official,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior official with the Republican National Committee on Sunday played down the prospect that the party would cut off cash and logistical support to White House nominee Donald Trump in order to shift resources toward congressional races. Last week 70 Republicans wrote a letter urging the RNC to stop helping Trump and to focus instead on candidates for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. The letter, signed by former members both of Congress and RNC staff, said Trumps actions were divisive and dangerous and posed a threat to the party and the country.  Sean Spicer, RNC communications director, said in a telephone interview that abandoning Trump with nearly three months to go to the Nov. 8 election doesnt make logical sense.  In October 1996 the RNC moved money from the presidential race to congressional candidates after Republican nominee Bob Dole fell far behind Democratic President Bill Clinton in opinion polls. But Spicer said giving up on Trump could be harmful to other Republican candidates and there was still time for him to rebound in opinion polls against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Number one, you need a strong top of the ticket. Thats number one. Number two, were only six points down, Spicer said, referring to the gap that Clinton has opened up against Trump in some national polls. Clinton led Trump by more than five percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday. Clinton has strong leads in hotly contested states such as Pennsylvania and New Hampshire and some polls show her within a few percentage points of Trump in some states such as Georgia that normally lean strongly Republican. Any discussions of cutting off funds to Trump in August would be ridiculous, Spicer said. Trump has polarized the party with his vow to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and his plan to impose a temporary ban on Muslims seeking to enter the country. Trump has been criticized by both Republicans and Democrats for a prolonged feud with the Muslim family of a fallen U.S. Army captain and his assertion last week that President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton had co-founded the Islamic State militant group.

"Disillusionment, U.S.A. Where voters are just hoping for change.","ALGONAC, MICH.Parker Fox drifted out of the Donald Trump rally in a sort of euphoric daze, along with the thousands emptying into the parking lot alongside him. After leaving a Trump rally, youre very pro-Trump, he recalled a few weeks later, describing a noisy communion with people who understood that politics mattered, unlike some people he could name at his high school. It was so enthusiastic and so energetic you could feel it in your body. It gave you chills. Hed barely had time to calm down when he learned through Facebook that his other favorite presidential candidate would also be passing through his quiet corner of eastern MichiganBernie Sanders. In fact, the U.S. senator from Vermont would be at the same community college the very next day. This thrilled Fox: his first presidential election as a voterhe was 18and the two most crowd-whipping, pundit-defying, establishment-bucking candidates in the entire race were practically paying him personal visits.  As it turned out, the residents of this part of Michigan were especially fond of the two men who had done the most to upend the 2016 presidential race. Both Sanders and Trump won the state, with Sanders narrow win in the Democratic contest stupefying pollsters who had predicted a comfortable lead for Hillary Clinton. Both did especially well in St. Clair County, with double-digit victories over their rivals. And, down at the precinct level, they barnstormed Algonac, a town of about 4,056 people about an hours drive from Detroit on a curve of the St. Clair River in the countys southern end corner, and neighboring Clay, home to another 9,066 or so, including Fox and his family. In some Algonac and Clay precincts, Sanders and Trump won more than two thirds of the votes. Residents have a needlessly unflattering nickname for Algonac: The Swamp, derived, apparently, from the reed marshes that engulf the towns edges and which are prettily dive-bombed by feeding birds and buzz with hidden insects. If Sanders and Trump were the two insurgents of 2016, then the Algonac Swamp must be a sort of encampment of their guerrilla foot soldiers. What might such a place be like, down in the trenches? An editors working hypothesis was that a town full of Trump and Sanders fans might turn out to be the Angriest Town in America, and so that became our shorthand before my visit in April, only to be laughed at when I finally got the chance to broach the label with residents.   Of course, no one can persist in a permanent state of anger, especially in an entire town. Contempt, on the other hand, can smolder indefinitely, and Algonac reeked of contempt: It would take longer than a weeks visit to find someone here who does not think Washington is, on the whole, a besmirched place of selfish politicians in thrall to the powerful moneyed interests who keep them in office. Clinton, fairly or otherwise, is generally seen here as the very embodiment of this; Sanders and Trump the only possible saviors, Trump because hes never held elected office, and Sanders, despite his decades in Congress, because he is still viewed as a cranky outsider. Nonetheless, for a small minority, the idea of a President Trump sends them into a panic.  Fox is young enough to have never had his heart broken by a politician, but hes heard his father, Jerry, go off at the dinner table enough times to pick up some of his parents wariness. He might get a lot of this because I work for the auto industry, said Jerry, who has a job at a nearby Chrysler truck factory and is a competitive walleye fisherman on the side. Father and son were sitting on couches in the familys comfy living room, with large windows looking out onto surrounding woods where deer and turkeys roam. Jerry had also been struggling over whether he preferred Trump or Sanders, and so had decided to let his politics-inhaling son make the call for him. Ive always heard dad saying, you know, There goes another plant to Mexico, Fox said, doing an angry-dad voice, as Jerry gave a smiling its true nod of recognition. And so Fox marveled to hear Trump lambast companies for moving production abroad, or Sanders refrain that 60,000 factories have closed down in America since 2001. The rallies were like a Fox family dinner blown up to stadium size. COMPASSION VERSUS WALL-BUILDING Should either candidate want to make a movie adaptation of their campaign speeches, they could do worse than to set it in Algonac and Clay: A few strip-mall businesses and a scattering of mostly two-story, middle-class homes, none too far from the teal waters of the St. Clair River, along which massive freighters creep carrying goods to and from Canada. To wander around Algonac, a predominantly Republican place, is to encounter familiar stump-speech lines made manifest. Theres the towns old Chris-Craft power boat factory that made Algonac a proud little manufacturing hub until it closed in 1960, a hole thats never quite been filled or forgotten. Algonac falls within the gravitational pull of Detroits Big Three automobile companies; the factories of General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler are major employers, and families fortunes are tied to international trade deals that both Trump and Sanders deride. Ford, in particular, has come under attack from Trump for expanding its manufacturing in Mexico. The only other language besides English on the signs at the nearest major airport, Detroit Metropolitan, is Japanese, viewed by some residents as an unnecessary concession to visiting Japanese automobile executives. When talk turns to immigrationSanders in terms of compassion, Trump in terms of wall-buildingpeople here are reminded of the U.S. Border Patrol officers they see boating up and down the Canadian border, which floats somewhere halfway across the St. Clair River. Both candidates decry what they say is the undue influence of American billionaires on politics. In Algonac, they tend to picture Manuel Moroun, a Detroit businessman, in the local version of this role. He proposed building a bridge that was widely opposed here, connecting the mainland to Harsens Island, a peaceful outpost of Clay Township, home to about 1,200 people and a couple of bald eagles and currently accessible only by a small, 12-car ferry. Regulators denied the $45 million plan in June. In some ways, voters have changed little since the 1980s, when pollster Stan Greenberg first visited neighboring Macomb County and announced that he had discovered the Reagan Democrat. The belief persists that the system is so rigged that politicians largesse only flows to those much richer than you, or much poorer, leaving you to struggle unaided. The difference this timeand everyone agrees its different this timeis that there were two viable-seeming chances to send a man to Washington who would be the very personification of your contempt. Some were voting for Trump only in his capacity as a stink bomb. You guys know the story, Im sure, of Jesus Christ in the temple, when he goes into the temple and he turns everything upside down, said Jay DeBoyer, the only person dressed in a suit on a weekday afternoon in Johnnie Legas, a popular riverside Algonac dive bar filled with nautical-themed clutter. He worked behind the bar years ago when he was a student before becoming a salesman for a company that made trusses and other lumber products for the home-building industry. Now DeBoyer is the county clerk, whose job includes running elections here. He has a close-shaved head and silver goatee, his suit fits well, and he speaks in neat paragraphs of political analysis. He was evoking a rare moment in the Gospels, in which the normally sanguine Christ appears to get angry at the corrupting quality of money, as he explained why the countys primary results were more or less as he anticipated. Now, we can argue from a Christian perspective, was that Christ-like? We can have that debate, that discussion. But for every circumstance theres a reaction and theres a resolution. In his analogy, Christ was Trump, but Sanders, too, and also, in a sense, the voters themselves, newly awakened at the possibility of disruption. In these non-engaged individuals who are becoming engaged, they want him to go into the temple and turn the tables upside down, DeBoyer said. That means we need to shake it up. We need to come back to the people in control. In DeBoyers view, this may be the first election in which the so-called culture wars will not prove decisive. DeBoyer is a Republican, though he declined to say for whom he voted. Hes pro-gun and opposes abortion, but is unfazed, for example, by Trumps difficulty in stating what his policy on abortion access would be. Most Trump voters he knows dont care if they only agree with two in 10 things that Trump says, according to DeBoyer. They just want a change. He described his familys finances to explain why. I dont have a bunch of debt. I have a mortgage and a couple of car payments. I dont have a pension; I have to save in a 401k like everyone else. Its impossible for me to save enough money to pay for my kids to go to college. He has a 13-year-old son and a 17-year-old daughter, who is applying to Duke. Mathematically impossible. I live in a $125,000 house, I drive a Dodge pick-up truck and a Jeep, I dont have any credit card debt. None of that. And its mathematically impossible for me to save enough for retirement and enough to send my kids to college. Household income of $100,000, with no debt. Do you understand how a person in my exact financial category gets sucked into that world, between those two? If I tend to lean to the left, Im all in with Bernie Sanders. If I tend to lean right, Im all in with Donald Trump. Frankly, even if hes wrong, what hes saying are the only options I have, the only hope I got. Leaving Johnnie Legas to head into Algonac proper, you pass by the taxidermy store of Paul Burczyckia Trump supporter with qualms. He is angry with the government not least because his insurance payments went up with the passage of the Affordable Care Act. Trumps a tough guy to vote for, he said. Hes a loose cannon. Maybe thats all part of his master plan. Further down the road, on the right, theres Peter Beauregards Algonac Harbour Club on the right, a marina and restaurant on the spot of the old Chris-Craft factory.  Hes a Trump fan, too. Im a lifetime Republican who has been disenchanted like, I guess, a lot of people in our town, so Im definitely for the outsider, Beauregard said, and Ive upset several of my local colleagues who are Republicans. If youre a Republican you either love him or you hate him. Theres nobody on the fence. Life here revolves around the water. Almost as many driveways are graced by boats as cars. Garfield Wood, a pioneering boat builder and racer who once lived in Algonac, broke the water speed record in 1932, tearing along the St. Clair in a boat powered by airplane engines at 124.86 miles per hour. Chris-Craft made a landing craft used by the U.S. military in the D-Day invasion at Normandy, as well as mahogany-hulled powerboats that are still cherished by nostalgic collectors. The Michigan Senate is contemplating a bill that would recognize Clay Township, Algonacs neighbor, as the sturgeon angling capital of the state, and some residents think it will sail through committee. Its beautiful in the summer, residents say, with people boating in the sunshine and the restaurants busy with seasonal visitors. Nevertheless, multiple residents liked to efface the town using the same little shorthand list, as if theyd all memorized it from the same source: Algonac? Its three dollar stores, one grocery store, three pharmacies, and thats about it. About 97 percent of the residents are white, according to the last census, compared to 74 percent for the United States as a whole. Both Trump and Sanders have found their most reliable support among those in this racial group. It is only after several days in Algonac, at the annual American Indian Festival at the local high school, that I find someone willing to say she is a Clinton supporter, if in a limited sense. Ringed by chairs in the school gym, dancers moved to throbbing drums; fox furs, tribal jewelry and dreamcatchers were for sale at stalls around the gyms edge, many run by members of tribes from Walpole Island, just across the Canadian border. Susan Wrobel, the festivals organizer and a lifelong Algonac resident, runs a weekly community meeting where she teaches children Anishinaabemowin, the language of her Ojibwe tribe. She said elders there have been shaking their heads in wonder and fear that Trump could become president. I was very pleased whether it was Hillary or Bernie, I actually I like them both, she said. She had just bought some new earrings, which danced as she spoke. So I chose the Republican ticket to vote for my favorite Republican, and that was Kasich. I love Kasich. Hes the only one that talked about doing something about the national debt, and I loved that. So I thought, well, the Democratic tickets taken care of for me. Michigans primaries are open to all voters regardless of party affiliation, and strategic voting is common. A few days after this conversation, John Kasich, the Ohio governor, would drop out of the race. Once again, it was time for the Algonac-Clay Historical Societys monthly meeting. Some of the women at the society are particularly interested in the Victorian era and were making final arrangements for a forthcoming talk on Victorian hair fashions. Hats and tea cups are encouraged, noted the flyer. Trump struck them as unnecessarily crude. I dont like the name calling, said Marilynn Genaw, who was in charge of ordering the strawberries theyd need for the tea. Its good manners not to say something derogatory about an individual. She was still deciding on how to vote. Joan Bulley, a former Algonac bank teller and the towns de facto historian-in-residence, could also do without Trumps brusqueness, but wonders if it points to an underlying virtue. One thing about Donald Trump is he tells it as it is, she said. I dont care for his rudeness, his insults, but he gets things done. Sanders, she said, is at least a little bit more dignified in his speeches.  She dislikes Clinton. She doesnt tell the truth. I dont like that. Bulleys grievance with the federal government is that she has never quite forgiven it for transforming the citys waterfront under the urban renewal push of the 1960s and 1970s. Urban renewal demolished our town she said. She pointed to an exhibit in the societys museum, a little hand-drawn map of the businesses that used to line a walkable, 19th-century main street on the riverfront: Kochs Jewelry Store, the Starlight Dance Pavilion, the Algonac Theatre. For the most part, those buildings were demolished and replaced with a pleasant, if quiet, boardwalk backed by tidy lawns, and, on the other side, the sort of boxy, parking-lot-fringed architecture that lures chain stores and franchise restaurants. She kept pointing at the exhibits. This was Henrys on the corner, she said, referring to one of her favorite restaurants. Its now a parking lot, which is stupid. If they would have saved some of these stores we would at least have something to attract people. As the historical society meeting breaks up for homemade snacks and cake, I meet Bud Zeigler, 85, who spent 12 years sanding down Chris-Craft powerboats on the assembly line until the factory moved to Florida, taking some of his colleagues with it. Soon after, he ended up as a carpenter making Pontiacs at General Motors down the road, working there for 30 years until retirement. His complaint about the government is that its always the same old faces in charge, who never seem to get things done. I voted for Bernie Sanders, he said. I just wanted to break it up a little bit. Because everybody figures this one is favored, that one is favored, well, give the other guy a chance. He chuckles a bit at this. Somewhere along the line youve got to get somebody in there that maybe can change things a bit with a new thought in their head, without having the same ones always running for office, families running, you know? Even in late April, there was little doubt that itd be Clinton versus Trump come November. Trump thinks he can flip Michigan, a state that has reliably gone with theDemocratic presidential candidate for years, to support him. At the Schoolhouse Grille, a buzzing restaurant on Harsens Island, two women stepped outside at the end of the Saturday night dinner rush. Sheltering from the drizzle in an outdoor bar area, the two friends discussed how they would approach the polling booths in November. Kristin Bane, who owns the restaurant and was seeking to escape the kitchens heat, is a Democrat who voted for Sanders. She likes Obama not least because she also spent part of her childhood in Hawaii, opposes fracking and thinks the government should spend more on education. Nancy Bryson, who came out for a smoke and whose family runs the islands ferry service to the mainland, most admires the two presidents Bush. I enjoy listening to Bernie, Bryson said. I do. And I think that there are so many things that hes saying that Im, You know what? I agree with you wholeheartedly. But I dont want the government to tell me that I have to do that. I dont want to be taxed to do that. Bryson argued that Trump would help bring the country back to its founding principle. Bane was unconvinced. How can we vote for a man whos proposing to build a wall that we have spent so many years breaking down in other countries? Bane said as Bryson lit a cigarette.  My grandfathers and my uncles have died because they were trying to break down walls in other countries so that we could live freeand we want to build one? Thats the wrong message. OK, I disagree with you there but I love you, Bryson replied. Her mother was an immigrant, she explained, arriving at Ellis Island from Copenhagen as a 12-year-old girl. The barriers to immigration are higher than they were in the Ellis Island era, but Bryson said there was still no good reason to immigrate to the United States through anything but the legal channels.  Ive been wanting to have this conversation for a long time, Bane said, without backing down on her point. Its good that we can do this and not get angry and stomp our feet about it. They found common ground in their dislike for Clinton. And Benghazi? Bryson said. I mean its just unforgivable what happened there. I think shes a professional liar, Bane said.I agree. Still, for Bane, the idea of having to vote for someone other than Sanders in November left her anguished. I could say, Oh, you know, change, yes change, I want change, and so Trump is the quickest way to a change in government. I could tell myself that hopefully its going to work out for the best. But I cant get past some of these issues like the wall, and I cant get past some of these issues like abortion. A woman should go to jail. What the fuck? It became apparent that Bryson was not aware that Trump has said he now opposes abortions. This new information was absorbed quickly.  Oh, hes going anti? she said. Well you know what, heres the bottom line, hes just trying to buy the Christian base. Neither was surprised at how well Sanders and Trump had done in Michigan.The common ground with them is change, Bane said. Anti-establishment, Bryson said. Heres how I feel, Bane said, in a sort of closing statement. I would hope that Bernie would get in at least to in to run against Trump. I have no time for Hillary Clinton. And when it comes down to it I more than likely will not vote for her. And if it comes down to her and Trump, even though I cringe and I think whats going to happen, I at least will have some hope of some kind of change. Somethings going to shift if he gets in there. Somethings got to give. And at least there would be that hope still attached to him. With her, I almost fear her. I think shes a dangerous woman. I think shes an extremely dangerous woman. Again, she worried about Trumps wall and his position on abortion. A painful change is still change.The two women smiled at each other and hugged and then hurried through the drizzle back into the restaurant. Fox and his parents were approaching November with less trepidation. After attending the Trump and Sanders rallies in quick succession, he made up his mind and informed his parents, who were similarly torn between the two, of his decision. Fox thinks women should be allowed to have abortions and that same-sex couples should be able to marry, views he attributes to his age, and here he felt he parted company with Trump. I couldnt find anything with Bernie I disagree about. At all. And thats the reason. As simple as it gets. Also, he said, it seemed like Trump didnt need my help, he said, which was part of his fathers thinking, too. They would vote for Trump in November instead. Foxs mother, Tracy, came in from work and sat down in an armchair opposite her sons; her husband moved to sit at the floor by her feet. The family talked politics for another hour as the room darkened, illuminated only by a muted CNN flashing on the television. Both of my guys won, Fox said with satisfaction, so thats cool.

Trump backs off ISIS comments; party head appears at rallies in show of unity,"ALTOONA, Pa. (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump on Friday backed away from comments calling President Barack Obama and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton the founders of the militant group Islamic State, while the Republican Party sought to project unity behind their candidate.      A new poll showed Trump, whose unfiltered speaking style has repeatedly landed him in hot water, losing ground in three crucial states ahead of the Nov. 8 general election against Clinton. In a surprise appearance, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who in private expressed fury over some of Trumps actions earlier this month, introduced the candidate at a campaign event in Erie, Pennsylvania, and the two hugged onstage. Were so honored to be working with Donald Trump and the campaign, Priebus told thousands of Trump supporters. And dont believe the garbage you read. Let me tell you something. Donald Trump, the Republican Party, all of you, were going to put him in the White House and save this country together. Republican sources earlier this month said Priebus was furious over Trumps failure to endorse House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and his feud with the parents of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq. Trump did endorse Ryan a few days later. Trump brought Priebus on stage later at another rally, in Altoona, Pennsylvania, to thank him for the work he has done as he insisted there is great unity in the party. I have to say we have great unification, Trump said. Trump on Friday told the rallies in Altoona and Erie that his remarks earlier this week calling Obama and Clinton the founders of ISIS, as Islamic State is also known, had been sarcastic. I have been saying because its true, but somewhat sarcastically, that hes the founder of ISIS and shes a close second, Trump said in Altoona. Trump first made the unfounded claim on Wednesday and repeated it through the week. Trump claimed sarcasm in July as well after he was heavily criticized for inviting Russia to dig up tens of thousands of missing emails from Clintons time as U.S. secretary of state. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released on Friday suggested support for Trump is eroding among voters in three battleground states. Such states are hotly contested because their populations can swing either to Republicans or Democrats and thus play a decisive role in presidential elections, which are ultimately decided by the state-by-state tally of the Electoral College. The poll found Clinton widening her lead in Colorado, Virginia and North Carolina, while holding her advantage in Florida.  Clinton released her tax returns on Friday, painting the move as a sign of transparency that her campaign says Trump lacks. U.S. presidential candidates are not required to release their tax returns, but it has become a common custom. Trump has cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service in refusing to release his returns. Trump also has said his taxes are no ones business and that they reveal little. Trump scheduled a speech in Warren, Ohio, on Monday that will focus on how he would handle the threat posed by Islamic State. Trump has said he would knock the hell out of ISIS, without offering details. Trump has been mired in repeated controversies in recent days. He drew heavy criticism after he suggested gun rights activists could take action against Clinton, a statement he later said was aimed at rallying votes against her. Nearly one-fifth of registered Republicans now want Trump to drop out of the race for the White House, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday. Republicans frequently trace the birth of Islamic State to the Obama administrations decision to withdraw the last U.S. forces from Iraq by the end of 2011. But many analysts argue its roots lie in the decision of George W. Bushs Republican administration to invade Iraq in 2003 without a plan to fill the vacuum created by Saddam Husseins ouster. It was Bushs administration that negotiated the 2009 agreement that called for the withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Iraq by Dec. 31, 2011. At his Erie event, Trump seemed to acknowledge he is facing a formidable opponent in Clinton as well as a difficult electoral path. The Republicans have a tougher path  not my fault, he said. He said Clintons campaign is smart to keep her out of the spotlight. She doesnt talk to reporters very often. ... She doesnt expose whats going on up here, which isnt good, he said, meaning her brain. Shes doesnt expose her mind to questions. What they want to do is try to fake it through. Trump also said in Altoona that the only way he could lose Pennsylvania to Clinton is if cheating goes on. He said he wants authorities to monitor the voting closely. I know whats happening here, folks. She cant beat whats happening here. ",politicsNews,"August 12, 2016 ",1
U.S. Democrat Pelosi gets 'obscene and sick' calls after hack,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said on Saturday she has been flooded with obscene and sick calls and text messages after a hacker linked to Russia posted personal contact information online for her and hundreds of other Democratic lawmakers and aides. Pelosi sent a letter to colleagues warning them to take precautions and said she was changing her phone number after a hacker identified as Guccifer 2.0 posted the personal cellphone numbers and email addresses on Friday.  The posted information appeared to have been gained in the electronic breach of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the fundraising and campaign arm of Democrats in the House of Representatives. Other Democratic campaign groups, including the Democratic National Committee, also were targeted by the cyber attack, which was made public late last month. On a personal note, I was in the air flying from Florida to California when the news broke. Upon landing, I have received scores of mostly obscene and sick calls, voicemails and text messages, Pelosi told her colleagues, urging them to keep their phones and incoming text messages away from their family members and children. This is a sad course of events, not only for us, but more importantly for our country, said Pelosi, who earlier in the week blamed Russia for the cyber attack and called it an electronic Watergate akin to the 1972 burglary at Democratic Party headquarters that ultimately brought down Republican President Richard Nixon. John Ramsey, the Houses chief information security officer, sent a memo to lawmakers and aides whose information had been made public urging them to change passwords for all their accounts and to consider changing their non-House email addresses. He said the hacker had uploaded a spreadsheet with a mix of House and personal email addresses and cellphone numbers for nearly every House Democrat and an assorted number of Republicans, and similar information for hundreds of staffers. Along with the Excel file, Guccifer 2.0 uploaded documents that included the account names and passwords for an assortment of subscription services used by the DCCC. Initial analysis identifies some members home addresses, along with their spouses name, marital status, and religion, the memo said. U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that Guccifer 2.0 is an individual or group operating with or for the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency. Russia has denied involvement in the breach. The potential Russian involvement in the cyber attack has ignited a fierce campaign debate, with Democrats accusing the Russians of trying to aid Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. But U.S. officials suspect the operation and others directed at the DNC and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintons campaign were more likely an attempt to pursue email chains into classified networks or in search of national security policy information than to influence the Nov. 8 U.S. election. The Russian assumption probably is that it doesnt matter much who wins the election, because Wall Street and other powerful lobbies really run the country, one of the officials said on Saturday, speaking like the others on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments. The old Soviet belief hasnt faded completely when it comes to foreign policy, the official said. ",politicsNews,"August 13, 2016 ",1
"Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent. In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department. Clintons running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns. They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency, Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement. In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns. It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public, although they are not required by law to do so.  Clintons tax returns have been made public, in some form, every year since 1977. Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns. Trump also has said his taxes are no ones business and that they reveal little. Your move, Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominees returns. The Trump campaign dismissed Clintons action, saying in a statement: This document release is nothing more than an attempt at distraction and misdirection from controversy about her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. The IRS has said Trump can release his tax returns even while under audit. On Thursday, Trumps special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete. Trumps critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia.     Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes. On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan. He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns, she told the crowd. Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case. Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election. Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent. President Barack Obama also backs the proposal. At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns. Buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is afraid not of the tax-collection agency but of voters.  Clintons campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007. The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent. The Clintons 2015 return showed that, unlike most Americans, just $100 of their income came from wages. Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $109,000. ",politicsNews,"August 12, 2016 ",1
"Liz Cheney's Wyoming campaign backed by big names, bigger money","CODY, Wyo. (Reuters) - Former Vice President Dick Cheneys eldest daughter, bouncing back from an aborted 2014 U.S. Senate bid, heads into a crowded primary race next week for Wyomings lone seat in the House of Representatives buoyed by big-name Republicans and wealthy out-of-state donors. Liz Cheney, the apparent Republican front-runner, has commanded a level of fund-raising and A-list party support - including two former presidents and onetime Cabinet members - that is rare, if not unheard of, for a relative newcomer to Wyoming politics. Her strength is even more significant in a solidly red state where the Republican primary winner is virtually assured victory in the general election. She can go to Chicago or New York, and in one fund-raiser pull in more money than the next two closest candidates combined, said Deb Oakley Simpson, a daughter-in-law of former longtime Wyoming Republican Senator Alan Simpson and a Cody-based civic activist who backs one of Cheneys primary foes, state Senator Leland Christensen. To date, Cheney, 49, has received individual donations totaling more than $1.1 million, far outpacing the collective campaign receipts of her seven Republican opponents and the two Democrats running in Wyomings primary elections on Tuesday. According to the latest opinion poll on the race, conducted during the second week of July, more than half of Wyoming voters were undecided, but Cheney led with 21 percent, more than twice the following of her nearest competitor. Her standing marks a striking turnaround from her first bid for public office, when she returned to her home state three years ago to challenge incumbent Senator Mike Enzi and was branded by some fellow Republicans as a carpetbagger backed by deep-pocketed outsiders. Her campaign also suffered from a public feud with her sister Mary Cheney, a lesbian, over Liz Cheneys opposition to same-sex marriage.  She ended up withdrawing from that race several months later, citing a family health crisis. Cheney and her husband, Phil Perry, an attorney, have five children. Now Cheney, also a lawyer who worked in the State Department while her father was vice president, is leveraging her Washington connections as she runs for the open, at-large House seat in the nations least populous state. Campaigning as a strong conservative voice for Wyoming, she has vowed to protect the states pivotal coal industry, defend gun rights and generally work to reverse President Obamas devastating policies. Among her contributors are a prominent group of her fathers former high-ranking government colleagues, including former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, as well as former Secretary of State James Baker, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and former White House political adviser Karl Rove. Other prominent donors include New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, Colorado oil and entertainment magnate Philip Anschutz, brewing executive Pete Coors, Texas financier T. Boone Pickens, and Chicago real estate and media investor Sam Zell. Cheneys two closest Republican primary rivals are state Representative Tim Stubson and Christensen, who rank second and third, respectively, in fund-raising and in polls.  They have raised $255,000 combined in individual donations. Cheney, who was on the campaign trail and unavailable for comment, has accepted no political action committee funds, and PAC funding has figured little in the race. She raised the bulk of her campaign money by the end of March, with nearly half of individual contributions meeting the $2,700 limit set by federal election laws. Most came from outside Wyoming. Still, Cheney has raised more money from more Wyoming donors than any of her opponents, and contributions from all 50 states, campaign manager Bill Novotny said.  A national effort is what its going to take to stand up to Hillary Clinton at the top of the Democratic ticket in November, he added. ",politicsNews,"August 13, 2016 ",1
"Clinton happily yields national spotlight to Trump, avoids its glare","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If you havent heard a lot about what Hillary Clinton thinks of a string of controversial comments by Donald Trump that have generated round-the-clock coverage on cable news broadcasts, there is a reason  its by design. Since becoming the Democratic nominee last month, Clinton has been touring toy manufacturers, visiting tie makers and dropping in on public health clinics, where if she mentions Trump at all, it is usually to contrast their policies. Her swift condemnation at a Wednesday campaign rally of Trumps remark that gun rights activists could stop her from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices was a rare instance where she has directly engaged her Republican rival in the 2016 race for the White House. Aides say Clintons strategy is simple: let Trump be Trump. Trump has suffered a series of missteps over the past two weeks that go beyond his remarks on gun rights activists, which he later accused the media of deliberately misinterpreting. He has tangled with party leaders, clashed with the parents of a fallen Muslim American Army captain and this week accused Clinton, a former secretary of state, and President Barack Obama of founding the Islamic State militant group. On Friday, he said he was just being sarcastic when he made that remark.  There is an adage in politics:  Dont get in the way of a train wreck, said Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, a top campaign aide to presidential candidates Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004. Clintons advisers say they see little benefit in her going toe-to-toe with Trump over every personal accusation, generating sound bites that would dominate cable news broadcasts. Rather, they are happy for him to be embroiled in controversy while Clinton focuses on policy. Trumps campaign declined to comment for this story, but the New York real estate developer has accused the national media of bias toward Clinton. He re-posted a supporters Tweet on Friday that said the corrupt media was deliberately exaggerating his remarks to favor his Democratic opponent.  Trump has slipped in opinion polls, and worried Republican Party leaders have urged him to stop making off-the-cuff inflammatory statements that generate blanket, often negative, media coverage and distract from efforts to highlight what they see as Clintons many shortcomings. Hes sucking all the oxygen out of the room to his own detriment, said Republican strategist and Trump supporter Ford OConnell. Its not enough to dominate media coverage, he needs to win it, OConnell said. Trump has boasted that the news coverage he generates means he does not have to spend as much on campaign ads, but political veterans say he is squandering the attention and missing opportunities to win over undecided voters. For example, Trump gave an economic speech on Monday that was meant to help his campaign regain momentum, but it was quickly eclipsed by the fallout over his remarks on gun rights activists. Clinton, meanwhile, has been busy courting local media in must-win states. Her national press pool, which seldom gets to question the candidate, often waits as she conducts interviews with local news outlets. She has granted few recent interviews to national outlets and rarely holds press conferences, a strategy her critics say is calculated to avoid questions about her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state, and the relationship between her familys global charity, the Clinton Foundation, and the State Department. Clinton, who has said she is one of the most transparent presidential candidates in history, has acknowledged her use of the private email server was a mistake but said she properly handled all classified information. She has denied any improper links between the foundation and the State Department. In interviews with local outlets, Clinton is more likely to face questions about job creation, public health and raising wages - all parts of her platform that she is keen to discuss. In Florida, a crucial battleground state, Republican lobbyist Gus Corbella says the contrast between the local coverage of Clintons campaign stops there and Trumps events has been stark. Clintons campaign seems to have the more disciplined approach, Corbella said. The rollout that day is on a specific event shes attending, a message shes trying to deliver. Whereas on the Trump side, its what crazy thing did he say today and the response to that. After Clintons visit last week to a tie maker in Colorado, the lead story on the front page of the Denver Post was Clinton pledges millions of jobs. Trump also featured on the front page, but in a smaller story about damage control in his troubled campaign. ",politicsNews,"August 12, 2016 ",1
California lawmaker to float zero emissions vehicle bill,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A California lawmaker next week will introduce a bill requiring 15 percent of all vehicles sold in the state to be emissions-free by 2025, her spokeswoman said on Friday. Assemblywoman Autumn Burke says the legislation is needed to ensure that Californias current zero emissions vehicle target is met with actual vehicles and not just clean car credits, which environmentalists claim have flooded the market.  Governor (Jerry) Brown has set an ambitious goal of 1.5 million electric vehicles by 2025, but unless we take action, the state wont come close to meeting this goal, said Burke, who represents the city of Inglewood in car-centric Los Angeles county.  Thats why we need to reform the rules to require that 15 percent of all cars sold in California have zero emissions by 2025. This is about clean cars, not credits, she said in a statement to Reuters. The bill will require the California Air Resources Board to adopt a regulation by the end of next year to reach the 15 percent goal.  CARB has for years operated a zero emission vehicles program, which has helped the state achieve its current level of about 200,000 ZEVs on the road. But a complex system of clean car credits, designed to give automakers flexibility in meeting the sales target, has led to a glut of credits, according to experts.  Environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council and electric car manufacturer Tesla Motors told CARB at a recent meeting that auto companies may be able to reach the states target by simply submitting credits, and said changes to the programs credit system are required. About 4 percent of vehicles sold in California are zero emissions vehicles, which include full battery electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and plug-in hybrids. The NRDC estimates that under the current rules and credit system, California would  have only 6 percent of all vehicles emission-free by 2025.   ",politicsNews,"August 12, 2016 ",1
Clinton leads Trump by five points in White House race: Reuters/Ipsos,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton led Republican Donald Trump by more than 5 percentage points in the Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll released on Friday, little changed in weeks as the U.S. presidential campaign wobbles into the heart of summer. Since July 28, Clintons daily support among likely voters in the poll has hovered between a low of 41 and a high of 44 percentage points. She was at 41 percentage points on Thursday, down slightly this week. Trumps support has moved slightly more, ranging from a low of 33 percentage points to a high of 39 points. He was at 36 points on Thursday, up slightly this week. Among registered voters, Clinton was ahead by 9 points on Thursday, 42 to 33. At this point in the 2012 election, both President Barack Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney had solidified their support, and Romney held a 45 percent to 41 percent lead, with only 14 percent of likely voters not picking one of the two candidates. Trump, a New York businessman seeking his first elected office, has been mired in controversies in recent days, and many establishment Republicans have begun to distance themselves from his campaign. He drew heavy criticism for suggesting gun rights activists could take action against Clinton, a statement he later said was meant to rally votes against her. On Thursday he repeatedly accused Clinton and Obama of being co-founders of the Islamic State militant group. On Friday he said the remarks were meant to be sarcasm. On Thursday, the number of likely voters who were not picking either Clinton or Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election was 22 percent. That number has remained stubbornly in the 20- to 25-point range for weeks. Despite that, neither of the alternative candidates is gaining traction. In a four-way race, Libertarian Gary Johnson saw his support dip slightly to 7 percentage points on Thursday, down from a high of nearly 9 points earlier this week. Green Party nominee Jill Stein was at about 3 points on Thursday, largely unchanged. The results on Thursday were taken from a sample of 1,446 registered voters and 1,116 likely voters surveyed between Aug. 7 and Aug. 11. The results have a credibility interval of plus or minus 3 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"August 12, 2016 ",1
Exclusive: Congressional leaders were briefed a year ago on hacking of Democrats - sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. intelligence officials told top congressional leaders a year ago that Russian hackers were attacking the Democratic Party, three sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday, but the lawmakers were unable to tell the targets about the hacking because the information was so secret. The disclosure of the Top Secret information would have revealed that U.S. intelligence agencies were continuing to monitor the hacking, as well as the sensitive intelligence sources and the methods they were using to do it. The material was marked with additional restrictions and assigned a unique codeword, limiting access to a small number of officials who needed to know that U.S. spy agencies had concluded that two Russian intelligence agencies or their proxies were targeting the Democratic National Committee, the central organizing body of the Democratic Party. The National Security Agency and other intelligence agencies sometimes delay informing targets of foreign intelligence activities under similar circumstances, officials have said. The alleged hacking of the Democrats and the Russian connection did not become public until late last month when the FBI said it was investigating a cyber attack at the DNC. The DNC did not respond to a request for comment for this story. The congressional briefing was given last summer in a secure room called a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, to a group of congressional leaders informally known as the Gang of Eight, the sources said. The group at the time included four Republicans: Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, and Senator Richard Burr and Representative Devin Nunes, the House and Senate intelligence committee chairs. Their Democratic counterparts were: Senator Harry Reid and Representative Nancy Pelosi, and Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Adam Schiff of the intelligence committees. AshLee Strong, press secretary for the current House Speaker, Paul Ryan, declined to comment, and Pelosis office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Pelosi on Thursday called the hacking an electronic Watergate and said the Russians were behind it. DNC officials have said they did not learn about the hacking until months after the initial congressional briefing, when an agent from an FBI cybersecurity squad asked them last fall about the partys data security arrangements. Even then, the Democratic sources said, the FBI agent never mentioned that U.S. intelligence officials suspected that Russian hackers were targeting the organization. The attack on the DNC later led the hackers to other party organizations, including the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which raises funds for House candidates, Hillary Clintons presidential campaign, and other groups. A DCCC spokeswoman declined to comment. The hackers initially used spearphishing - attacks on the private email accounts of dozens of people working for the organizations, several sources said. One of the sources said the Clinton campaign first detected attacks on its data system in early March, and was given what the source described as a general briefing about it by the FBI later that month. The source said the FBI made no mention of a Russian connection in that briefing and did not say when the penetration first took place.  According to a memo obtained by Reuters, interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile said on Thursday she was creating a Cybersecurity Advisory Board to ensure prevent future attacks and ensure that the DNCs cybersecurity capabilities are best-in-class.

"Republican Party, Trump campaign to meet in Florida","ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps campaign team is to meet officials from the Republican National Committee on Friday in what both groups described as a routine session to discuss joint operations in Florida. Trump, who is lagging Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in opinion polls, was not expected to attend the Orlando gathering after staging a rally near there on Thursday. He is to hold separate events on Friday in Erie and Altoona, Pennsylvania. The New York businessman is struggling to get past a rough several days, when he suggested gun rights activists could take action against Clinton, a statement he later said was aimed at rallying votes against her. In recent weeks, a steady stream of moderate Republicans, such as U.S. Senator Susan Collins of Maine,  have vowed not to support Trump, while 50 Republican national security experts signed a letter opposing him. Many Republicans not only worry about failing to win the White House, but also are alarmed that their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives could be at risk. Trump has blamed the U.S. news media for taking many of his comments out of context, and on Thursday night, some of his supporters heckled and cursed reporters who covered the rally in a large arena in Kissimmee. On Friday, Trump passed off as sarcasm the assertion he made repeatedly this week that President Barack Obama and Clinton were co-founders of Islamic State and its Most Valuable Players. Ratings challenged @CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) the founder of ISIS, & MVP. THEY DONT GET SARCASM? Trump said in a tweet. It was the second time in recent weeks that Trump has explained a controversial statement as sarcastic. In late July, he invited Russia to dig up tens of thousands of missing emails from Clintons time as U.S. secretary of state, which raised concerns among intelligence experts that he was urging a foreign government to spy on Americans. He said later he was being sarcastic. ",politicsNews,"August 12, 2016 ",1
"Trump calls Obama, Clinton Islamic State 'co-founders,' draws rebuke","WASHINGTON/MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump called President Barack Obama and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton the co-founders of Islamic State, ratcheting up his assertion that they are responsible for the rise of the militant group and sparking renewed criticism of his leadership ability. Clintons White House campaign on Thursday called the remarks a false claim, in Clintons latest response to a series of attacks by Trump in which he has sought to portray America as less safe, blaming Democrats and depicting himself as the only one who can restore security. Democrats, in turn, have used Trumps often hyperbolic statements ahead of the Nov. 8 election to argue that he is unfit to be president and lacks the temperament to be trusted with matters of national security. This is another example of Donald Trump trash-talking the United States, Clinton senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement. Whats remarkable about Trumps comments is that once again hes echoing the talking points of Putin and our adversaries to attack American leaders and American interests, while failing to offer any serious plans to confront terrorism or make this country more secure, Sullivan said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. For Republicans uncertain about whether Trump has the discipline to maintain focus for his campaign, the latest comments were concerning. Many see the New York real estate mogul as spending too much time fighting within his own party and have called on him to refocus his campaign message on Clinton.  ISIS is a solid GOP message to show contrast with Hillary Clinton and the failures of the Obama-Clinton administration, said Alice Stewart, a Republican strategist who remains undecided about the nominee, using acronyms for Islamic State and the Republican Party.  Even so, she added, Trump should have simply said that the Obama administrations decision to pull all troops out of Iraq, with no stay-behind agreement, created a vacuum and allowed ISIS to metastasize. Its absurd for him to say that Obama and Clinton are founders of ISIS  - and he cant blame the media for this. A group of about 70 Republicans, including five former members of Congress, called on the Republican National Committee to stop helping Trump in the wake of his recent remarks and instead focus on getting members of Congress re-elected. Trumps divisive and dangerous actions are not only a threat to our other candidates, but to our party and the nation, the letter stated. In response, Trump said he would stop raising money for the Republican Party if it ends its help for his campaign. If they want to do that they can save me a lot of time and a lot of energy, he told Fox News. Im the one raising the money for them. Some Republicans see a small silver lining in Trump talking more about Clinton. It is helpful  at least to the rest of the ticket  that he is focusing a little more on Clinton than on other Republicans, whether defeated primary opponents or other elected officials who are on the ballot, for a change, said former New Hampshire Republican Chairman Fergus Cullen, who is not supporting Trump.  But tomorrow, or later today, he could blame (Republican Senator) Jeff Flake for A-Rods retirement, Cullen said, referring to Yankees player Alex Rodriguezs decision to leave professional baseball. I have zero confidence in Trumps ability to stay on one message or to drive one message for any length of time longer than about 10 seconds.     Trump has previously criticized Clinton for supporting the Iraq War in 2003 while she was a U.S. senator. Trump frequently says, to contrast himself with Clinton, that he opposed the war - but in interviews before the invasion he did voice support. Now, Trump is arguing that in trying to end the war and withdrawing U.S. troops in 2011, Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time, and Obama created Islamic State.  Republicans frequently trace the birth of Islamic State to the Obama administrations decision to withdraw the last U.S. forces from Iraq by the end of 2011.  But many analysts argue its roots lie in the decision of George W. Bushs Republican administration to invade Iraq in 2003 without a plan to fill the vacuum created by Saddam Husseins ouster. It was Bushs administration, not Obamas, that negotiated the 2009 agreement that called for the withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Iraq by Dec. 31, 2011. Clinton posted on Twitter that Trumps comments are disqualifying. Anyone willing to sink so low, so often should never be allowed to serve as our commander-in-chief, she wrote. The White House declined to comment on Trumps claim. Appearing in Miami Beach, Florida, on Thursday morning, Trump repeated his attack for the third time, saying the U.S. government has unleashed ISIS.  In fact, I think well give Hillary Clinton ... most valuable player, Trump said. ISIS will hand her the most valuable player award. Her only competition is President Barack Obama.     Trump first made the assertion in a speech on Wednesday night in Florida, saying, I call them co-founders of Islamic State.  In an interview on Thursday morning, Trump defended the remarks. Is there something wrong with saying that? Trump told CNBC. Why - are people complaining that I said he was the founder of ISIS? All I do is tell the truth, Im a truth teller. Trump was also asked by radio host Hugh Hewitt if he meant that (Obama) created the vacuum, he lost the peace. No, Trump responded. I meant hes the founder of ISIS. I do.  The Democratic National Committee lambasted Trumps remarks. Donald Trump should apologize for his outrageous, unhinged and patently false suggestions on the founding of ISIS, the DNC said in a statement. This is yet another out of control statement by a candidate who is unraveling before our very eyes.  Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani defended Trump on CNN, saying his remarks were legitimate political commentary.   ",politicsNews,"August 11, 2016 ",1
"Clinton disparages Trump's economic plan, vows to help workers","WARREN, Mich. (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Thursday said rival Donald Trump had no real plans to help middle-class families, arguing that his agenda of tax cuts and tough trade talk would throw the economy into recession. Hesoffered no credible plans to address what working families are up against today, Clinton said in Warren, Michigan, shortly after touring Futuramic, a hangar-like, high-tech factory that makes parts for the aerospace industry. Clinton said Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, would scrap regulations meant to hold corporations accountable, cut taxes on millionaires and Wall Street money managers, and eliminate the estate tax, an inheritance tax that generally hits the wealthy. Clinton offered no new proposals of her own but sought to cast doubt on the image Trump promotes of himself as the voice for working people. The New York businessman is counting on his appeal to blue-collar voters with concerns about global trade to boost his chances in key states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio. Clinton on Thursday ran through many of the policies she has outlined over the last year to contrast herself with Trump, who has given far fewer details about his plans, as the presidential campaign heads toward the Nov. 8 election. Speaking to Fox News later on Thursday, Trump said he would cut business taxes to bring jobs back to the United States, while Clinton would have to double taxes to meet the increased spending on social programs in her plan. Trump delivered an economic speech in Detroit on Monday. He publicly named his economic advisers last week, which Clinton mocked as six guys named Steve. On Thursday, he released a list of nine additions to the council, eight of whom were women. New members included roofing billionaire Diane Hendricks, investor Carla Sands and hedge funder Anthony Scaramucci. Workers anxiety over trade deals has become a central theme in the 2016 election, and Clinton rejected the portrait Trump has painted that she only pretends not to favor the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal she praised when she was secretary of state from 2009-2013 but has more recently opposed. Clinton also says she would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was signed by former President Bill Clinton, her husband. Trump routinely disparages the agreement as bad for American jobs.  Its true that too often past trade deals have been sold to the American people with rosy scenarios that didnt pan out, Clinton told the crowd of factory workers. The answer is not to rant and rave, or cut ourselves off from the world. The answer is to finally make trade work for us, not against us, she said. So my message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

"Ex-Trump staffer sues campaign, alleges gun incident in North Carolina","(Reuters) - A former North Carolina staffer is suing Donald Trumps presidential campaign, saying a top employee in the state working on the Republicans White House bid once pulled a gun on him and that after he reported it, the campaign took no action. Vincent Bordini, who said he was hired in December 2015 as a software trainer, said Earl Phillip, then Trumps North Carolina state director, pointed a pistol at his kneecap while the two were in a car together in February, according to a lawsuit dated Wednesday and filed in state court. Bordini said he reported the incident to several Trump campaign officials, including then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, with no result, according to the lawsuit, which was posted online by the New York Daily News. The lawsuit names Phillip and the Trump campaign as defendants. Vincent was a passionate Donald J. Trump supporter, the lawsuit said. He had faith that the Trump campaign would handle the situation internally. But as time went on it became apparent  that this not going to happen. William Harding, a Charlotte-based lawyer for Phillip, called the allegations preposterous and said if Bordinis claims were true, there would have been criminal action. If someone brandished a weapon on me or assaults me, Im going to go to the appropriate law enforcement officer, Harding said. Phillip was replaced earlier this month as state director and moved to a diversity coalition for Trump. On Thursday, he resigned from the campaign, Harding said. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. An attorney for Bordini also did not immediately respond. The lawsuit said the gun incident occurred during a trip to South Carolina ahead of that states primary. Bordini said four other people had similar interactions with Phillip, but the campaign did nothing in response, the lawsuit said. ",politicsNews,"August 11, 2016 ",1
Trump adviser joined key party meeting on Ukraine,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A foreign policy adviser to U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump confirmed his attendance at a meeting last month during which the Republican Party agreed to watered-down language in its support of Ukraine. J. D. Gordon, the adviser who previously served as a Pentagon spokesman, said that while he was present during the meeting at the Republican National Convention, he sat at a side table with staff and was not among the delegates charged with shaping the Ukraine platform. But one delegate in attendance, Diana Denman, said Gordon told her he was going to speak with Trump during the debate over the platforms language on Ukraine, saying she believed Trumps campaign played a direct role in softening the partys support for Ukraine at a time of heightened tensions with Russia. The Trump campaign has denied it played any role in the weakening of the partys position regarding Ukraine. Gordon called Denmans version of events inaccurate.  Stephen Yates, co-chair of the national security subcommittee, confirmed that Trump campaign members were present at the meeting where Ukraine language for the RNC platform was discussed. But he said only delegates participated in the debate and denied the Trump campaign played any role in softening the Ukraine language. The details of the meeting in Cleveland have attracted scrutiny and raised questions about the Trump campaigns stance toward Russia. Trump has said he would seek to build a closer relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, praising him as a stronger leader than U.S. President Barack Obama. In the last month, Trump has also suggested he might not defend NATO allies if they did not spend more on defense, appeared to invite Russia to hack the emails of Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton and suggested he might accept Russias 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Denman, a member of the platform committees national security subcommittee, said she proposed language that supported providing lethal defensive weapons to Ukraines armed forces and greater coordination with NATO on defense planning. That phrase was eventually changed to remove the reference to lethal defensive weapons. In the end, the platform, which serves as a largely symbolic statement of the partys priorities, criticizes the Obama administration for encouraging a resurgent Russia and supports continued sanctions on Moscow and appropriate assistance to the armed forces of the Ukraine without specifying what that would involve. Yates said Denman could have reintroduced the amendment in the full committee meeting if she felt strong-armed in subcommittee. I dont have particular sympathy for delegates who chose not to avail themselves of the opportunity in full committee, and then start spinning yarn about how this came about, he said. Denman said she stands by her account. Russia on Thursday announced it would conduct war games in the Black Sea, a day after Putin accused Ukraine of trying to provoke a conflict over Crimea.

Trump settles legal dispute with former campaign aide,"(Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps campaign has settled a legal dispute with former aide Sam Nunberg, according to a court document filed in New York on Thursday. Trump had sought $10 million in damages from Nunberg in arbitration proceedings. Trump accused Nunberg, who was fired in 2015, of violating a confidentiality agreement. The one-page filing with a New York state court did not give the terms of the settlement. Nunbergs attorney, Andrew Miltenberg, said the matter was amicably resolved but he declined to comment further. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nunberg said in court filings in July that Trump accused him of being the source for a New York Post story in May that recounted a public argument between Corey Lewandowski, who was then the campaign manager, and Hope Hicks, Trumps spokeswoman. In the affidavit, Nunberg said the argument was part of a sordid and apparently illicit affair between the two. He denied being the source for the New York Post story. Lewandowski was fired by the campaign in June, a move apparently unrelated to the Post story.  A Trump Organization lawyer, Alan Garten, last month called Nunbergs allegations categorically untrue. The Trump campaign fired Nunberg in August 2015 after the discovery of Facebook posts that critics deemed racist. Nunberg has denied he wrote the posts. ",politicsNews,"August 11, 2016 ",1
U.S. government shifts $81 million to Zika vaccine research,"CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has shifted $81 million in funds from other projects to continue work on developing vaccines to fight Zika in the absence of any funding from U.S. lawmakers. In a letter addressed to Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat and minority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said she was allocating $34 million in funding to the National Institutes of Health and $47 million to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to work on Zika vaccines. Burwell said the funding was intended to keep Zika vaccine research going despite the lack of funding from U.S. lawmakers, who left for summer recess before allocating any funding to Zika research and preparedness. The mosquito-borne Zika virus has spread to more than 50 countries and territories since the outbreak began last year in Brazil. On Thursday, Governor Rick Scott said state health officials have identified three additional people in the affected area with locally transmitted Zika, bringing the total to 25. The Obama administration in February requested $1.9 billion to fight Zika, but congressional lawmakers have been considering a much smaller sum. A bill providing $1.1 billion was blocked by Democrats after Republicans attached language to stop abortion-provider Planned Parenthood from using that government funding for healthcare services, mainly in U.S. territories like Puerto Rico. The Republican legislation also would siphon off unused money under President Barack Obamas signature 2010 healthcare law to combat Zika. In addition, Democrats balked at a Republican provision that they said would gut clean water protections. The new bolus of funds from HHS comes on top of the $589 million in repurposed funds previously allocated for Ebola efforts. HHS has said these funds will run out at the end of August. At a press briefing in Washington, Dr. Anthony Fauci,  director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he needs $33 million to prepare to move the first potential Zika vaccine to the second phase of human clinical trials. The first phase of that testing is expected to end in late November or December. Fauci said the health secretary has the authority to transfer 1 percent of NIHs $33 billion budget per year from one Institute to the other. He said the director of the NIH, Dr. Francis Collins, will decide which existing programs the funds will be drawn from. He will probably do it on a prorated basis across the Institutes, he said. Fauci said the budget transfer will not fill the longer-term NIH funding needs to fight the virus and to develop a second or third potential vaccine candidate. Drugs frequently fail to realize the promise they show in early trials. We still need about $196 million more, he said. Fauci said the health secretarys action was essentially one of desperation given the failure of Congress to authorize additional funding. Taking money from other research programs is extremely damaging to the biomedical research enterprise, he said. Were taking money away from cancer, diabetes, all those things. Dr. LaMar Hasbrouck, executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, said at the briefing that local health authorities are similarly siphoning off money from other programs. Were robbing Peter to pay Paul, he said.  In her letter, Burwell said the $47 million in funding for BARDA will allow the agency to enter into contracts with key partners to develop vaccines. But, she said BARDA will need an   estimated $342 million in additional funding to continue its work with outside partners in the development of vaccines, diagnostics and pathogen inactivation technology used to protect the U.S. blood supply.

Factbox: Why the Zika virus is causing alarm,"Global health officials are racing to better understand the Zika virus behind a major outbreak that began in Brazil last year and has spread to many countries in the Americas.  The following are some questions and answers about the virus and current outbreak: How do people become infected? Zika is transmitted to people through the bite of infected female mosquitoes, primarily the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same type that spreads dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said Aedes mosquitoes are found in all countries in the Americas except Canada and continental Chile, and the virus will likely reach all countries and territories of the region where Aedes mosquitoes are found. How do you treat Zika? There is no treatment or vaccine for Zika infection. Companies and scientists are racing to develop a safe and effective vaccine for Zika, but the World Health Organization (WHO) had said early in 2016 that it would take at least 18 months to start large-scale clinical trials of potential preventative shots. A vaccine is not expected to be ready for widespread use for at least two or three years. U.S. government researchers said they started their first clinical trial of a Zika vaccine. How dangerous is it? The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that infection with the Zika virus in pregnant women is a cause of the birth defect microcephaly and other severe brain abnormalities in babies. The CDC said now that the causal relationship has been established, several important questions must still be answered with studies that could take years. According to the World Health Organization, there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can cause the birth defect microcephaly in babies, a condition defined by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems. In addition, the agency said it could cause Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis. Conclusive proof of the damage caused by Zika may take months or years. Brazil reports the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly at more than 1,700 as doctors and Brazilian health officials find that some suspected cases of microcephaly are not the disorder. Suspected ones under investigation had declined to 3,257. Brazil registered 91,387 likely cases of the Zika virus from February until April 2. Current research in Brazil indicates the greatest microcephaly risk is associated with infection during the first trimester of pregnancy, but health officials have warned an impact could be seen in later weeks. Recent studies have shown evidence of Zika in amniotic fluid, placenta and fetal brain tissue. What are the symptoms of Zika infection?     People infected with Zika may have a mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain and fatigue that can last for two to seven days. But as many as 80 percent of people infected never develop symptoms. The symptoms are similar to those of dengue or chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same type of mosquito. How can Zika be contained? Efforts to control the spread of the virus focus on eliminating mosquito breeding sites and taking precautions against mosquito bites such as using insect repellent and mosquito nets. U.S. and international health officials have advised pregnant women to avoid travel to Latin American and Caribbean countries where they may be exposed to Zika. How widespread is the outbreak? Active Zika outbreaks have been reported in at least 54 countries or territories, most of them in the Americas, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Brazil has been the country most affected. (1.usa.gov/1ovAJyh) Africa (1): Cape Verde  Americas (45): Anguilla, Antigua, Argentina, Aruba, Barbados, Barbuda, Belize, Bolivia, Bonaire, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Curaao, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Saba, Puerto Rico, Saint Barthelmy, Saint Lucia, Saint Martin, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Eustatius, St. Maarten, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Cacos, U.S. Virgin Islands and Venezuela. Oceania/Pacific Islands (8): American Samoa, Fiji, Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Tonga.  What is the history of the Zika virus? The Zika virus is found in tropical locales with large mosquito populations. Outbreaks of Zika have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Southern Asia and the Western Pacific. The virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys and was first identified in people in 1952 in Uganda and Tanzania, according to the WHO.  Can Zika be transmitted through sexual contact? The World Health Organization (WHO) said sexual transmission is relatively common and has advised pregnant women not to travel to areas with ongoing outbreaks of Zika virus. It also  advised women living in areas where the virus is being transmitted to delay getting pregnant. The U.S. CDC is investigating about a dozen cases of possible sexual transmission. Those cases involved possible transmission of the virus from men to their sex partners. But the CDC issued updated recommendations for preventing and testing for Zika infection on July 25, warning that the virus can be transmitted through unprotected sex with an infected female partner. A reported case of female-to-male sexual transmission in New York City, and limited human and non-human primate data indicating that Zika virus RNA can be detected in vaginal secretions, led to the new warning, the agency said. CDCs expanded warnings on sexual exposure to Zika now  caution against sex without a condom or other barrier method of protection with any person, male or female, who has traveled to or lives in an area with Zika, including female to female transmission with a pregnant partner. British health officials reported Zika was found in a mans semen two months after he was infected, suggesting the virus may linger in semen long after infection symptoms fade. The PAHO said Zika can be transmitted through blood, but this is an infrequent transmission mechanism. There is no evidence Zika can be transmitted to babies through breast milk. The WHO has identified Zika cases in Argentina, Chile, France, Italy and New Zealand as likely caused by sexual transmission.  What other complications are associated with Zika? Zika has also been associated with other neurological disorders, including serious brain and spinal cord infections. The long-term health consequences of Zika infection are unclear. Other uncertainties surround the incubation period of the virus and how Zika interacts with other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue. ",politicsNews,"August 11, 2016 ",1

Trump acknowledges tough fight in usually Republican Utah,"ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump acknowledged on Thursday that his campaign was struggling in Utah, a usually rock-solid Republican state, on a day in which he briefly set aside his self-confidence for a rare display of doubt.  Trump made the comment in urging conservative Christian evangelicals to organize support for him in several key states where the Nov. 8 election is likely to be decided, such as Ohio, Florida and Virginia. The wealthy New York businessman has suffered a number of self-inflicted wounds in recent days that have given the advantage in the campaign to Democrat Hillary Clinton. Were having a tremendous problem in Utah, Trump told a conference room filled with evangelical pastors, blaming a false narrative that has been built up around his candidacy. He has repeatedly blamed the news media for dishonest tactics. A SurveyUSA opinion poll conducted for the Salt Lake Tribune in June showed Clinton and Trump tied. Other polls have given Trump a lead but not the type of advantage that previous Republican nominees have enjoyed in the state. The normally confident Trump never apologizes and is loathe to admit that he might face difficulties. But in talking to the National Association of Home Builders earlier in Miami Beach, Trump admitted his past years before he became a politician could be causing him problems now. If I had planned for it, I wouldnt have had such a rocky path, he said. I wouldnt have spoken to Howard so much. That was a reference to his many appearances on the Howard Stern Show radio program. He has been estimated to have appeared on the show more than two dozen times over 20 years, and the conversation frequently turned ribald.  Trump, who is trailing Clinton in Virginia, a formerly Republican state that Democratic President Barack Obama won in 2008 and 2012, urged evangelicals to help him in that state as well. In doing so, Trump pledged to rewrite the so-called Johnson Amendment, the 1954 change in the U.S. tax code that prohibits church leaders from using the pulpit for political purposes. If we get those people to vote, were going to win in Virginia, he said. If they dont vote, its not going to happen. Trump also said we need help in Ohio, the state where he held his Republican National Convention last month. Ohio Governor John Kasich, who lost to Trump in the Republican primary race, has refused to endorse Trump. Were very close in Ohio, but we need help, Trump said. Trump has seen a steady stream of moderate Republicans vow not to support him, such as U.S. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, and 50 Republican national security experts signed a letter opposing him.  All this is evidence of fissures in the party over the bellicose rhetoric and positions of Trump, who on Wednesday called Obama the founder of ISIS, the acronym for Islamic State, and Clinton the co-founder. Trump joked that winning the White House and doing a good job as president might be his only way to salvation. So go out and spread the words and once I get in, I will do the thing that I do very well, said Trump with a smile. I figure its probably maybe the only way Im going to get to heaven, so I better do a good job. ",politicsNews,"August 11, 2016 ",1
Clinton would stick with Garland as nominee for Supreme Court: Reid,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said on Thursday he believed Hillary Clinton would stick with President Barack Obamas Supreme Court nominee if she won the Nov. 8 presidential election. Some Republican conservatives were concerned that if Democratic presidential candidate Clinton won the White House, she would pick a more liberal judge than Obamas nominee,  Merrick Garland, for a lifetime appointment to the high court. Garland is a centrist federal appeals court judge whom a number of Republicans have praised. I would think that she and all the people around her would say, Why do we need to rock the boat here? Lets get him confirmed quickly and move on to the next one, whenever that comes, Reid said on a conference call with reporters. Clinton has urged the Senate to confirm Garland. Her  campaign did not immediately return a request for comment on Reids remarks. Senate Democrats may try to force a vote on procedural motions that, if successful, would lead to a vote on Garland before the new president takes office in January, Reid said. He invited along Republicans who want to distance themselves from their partys controversial presidential candidate, Donald Trump. We have a couple of options and we are deciding when to do that. And if we should do that. When and if, Reid said. The leader of the Republican-controlled Senate, Mitch McConnell, has refused to schedule hearings on the nomination of Garland, saying the winner of the Nov. 8 presidential election should choose the Supreme Court justice. Obama nominated Garland on March 16 to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13. The majority leader has been clear: the next president will make the nomination for this vacancy, Don Stewart, deputy chief of staff for McConnell, said in an email. A number of Republican senators in tough re-election fights are trying to distance themselves from their partys controversial nominee, yet they refuse to hold a vote on Garland, Reid said.  He said those Republicans should call on McConnell to confirm Garland, not hold the Supreme Court seat for someone as radical and unfit as Trump, a New York businessman who has never held public office. They spend a lot of time these Republicans, spending a lot of energy trying to separate themselves from Donald Trump. But as long as theyre holding a Supreme Court seat open for him, theyre his minions. Theyre his enablers, Reid said.   ",politicsNews,"August 11, 2016 ",1
"Clinton to release 2015 tax returns within days, criticizes Trump","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will release her 2015 tax returns and her running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, will release the last 10 years of their tax returns within days, according to a source close to Clinton. The returns will show Clinton paid an effective tax rate of 35 percent and gave about 10 percent to charity, CNBC reported. The release comes as Republican Donald Trump is facing criticism for not releasing his tax returns - a political practice that is not required by law but has been done by every White House nominee since 1973. He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns, Clinton said on Thursday in an economic speech in Michigan.   Clintons campaign has already released tax returns going back to 2007. In addition, tax returns are publicly available for the eight years her husband, former President Bill Clinton, was in the White House. Prior years were released by his campaign. Tax returns filed by the Clintons have been made public, in some form, for every year back to 1977. Trump, a New York businessman, has refused to release his tax returns, saying they are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. He has said he is unlikely to do so before the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have blasted Trump for failing to disclose his tax rate and raised questions about what his returns say about his net worth and various business ties, particularly in Russia.     Asked in a television interview in May what tax rate he pays, Trump replied Its none of your business. The IRS has said Trump can release his tax returns even while under audit. Besides showing sources and amounts of income, tax returns show what percentage tax rate a person ultimately pays, as well as how much they claimed in deductions and the amounts given to charities.   Earlier this month, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, billionaire investor Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to make his returns public. Im under audit, too, and I would be delighted to meet him anyplace, anytime, before the election, Buffett said. Ill bring my tax return, he can bring his tax return ... and let people ask us questions. Trump has declined to do so.  ",politicsNews,"August 11, 2016 ",1
U.S. House Democrats' Pelosi: administration may shift funds for Zika,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said the Obama administration may announce as early as Thursday that it is shifting more money into fighting the Zika virus. Maybe today or tomorrow, Pelosi told reporters in a hallway on Thursday. She did not give an amount, but said, I think they are going to try to do it a piece at a time, hoping that something else will happen, an apparent reference to the administrations request that the Republican-led Congress approve a funding bill to combat the virus. The Obama administration in February requested $1.9 billion to fight the virus, which was first detected in Brazil last year and has spread rapidly in the Americas. Before going home on summer recess, lawmakers were discussing a $1.1 billion measure, but the bill stalled amid partisan bickering. House Democrats at a news conference urged the Republicans to reconvene Congress to address the virus. Florida is grappling with at least 21 cases of locally transmitted Zika, and the Obama administration has already reprogrammed nearly $600 million to fight the virus. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will spend all of its remaining funds by the end of September, while two other agencies will exhaust their resources for Zika by the end of August, Representative Rosa DeLauro said. Money will have to be shifted from biomedical research to fight Zika, DeLauro said. If they dont, vaccine development will be stopped dead in its tracks, she said. ",politicsNews,"August 11, 2016 ",1
Clinton campaign calls Trump ISIS attack 'false claim',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In response to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps accusation that Democrat President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton were co-founders of Islamic State, Clintons campaign called the remarks a false claim.  This is another example of Donald Trump trash-talking the United States, senior policy advisor Jake Sullivan said in a statement. Whats remarkable about Trumps comments is that once again, hes echoing the talking points of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and our adversaries to attack American leaders and American interests, while failing to offer any serious plans to confront terrorism or make this country more secure.

U.S. House Democratic leader blames Russians for 'electronic Watergate',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday said the recent cyber attack on Democratic politicians was broad and that Russians were clearly behind the breach, adding that the damage was still being investigated. It is the Russians, Pelosi told reporters at a news conference, referring to the recent breach affecting the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.  Pelosi called the attack, made public last month, an electronic Watergate akin to the 1972 burglary at Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate office that upended the Nixon presidency. This is a break-in. Pelosis comments come on the heels of a New York Times report on Thursday that the cyber attack targeting Democrats was wider than first thought, with more than 100 party officials and groups were affected. The Democratic National Committee and U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintons campaign was also affected. Asked if she was personally targeted, Pelosi said she did not know. We are assessing the damage, Pelosi told reporters, adding that she could not speak to the impact on any Democratic governors. The Obama administration has not publicly named Russia as behind the attack, but investigators have concluded the attackers were directed by the GRU, Russias military intelligence service, and the FSB, the civilian espionage agency. Clinton has also pointed to Moscow. Russia has denied involvement in the breach. A U.S. official familiar with the investigation said no evidence has been found so far that indicates the hackers got into Clintons personal server or any classified systems, but their footprints suggest they paid special attention to accounts they thought might lead them to information of national security interest. The official said the hackers apparently proceeded beyond the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton campaign, and the Democrats House of Representatives campaign committee to individual email accounts and probably other Democratic groups and individuals who emailed people using the accounts they first hacked. The pattern fits what has come to be standard hacking practice, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation by government as well as private agencies. You go as far as you can, hoping you find something useful. ",politicsNews,"August 11, 2016 ",1
"Clinton blasts Trump for 'casual inciting of violence,' Republicans shaken","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Wednesday accused Republican opponent Donald Trump of inciting violence with his call for gun rights activists to stop her from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices. Clintons comments added to a growing outcry over Trumps remarks on Tuesday at a North Carolina rally, which some interpreted as a call for violence against his White House rival. His remarks also fueled widespread concerns about his ability to stay on track. Words matter, my friends, the former U.S. secretary of state, who rarely engages in direct back-and-forths with her Republican rival, said at a rally in Des Moines, Iowa. And if you are running to be president or you are president of the United States, words can have tremendous consequences. Yesterday, we witnessed the latest in a long line of casual comments from Donald Trump that crossed the line, she said, citing his casual inciting of violence. Trump insisted in an interview with Fox News that his remarks were a call for political, not physical, action. There is tremendous political power to save the Second Amendment, tremendous, the New York businessman said. And you look at the power they have in terms of votes and thats what I was referring to, obviously thats what I was referring to, and everybody knows it. The U.S. Constitutions Second Amendment guarantees a right to keep and bear arms. I cant think of anything remotely comparable to it. No one tells a joke about the opponent getting shot. Ive never heard it, said Bob Shrum, a top aide for Al Gores presidential campaign in 2000 and John Kerrys in 2004. High-profile Republicans and rank-and-file voters appeared shaken on Wednesday after a string of Trump misfires, struggling with how to best reject his divisive candidacy. Some pledged to withhold their endorsement and others backed Clinton.  Some, including MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman from Florida, called for party leaders to replace Trump on the ticket. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll taken Aug. 5-8 - before Trumps latest controversy - showed that nearly one-fifth of 396 registered Republicans said they want Trump to drop out of the race and another 10 percent said they dont know whether the Republican nominee should or not. Clintons campaign, seeing an opening, has moved to bring disenchanted Republicans into the fold by announcing an official intraparty outreach effort on behalf of the Democratic nominee. Clintons campaign now has a website for Republicans and political independents to sign up to pledge their support, listing 50 prominent Republicans and independents who have endorsed her. On Monday, 50 Republican national security officials signed an open letter questioning Trumps temperament, calling him reckless and unqualified to be president.     Other top Republicans, including Senator Susan Collins of Maine this week, have disavowed Trump but said they cannot back Clinton. James Rohrscheib, 74, a registered Republican and retired U.S. Navy officer from Washington state, told Reuters the reality is the Nov. 8 election will be a tough one. Im in a quandary as to who I am going to vote for, Rohrscheib said. Trump has dismissed the defections and criticism as an unsurprising reaction of the so-called Washington elite to his drive to change the status quo. One group that appears unswayed is Trumps donors. Reuters interviewed nine major Trump donors on Wednesday, and not one said his Second Amendment comment had given them pause. Trump Texas fundraising co-chair Gaylord Hughey called the interpretation of his remark as condoning violence ridiculous and ludicrous. Its just another issue the press has really twisted to make headlines, Hughey said. But Mike Smith, a Republican voter and Reuters/Ipsos poll respondent, said the support Trump is still receiving from Republicans almost seems obligatory rather than voluntary. Im almost at the point where I think Im going to vote for Hillary. I dont like her, said Smith, a 74-year-old retiree who lives in Clearwater, Florida. But Mr. Trump is making me very nervous. Republican strategist and Trump supporter Ford OConnell said Trump has dug himself a deep hole with voters and to win the election he will need to make it a referendum on Hillary Clinton and the rigged system. Trump sought to do just that by using an economic policy speech in Detroit on Monday to correct a series of missteps that included a prolonged clash with the parents of a fallen Muslim American soldier. But his remarks Tuesday undermined that effort. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks, Trump said at the rally in North Carolina. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I dont know, he continued. A federal official familiar with the matter denied a media report that the U.S. Secret Service, which investigates threats against presidents and candidates, had formally spoken with the Trump campaign about his remark. Trumps comment and the resulting backlash occurred as Reuters/Ipsos polling showed some 44 percent of 1,162 registered voters believe Trump should exit the race, and that as of Tuesday, Clinton led Trump by more than 7 percentage points, up from a 3-point lead late last week. Strategists and Trump detractors agreed that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to remove Trump from the Republican ticket. Its wishful thinking to believe the Republicans are going to replace its nominee after the convention. People are grasping at straws, Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist unaffiliated with Trump, told Reuters. A more likely scenario would be a replay of the 1996 presidential race, when the Republican Party essentially deserted nominee Bob Dole, who was badly trailing President Bill Clinton, to focus on congressional races.

Trump seeks to raise fresh ethical questions about Clinton,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday tried to raise ethical questions about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and criticized her for letting the father of the Orlando nightclub shooter sit behind her at a rally. At campaign events in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and earlier in Abingdon, Virginia, Trump sought to rally his campaign after a setback on Tuesday when he appeared to suggest gun rights activists should take action against Clinton. On Wednesday he drew attention to the emergence of emails from Clintons use of a private server when she was secretary of state during President Barack Obamas first term, from 2009-2013. A conservative watchdog group, Judicial Watch, obtained the release through court order of 44 email exchanges that it said were not previously turned over to the State Department. Among them was a 2009 email in which Doug Band, a former official at the Clinton Foundation charity run by former President Bill Clinton, directed two Hillary Clinton aides to put Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire and Clinton Foundation donor Gilbert Chagoury in touch with a State Department official dealing with Lebanon. The Clinton campaign has dismissed the new emails as having nothing to do with Clinton or the foundations work. Trump, who is trailing in many polls with three months to go until the Nov. 8 election, said the new batch of emails suggested a pay for play scheme. Youre not allowed to do it, he said. Its illegal. Trump also called Obama the founder of ISIS for not leaving U.S. forces in Iraq and said that made Clinton the co-founder. In addition, he had sharp comments about the seating of Seddique Mateen, the father of Omar Mateen, who shot to death 49 people at an Orlando nightclub in June, behind Clinton at a rally in Kissimee, Florida. Wasnt it terrible when the father of the animal who killed the wonderful people was sitting with a big smile on his face right behind Hillary Clinton? he said. Trump said he believed that people who sit behind the candidate at rallies are close to the campaign. Reporters noticed that sitting behind Trump at the event in Fort Lauderdale was former U.S. Representative Mark Foley, who resigned from Congress in 2006 after allegations surfaced that he had sent suggestive emails and sexually explicit instant messages to teenage boys who had been congressional pages. Foley told the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel he has been a long-time friend of Trumps and has found him to be a different breed of leader and a different breed of candidate.   Trump sharply criticized the news media for the way it handled a comment he made in Wilmington, North Carolina, on Tuesday suggesting gun rights supporters could take action against Clinton. I would actually say that the media is almost as crooked as crooked Hillary Clinton, Trump said. He drew harsh criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike because some took his remarks on Tuesday to mean he was inciting violence despite Trumps insistence he was only urging more people to rally votes against Clinton.

Official: No formal Secret Service discussions with Trump camp on remark,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal official on Wednesday said the U.S. Secret Service had not formally spoken with Republican Donald Trumps presidential campaign regarding his suggestion a day earlier that gun rights activists could stop Democratic rival Hillary Clinton from curtailing their access to firearms. Following Trumps comment at a rally on Tuesday in which he suggested that gun rights activists could stop Clinton from appointing liberal anti-gun justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, a federal official familiar with the matter told Reuters that there had been no formal conversations between the Secret Service and the Trump campaign. Earlier CNN had reported that there had been multiple conversations between the campaign and the agency. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks, Trump told a North Carolina campaign rally on Tuesday. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I dont know, he added, leading some critics to believe Trump was referring to gun violence against his rival.  The controversy came as the campaign tried to stay on message after a contentious previous week. Trump weathered criticism within his own party for delaying endorsements of fellow Republicans and for a prolonged clash with the family of a fallen Muslim American U.S. Army captain.  The campaign denied that inciting violence had been the intent of Tuesdays remark, and on Wednesday said there had been no conversations with the Secret Service about it.  No such meeting or conversation ever happened, Trump wrote on Twitter, accusing CNN of having made up the report.  ",politicsNews,"August 10, 2016 ",1
One-in-five U.S. Republicans want Trump to drop out: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nearly one-fifth of registered Republicans want Donald Trump to drop out of the race for the White House, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday, reflecting the turmoil his candidacy has sown within his party. Some 19 percent think the New York real estate magnate should drop out, 70 percent think he should stay in and 10 percent say they dont know, according to the Aug. 5-8 poll of 396 registered Republicans. The poll has a confidence interval of six percentage points. Among all registered voters, some 44 percent want Trump to drop out. That is based on a survey of 1,162 registered voters, with a confidence interval of 3 percentage points. That is 9 points higher than his support for the presidency in the latest Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll.  The figures underscored deep divisions within the Republican Party over Trumps candidacy. A number of prominent Republicans have declined to endorse him in the Nov. 8 election against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, citing his fiery rhetoric and  policy proposals such as building a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border and temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country. Mike Smith, a 74-year-old retiree from Clearwater, Florida, said he supported Trump for much longer than he should have, but now feels the candidate should drop out of the race. Trump has not comported himself as a leader, said Smith, adding that he might vote for Clinton over his partys nominee. His policies dont seem to be well formed, they dont seem to make any sense, Smith said. The support he has from Republicans almost seems obligatory rather than voluntary. Trump found himself embroiled in yet another controversy on Tuesday after saying at a rally that gun rights activists could act to stop Clinton from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices - a comment his campaign said was misinterpreted, but that Clintons campaign called dangerous. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks, Trump said at the rally at the University of North Carolina. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I dont know, he continued. The U.S. Constitutions Second Amendment guarantees a right to keep and bear arms. Megan MacDonald, 25, is a Republican but did not support Trump through the primary. He has not done anything since to change her mind, and believes he should leave the race.  I just feel there are so many derogatory things that have come out of his mouth, and hes putting it out there  its not like someone is finding skeletons in his closet, said MacDonald, a stay-at-home mom in Louisiana, who may pick a third-party candidate. It feels like hes not even trying to be a decent person who we should look up to. Trump had previously stirred criticism for engaging in a spat with the parents of a Muslim U.S. soldier killed in Iraq.  In addition, 50 prominent national security experts signed an open letter saying they would not vote for Trump in the fall, saying he lacks the character, values, and experience to be president. Trump dismissed the group as part of the Washington establishment that he blames for many of the United States problems. Stacie McDaniel, 42, said Trumps rhetoric has, at times, made her think he should drop out of the race.  Sometimes I think he has good intentions, but his mouth gets overloaded, said McDaniel, a relocation director for a real estate company in Louisiana. I think he says things that if he does get elected, hes not going to get anything done. Still, she plans to vote for Trump, she said, because she cannot bring herself to support Clinton. I dislike Hillary so much, she said. As the lesser of two evils is why Im voting for him. Indeed, neither Trump nor Clinton enjoys great popularity. Some 53 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of Clinton, who has been accused of mishandling her emails as secretary of state, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.  Nearly 63 percent have an unfavorable view of Trump. Clinton led Trump by more than 7 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, up from a less than 3-percentage-point lead late last week. ",politicsNews,"August 10, 2016 ",1

Ex-aide: Christie 'lied' about New Jersey 'Bridgegate' - filing,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former aide to Chris Christie said in a text message that the New Jersey governor flat out lied when he said senior staff members were not involved in the Bridgegate scandal in 2013, according to a court filing on Wednesday. The details were revealed in a document filed in New Jersey federal court by Bill Baroni, former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, who is one of two former Christie allies facing trial next month on Bridgegate-related criminal charges. Speculation has persisted for years about whether Christie or members of his staff were aware of an alleged plot to close two New York City-bound lanes at the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee as retribution against Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat who had refused to back the Republican governors re-election campaign. Christie addressed the controversy at a Dec. 13, 2013, news conference, a day after the state legislature issued several subpoenas in its investigation of the lane closures. Ive made it very clear to everybody on my senior staff that if anyone had any knowledge about this that they needed to come forward to me and tell me about it, and theyve all assured me that they dont, Christie said at the time. Christina Renna, former director of Christies intergovernmental affairs office, immediately sent a text message to Peter Sheridan, a member of Christies re-election campaign, according to the filing. Are you listening? He just flat out lied about senior staff and Stepien not being involved, her first text said, referring to Bill Stepien, who managed Christies two gubernatorial campaigns. In a subsequent text, Renna said it could be bad if emails were later uncovered through a subpoena or court discovery. Christie would apologize weeks later at another news conference, when he said he was firing his deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, and that he had been lied to when he told reporters no one on his staff was involved. He also cut ties with Stepien, saying at the news conference that he had lost confidence in Stepiens judgment. Stepien has not been charged in the case. The governors statements have been clear, a Christie spokesman, Brian Murray, said on Wednesday. Nothing contained in this text message changes that in any way. A lawyer for Renna, now vice president of the Chamber of Commerce Southern New Jersey, said she would not address the issue until she testifies at the upcoming criminal trial for Baroni and Kelly. Kevin Marino, a lawyer for Stepien, called the suggestion he might have been involved in Bridgegate categorically false and irresponsible. Sheridan, who works for the state Republican party, did not respond to a request for comment. Jury selection will begin Sept. 12 for Baroni and Kelly, who face charges including conspiracy and fraud. Another former Port Authority official, David Wildstein, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with federal prosecutors. ",politicsNews,"August 10, 2016 ",1
Appeals court suspends ruling rejecting parts of Wisconsin voter ID law,"(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday suspended a July 19 ruling by a federal judge that struck down parts of Wisconsins voter ID law, the Department of Justice said. Under the ruling by U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman, Wisconsin voters who did not have photo identification would have been able to vote in the Nov. 8 presidential election. A Justice Department statement said that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit issued a stay concluding both that the district courts decision is likely to be reversed on appeal and that disruption of the states electoral system in the interim will cause irreparable injury. Wisconsin is one of several Republican-led states that have passed voter ID laws in recent years amid fear of fraudulent voting by illegal immigrants and others. The nine states with the strictest laws, insisting on state-issued photo identification for voters, include Texas, Virginia, Indiana and Georgia. Republicans say voter ID laws are needed to prevent voter fraud. But Democrats say the laws are really intended to make it more difficult for poor African-Americans and Latinos, who skew Democratic in their politics, to vote. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, a Republican, called Wednesdays appeals court decision a step in the right direction. Voters in Wisconsin support voter ID, and our administration will continue to work to make it easy to vote and hard to cheat, Walker said in a statement. In a separate but related case, another federal judge on July 29 struck down a string of Wisconsin voting restrictions passed by the Republican-led legislature and ordered the state to revamp its voter identification rules, finding that they disenfranchised minority voters. U.S. District Judge James Peterson, ruling in a legal challenge to the laws by two liberal groups, said he could not overturn the entire voter ID law because a federal appeals court had already found such restrictions to be constitutional.

Trump Muslim comments do not tarnish view of U.S. freedoms abroad: ambassador,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States does not tarnish the U.S. commitment to religious freedom in the eyes of foreigners, a State Department official said on Wednesday. On Dec. 7, the week after a Muslim couple killed 14 people in San Bernardino, the Republican called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our countrys representatives can figure out what is going on. Speaking as he presented the State Department annual report on religious freedom, David Saperstein, the U.S. ambassador at large for that issue, was asked whether the comments made his job of promoting religious tolerance in foreign nations harder. Countries across the globe ... they see clearly the basic constitutional, institutional constraints against violations of religious freedom in the United States, and I think see clearly and believe deeply in Americas promise to be a model about treating all people equally without regard to religion, Saperstein said. That is clear and that is not tarnished by the statements here, he added. No matter who is elected, the institutions and the United States constitutional constraints will ensure that we continue along the line we have for the last 200 years. At the time, Trumps comments were condemned by the White House, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and some of the candidates then vying with Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. More recently, the parents of a Muslim American Army captain killed in Iraq took Trump to task at the Democratic National Convention over his rhetoric on Muslims, prompting a spat that triggered renewed criticism of the Republican candidate. Democratic presidential nominee Clintons lead over Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election increased to more than 7 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, from less than 3 points on Thursday.

"Trump's remarks on gun rights, Clinton unleash torrent of criticism","WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump suggested on Tuesday that gun rights activists could act to stop Democratic rival Hillary Clinton from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices, igniting yet another fire storm of criticism just as he sought to steer clear of controversy. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks, Trump said at a rally. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I dont know, he continued. The U.S. Constitutions Second Amendment guarantees the right to bear firearms. Before the remark, Trump had been emphasizing his case against Clinton, who is leading in national opinion polls in the race for the Nov. 8 election. Some in the audience in North Carolina who were seated behind Trump could be seen wincing when he made the comment. Clintons campaign called the remark dangerous. A person seeking to be the president of the United States should not suggest violence in any way, it said.  When asked to clarify what Trump meant, his campaign said he was referring to getting supporters of the Second Amendment to rally votes for Trump in the election. Its called the power of unification  2nd Amendment people have amazing spirit and are tremendously unified, which gives them great political power, the Trump campaign said in its statement. Immediately after Trump made his comment, many on social media accused him of effectively calling for Clintons assassination. In just three hours, 2nd amendment became the top trending topic on Twitter, with more than 60,000 posts mentioning the term. Introducing Trump later at another rally in North Carolina, in Fayetteville, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani accused the news media of taking the remark out of context to help Clinton get elected. What he meant by that was you have the power to vote against her, Giuliani said to cheers. You have the power to speak against her. You know why? Because youre Americans. It proves that most of the press is in the tank for Hillary Clinton, he added. They are doing everything they can to destroy Donald Trump. The U.S. Secret Service, which provides security details for both Trump and Clinton and rarely comments on political matters, when asked for a response on Trump, said: The Secret Service is aware of the comment.      Trump later told Fox News Channels Hannity program that nobody in that room thought he meant anything other than to rally support against Clinton. This is a strong powerful movement, the Second Amendment, Trump said. Hillary wants to take your guns away. She wants to leave you unprotected in your home.  This is a tremendous political movement. By days end, Trump was drawing criticism on several fronts, another chapter in a campaign marked by bitterness and  partisanship. Michael Hayden, a former CIA director who on Monday was among 50 Republican national security experts to denounce Trump in a letter, said on CNN, Youre not just responsible for what you say. You are responsible for what people hear. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a liberal firebrand who loves tweaking Trump, tweeted that the Republican nominee makes death threats because hes a pathetic coward who cant handle the fact that hes losing to a girl. Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway fought back in a tweet of her own, calling Warren a disgrace. Gun rights, which have long stirred strong emotions in America, have been a particularly potent issue in the 2016 presidential campaign as violence has convulsed some U.S. cities. Trump has planted himself firmly on the side of gun owners with a law and order campaign. Before his remark about Clinton on Tuesday, he had said Islamic State militants who killed 130 people in France last year could have been stopped if some of the victims had been armed. The Clinton campaign has challenged Trump when in the past he has accused her of planning to abolish the Second Amendment if elected president. Clinton, in her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, said, Im not here to repeal the Second Amendment, saying she wanted common-sense reforms to gun laws. Tuesdays speech came on the heels of a discordant week on the campaign trail for Trump, a businessman seeking his first public office. He came under fire from within his party for belatedly endorsing fellow Republicans in re-election races and a prolonged clash with the parents of fallen Muslim American Army captain Humayun Khan. On Monday, Trump seemed to be heeding Republican advice to stick to a message of criticizing Clinton and other Democrats while putting forward economic policy proposals in a speech in Detroit. Trumps vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, asked if he believed Trump was inciting violence toward Clinton, told NBCs Philadelphia affiliate: Of course not. No. But Democrats called Trumps remarks another sign of a candidate unfit for the White House. Dont treat this as a political misstep. Its an assassination threat, seriously upping the possibility of a national tragedy & crisis, U.S. Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, said in a tweet. Overall sentiment on social media posts on Trumps remarks was more negative than positive, at a ratio of 2.5 to 1, according to the social media analytics firm Zoomph. #ProtectHillary was also one of the top trending hashtags on Twitter. The 50 prominent national security officials said in their letter on Monday that Trump would be the most reckless president in American history. He appears to lack basic knowledge about and belief in the U.S. Constitution, U.S. laws and U.S. institutions, including religious tolerance, freedom of the press, and an independent judiciary, their statement said.

German foreign minister says Trump dangerous for the world,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A series of controversial remarks by U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump show that the world should be concerned if he is elected president, a spokeswoman for German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said on Wednesday. Trump, a billionaire businessman seeking his first public office, has courted controversy with a string of inflammatory statements about women, Mexicans, Muslims and war veterans, among others. Steinmeier, unlike Chancellor Angela Merkel who has said she will not comment on the U.S. election, is not neutral on the issue because he believes it is important to draw attention to the dangers posed by Trump, said spokeswoman Sawsan Chebli. He is indeed not neutral on this question because he thinks that if you follow what Trump is saying then you need to be really anxious about what could become of this world ... if (he) does in fact become president, Chebli told a regular government news conference. Steinmeier is from the centre-left Social Democrats, the junior partner in Merkels conservative-led ruling coalition. A spokeswoman for Merkel said the chancellor did not wish to interfere in the U.S. election campaign. On Monday 50 prominent Republican national security officials, including a former CIA director, described Trump as unqualified to lead the country and said he would be the most reckless president in American history.  Trump is currently in the firing line after suggesting on Tuesday that gun rights activists could act to stop Democratic rival Hillary Clinton from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices.

House Speaker Ryan easily wins primary: media,"MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan handily won a primary election for his congressional seat on Tuesday, a contest overshadowed by presidential candidate Donald Trumps brief refusal last week to endorse his fellow Republican.  Ryan, who ran unsuccessfully for vice president in 2012, had roughly 84 percent of the vote compared with challenger Paul Nehlens 16 percent, with 87 percent of voting areas reporting results, the Journal Sentinel reported at 11 p.m. local time.  I am humbled and honored that Wisconsinites in the 1st Congressional District support my efforts to keep fighting on their behalf, Ryan said in a statement. In the general election for the 1st Congressional District seat in southeast Wisconsin on Nov. 8, he will likely face Iraq war veteran Ryan Solen, who won the Democrat primary on Tuesday.  Nehlen thanked his supporters in a brief Twitter post after the polls closed. Truly an amazing journey, he said.  The race became the center of attention a week ago when Trump refused to endorse Ryan during an interview with the Washington Post. In a sign of the tension between the politicians, Trump told the newspaper he was not quite there yet - echoing a phrase Ryan had used about Trump.  On Friday, Trump endorsed Ryan and Senators John McCain of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire during a campaign stop in Green Bay, a show of support that could be a step to mend his frayed relations with fellow Republicans.  Trump, a former reality TV star, has troubled many in the Republican establishment with his off-the-cuff, often insulting, style and controversial policies. These include a proposed ban on Muslims visiting the United States and his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep out undocumented immigrants. Ryan, Ayotte and McCain had criticized Trumps feud with the family of Army Captain Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq in 2004 and was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star Medal for bravery. Trump had a running dispute with Khans parents after they criticized him at last months Democratic National Convention. ",politicsNews,"August 9, 2016 ",1
"U.S. Vice President Biden to visit Serbia, Kosovo next week","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden will visit Serbia and Kosovo next week, the White House said on Tuesday. A White House statement announcing the Aug. 15-17 Balkan tour said Biden would hold meetings with each countrys president and prime minister, but did not say what subjects would be discussed. The United States last month transferred two inmates from the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to Serbia. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry thanked Serbia for what he called a significant humanitarian gesture. Kerry visited Serbia and Kosovo in December. His stop in Kosovo underscored Western concern over the slow pace of progress 16 years after a U.S.-led NATO air war set the former Serbian province on the road to independence. Kosovo, a mainly Muslim but secular and staunchly pro-American country, declared independence in 2008. ",politicsNews,"August 9, 2016 ",1
Senator Flake: Trump can't win if he can't change,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Jeff Flake said on Tuesday that Republican nominee Donald Trump will not be able to win the presidential election, and should not win it, if he maintains the positions that he holds now, including his harsh stance on immigration. In an interview, Flake said he still hopes Trump will change enough that the Republican senator from Arizona will be able to vote for the candidate in the Nov. 8 election. But, Flake said, Its a slim hope. He said that as things stand, Trump will even have difficulty clinching the state of Arizona if the nominee, who has called for building a wall on the border with Mexico, does not develop a more serious immigration policy. Arizona last voted for a Democratic presidential candidate two decades ago. Given the positions that hes taken, if he continues to maintain those positions, if he continues to hold to the statements he has made, I dont think he can win the presidency, nor do I think he should if he is unwilling to change, Flake said of Trump. There is a big difference between winning a primary, getting what, 14 million votes, and getting 65 million votes that youre going to need to win the presidency. In between those two numbers you encounter a number of swing voters, independents, who simply dont cotton to the kind of message that he has been delivering. And thats just the reality, Flake said. Flake, 53, has long been one of Trumps more vocal critics on Capitol Hill. Trumps inflammatory remarks about immigrants have been a particular problem for Flake, whose Southwestern border state has a large Hispanic population. Flake was among eight senators who proposed comprehensive immigration reform in 2013. Flake memorably told a reporter last month that he would not be attending the Republican convention to nominate Trump because he had to mow the lawn. Flake told Vanity Fair magazine in July: I dont think that theres much worry of a Trump presidency if he doesnt change. But he also insists that he will not vote for the Democratic candidate, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Flake, a member of the House of Representatives for 12 years before being elected to the Senate in 2012, said Arizonans are more realistic and pragmatic on immigration than Trump. Right now, Flake said, Arizona is almost a toss-up in the presidential election. Flake does not have to run for re-election to the Senate until 2018. His fellow Arizona senator, John McCain, is up for re-election this year, and faces both primary and general election challengers. McCain has said he backs Trump. Flake said he respected Senator Susan Collins of Maine, another Republican, who said in an opinion article published on Monday that she definitely would not vote for Trump. Flake said he was not prepared to follow Collins example, which did not set off a stampede of Trump repudiations. ",politicsNews,"August 9, 2016 ",1
"Trump underspends Clinton on TV ads, relying on social media: NBC","(Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump, a former reality TV star, has yet to spend a dime on television advertising for his White House campaign against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, who has spent $52 million, NBC News said on Tuesday.  Adding the money laid out by outside groups supporting the candidates, the Clinton camp has spent $91 million on ads versus $8 million by Trump and his supporters, NBC News said. Nearly $100 million has been spent on general-election TV advertisements in the presidential race since the primary season ended, but Donald Trumps campaign still hasnt spent a single cent on one of them, it said. One group supporting Trump - the Rebuilding America Now PAC led by Florida Governor Rick Scott - said it was rolling out an anti-Clinton ad on cable and local television stations in Ohio, Florida and North Carolina this week. While the New York businessman has not bought ads on ABC, CBS or NBC, which aired his reality show The Apprentice, he has successfully used social media to reach the masses. He frequently posts to his Facebook page and on Twitter, and posts in turn are liked and shared countless times, earning Trump a free form of advertising. A study by media analytics firm mediaQuant placing monetary values on social media mentions estimates Trump is benefiting from about $2 billion in free media so far. That figure is expected to rise to $5 billion by the Nov. 8 election.   Clinton, too, has made gains in social media with 72 million mentions in July, pulling up with Trump in earned media after trailing him for the last eight months, mediaQuant said. The former secretary of state led Trump by more than 7 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday. ",politicsNews,"August 9, 2016 ",1
"Puerto Rico readies fiscal plan, awaits oversight board: governor","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Ricos governor said on Tuesday he expected to present an updated fiscal plan for the debt-laden U.S. territory shortly after the White House appoints members of a federal oversight board with authority to renegotiate its $70 billion of debt. I expect this new fiscal plan will be ready once the board is announced, Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla told reporters in New York via a Skype video conference call from his office in San Juan. The call was part of an event organized by the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism. On June 30th, U.S. President Barack Obama signed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act just one day before the island faced a deadline to make a debt payment of around $2 billion. Garcia Padilla authorized a suspension of the payments just after Obama signed the bill into law.  Under the act, the deadline for naming the seven-member board is Sept. 15. Garcia Padilla said on Tuesday he did not have any idea who would be named nor the timing, but hoped it would happen before the end of August. Obama will choose from candidates presented by Republican and Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives and Senate. Garcia Padilla, who is not running for reelection and has said the board would be an imposition on the islands sovereignty, accepted that the legislation was needed in order to work out a solution. The oversight board has the authority to enforce balanced budgets and government reform if the Puerto Rican government fails to do so, including the sale of government assets, the consolidation of agencies and staff cuts. The board also has the authority to facilitate consensual restructuring talks, or push Puerto Rico into a court-supervised process akin to U.S. bankruptcy. After years of talks between the government and its creditors, failure to reach an agreement on restructuring the debt led to the passage of the legislation that all parties said was imperfect but necessary. Garcia Padilla said he was still open to talking with creditors and that prosperity will not return overnight. ",politicsNews,"August 9, 2016 ",1
Clinton extends lead over Trump to 7 points: Reuters/Ipsos,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintons lead over Republican rival Donald Trump increased to more than 7 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, from less than 3 points on Thursday. The shift came as Trump struggled to reset his campaign following a stretch of controversies. About 42 percent of likely voters favored Clinton and about 35 percent preferred Trump, according to the Aug. 4-8 online poll of 1,152 likely voters, which had a credibility interval of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The others would either pick another candidate, would not vote, or dont know/refused. The results reflected a decline in support for Trump, rather than a boost for Clinton: In last Thursdays poll, 42 percent of likely voters favored Clinton and about 39 percent favored Trump. Among registered voters over the same period, Clinton held a lead of nearly 13 percentage points, up from about 5 percentage points on Thursday, according to the poll.  The five-day survey concluded on a mixed day for the Trump campaign. After squabbles last week with party leaders and the parents of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq, Trump sought to turn the page with a speech outlining an economic platform of tax breaks and regulatory rollbacks.  But in what was surely unwelcome news for Trumps campaign, 50 heavyweight Republican national security officials, in a letter published on Monday, said that Trump would be the most reckless president in American history. Trump hit back, saying the signatories deserve the blame for making the world such a dangerous place. Trump faced more dissent within his party on Monday. A former CIA officer, Evan McMullin, announced he would run as an independent alternative to Trump for conservative Republicans, and Republican Senator Susan Collins said she would not vote for Trump. In a separate Reuters/Ipsos survey that gave respondents the option to choose from Clinton, Trump, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Clinton leads Trump by about 6 percentage points. Of the alternative party candidates, Johnson came in third with nearly 8 percentage points, up from 6 points on Thursday. Stein has about 2 percentage points. The Aug. 4-8 survey of 1,154 likely voters had a credibility interval of 3 percentage points. McMullin was not an option in the poll. ",politicsNews,"August 9, 2016 ",1
Factbox: Why the Zika virus is causing alarm,"Global health officials are racing to better understand the Zika virus behind a major outbreak that began in Brazil last year and has spread to many countries in the Americas.  The following are some questions and answers about the virus and current outbreak: How do people become infected? Zika is transmitted to people through the bite of infected female mosquitoes, primarily the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same type that spreads dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said Aedes mosquitoes are found in all countries in the Americas except Canada and continental Chile, and the virus will likely reach all countries and territories of the region where Aedes mosquitoes are found. How do you treat Zika? There is no treatment or vaccine for Zika infection. Companies and scientists are racing to develop a safe and effective vaccine for Zika, but the World Health Organization (WHO) had said early in 2016 that it would take at least 18 months to start large-scale clinical trials of potential preventative shots. A vaccine is not expected to be ready for widespread use for at least two or three years. U.S. government researchers said they started their first clinical trial of a Zika vaccine. How dangerous is it? The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that infection with the Zika virus in pregnant women is a cause of the birth defect microcephaly and other severe brain abnormalities in babies. The CDC said now that the causal relationship has been established, several important questions must still be answered with studies that could take years. According to the World Health Organization, there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can cause the birth defect microcephaly in babies, a condition defined by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems. In addition, the agency said it could cause Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis. Conclusive proof of the damage caused by Zika may take months or years. Brazil reports the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly at more than 1,700 as doctors and Brazilian health officials find that some suspected cases of microcephaly are not the disorder. Suspected ones under investigation had declined to 3,257. Brazil registered 91,387 likely cases of the Zika virus from February until April 2. Current research in Brazil indicates the greatest microcephaly risk is associated with infection during the first trimester of pregnancy, but health officials have warned an impact could be seen in later weeks. Recent studies have shown evidence of Zika in amniotic fluid, placenta and fetal brain tissue. What are the symptoms of Zika infection?     People infected with Zika may have a mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain and fatigue that can last for two to seven days. But as many as 80 percent of people infected never develop symptoms. The symptoms are similar to those of dengue or chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same type of mosquito. How can Zika be contained? Efforts to control the spread of the virus focus on eliminating mosquito breeding sites and taking precautions against mosquito bites such as using insect repellent and mosquito nets. U.S. and international health officials have advised pregnant women to avoid travel to Latin American and Caribbean countries where they may be exposed to Zika. How widespread is the outbreak? Active Zika outbreaks have been reported in at least 54 countries or territories, most of them in the Americas, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Brazil has been the country most affected. (1.usa.gov/1ovAJyh) Africa (1): Cape Verde  Americas (45): Anguilla, Antigua, Argentina, Aruba, Barbados, Barbuda, Belize, Bolivia, Bonaire, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Curaao, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Saba, Puerto Rico, Saint Barthelmy, Saint Lucia, Saint Martin, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Eustatius, St. Maarten, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Cacos, U.S. Virgin Islands and Venezuela. Oceania/Pacific Islands (8): American Samoa, Fiji, Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Tonga.  What is the history of the Zika virus? The Zika virus is found in tropical locales with large mosquito populations. Outbreaks of Zika have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Southern Asia and the Western Pacific. The virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys and was first identified in people in 1952 in Uganda and Tanzania, according to the WHO.  Can Zika be transmitted through sexual contact? The World Health Organization (WHO) said sexual transmission is relatively common and has advised pregnant women not to travel to areas with ongoing outbreaks of Zika virus. It also  advised women living in areas where the virus is being transmitted to delay getting pregnant. The U.S. CDC is investigating about a dozen cases of possible sexual transmission. Those cases involved possible transmission of the virus from men to their sex partners. But the CDC issued updated recommendations for preventing and testing for Zika infection on July 25, warning that the virus can be transmitted through unprotected sex with an infected female partner. A reported case of female-to-male sexual transmission in New York City, and limited human and non-human primate data indicating that Zika virus RNA can be detected in vaginal secretions, led to the new warning, the agency said. CDCs expanded warnings on sexual exposure to Zika now  caution against sex without a condom or other barrier method of protection with any person, male or female, who has traveled to or lives in an area with Zika, including female to female transmission with a pregnant partner. British health officials reported Zika was found in a mans semen two months after he was infected, suggesting the virus may linger in semen long after infection symptoms fade. The PAHO said Zika can be transmitted through blood, but this is an infrequent transmission mechanism. There is no evidence Zika can be transmitted to babies through breast milk. The WHO has identified Zika cases in Argentina, Chile, France, Italy and New Zealand as likely caused by sexual transmission.  What other complications are associated with Zika? Zika has also been associated with other neurological disorders, including serious brain and spinal cord infections. The long-term health consequences of Zika infection are unclear. Other uncertainties surround the incubation period of the virus and how Zika interacts with other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue. ",politicsNews,"August 4, 2016 ",1

"Icahn praises Trump economic plan, says candidate will get blue-collar vote","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn said on CNBC on Tuesday that Donald Trump is right on about the economy and said the Archie Bunker of the world will vote for the Republican presidential candidate. Archie Bunker, a fictional conservative blue-collar worker from the New York City borough of Queens, was the main character in the 1970s television comedy All in the Family. Icahn praised Trumps economic plan a day after the New York real estate developer unveiled it in a speech in Detroit. Trump proposed sweeping tax breaks, cuts to federal regulations and a revival of the stalled Keystone XL project. Bunker has been described as the shows lovable bigot, but Icahn said there was no bad intention in comparing middle-class voters to the character. Any middle-class worker, you know, the Archie Bunker of the world - that was a great show, I used to watch it - those guys are going to vote for him because those are smart guys, Icahn said.  They know they are getting screwed, and that is what I think will happen, Icahn said in an apparent reference to the decline in U.S. manufacturing, a theme of Trumps. Archie Bunker is a middle-class guy, somewhat educated even, that doesnt know where his next check is coming to send his son or daughter to school, doesnt know if hes going to keep his job. ... Why the hell should he vote for a system that is not giving him a good-paying job? Icahn said. Icahn echoed his remarks on CNBC on Twitter, saying, Trump is right on about our economy. A capitalistic system cannot exist if government is at war with business. CEOs rightly so are afraid to invest in new equipment, etc. to make our manufacturing competitive.  It is no surprise that today it was announced growth in productivity was down for the 3rd straight quarter and is at an all-time low. Our workers cannot be productive with worn out tools.    The Labor Department reported that U.S. nonfarm productivity unexpectedly fell in the second quarter, pointing to sustained weakness in the economy. Trumps speech came after a week of falls in opinion polls and clashes with the family of a fallen U.S. Muslim soldier and fellow Republican leaders. Icahn said he did not defend Trumps remarks about the family of soldier Humayun Khan, calling them a mistake. People make mistakes. Asked by CNBC why Icahn was not named to Trumps group of economic advisers, Icahn said he wanted to focus on a new Super PAC.

"Trump flops with Silicon Valley donors; Clinton falls short, too","(Reuters) - When Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman announced last week that she wouldnt vote for her partys presidential nominee, Donald Trump, she pledged to raise money for the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, and to urge like-minded Republicans to follow suit. She wont have to talk her fellow tech industry conservatives into spurning Trump: They already have.His campaign has pulled in less than 6 percent of what Republican nominee Mitt Romney had raised from tech donors by this point in the 2012 race.  But raising money for Clinton may prove difficult. While the Democrat has raised 25 times more than Trump from tech donors so far, she has drawn less than half of what President Barack Obama had raised from tech employees by this point four years ago, and less than Bernie Sanders, her opponent in the Democratic primary, collected before he left the race. Tech industry employees  long a reliable source of presidential donations, especially for Democrats  have refused to open their wallets for Trump, and theyve been stingier than usual with Clinton, too, according to an analysis performed for Reuters by Crowdpac, a nonpartisan political crowdfunding startup that analyzes campaign contribution data.  Trump and Clinton together reported having received $3.5 million from tech workers as of June 30, compared with $11 million donated to President Barack Obama and his Republican rival Mitt Romney through June 2012, according to the Crowdpac analysis. In 2008, more than $8.3 million in tech donations had gone to Obama and McCain by June 30. For a graphic tracking contributions from tech workers in the last three elections, see: tmsnrt.rs/2b3nEuk The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment on this story. The Clinton campaign asked for the methodology of the Crowdpac analysis but did not comment on its findings. To quantify the tech industrys political giving, Crowdpac tallied contributions of more than $200 - the Federal Election Commissions reporting threshold - from donors who listed technology companies as their employers, as well as individuals who work in related roles, such as software engineers and venture capitalists. Contributions to campaigns, Super PACs and joint fundraising committees were included. The analysis may have missed people who work at small technology companies not yet recognized by Crowdpac, as well as individuals who have given less than $200. Technology firms lobby the government on a range of issues, from privacy and encryption to immigration and trade, and they have a strong interest in who sits in the Oval Office. But this year, campaign finance records and interviews with more than two dozen people in the industry suggest that many would-be donors in Silicon Valley remain unwashed by either candidate.  Matt McIlwain, managing director ofMadronaVenture Group, gave money to Romney in 2011 and to Republican Marco Rubio in years presidential primary election. But he wont support either Trump or Clinton in the general election.  Candidates need to have that embrace of innovation and articulate how it is a road for anybody in our society, he said. Im not inspired by either of the major party candidates.  Democrats consistently draw more tech money than Republicans, but the giving is unusually lopsided this year. Trump has raised a mere $128,000 from 238 tech donors so far. Clinton, by contrast, has raised $3.4 million from 2,976 individuals in the industry, according to Crowdpacs analysis.  At this point in 2012, Romney had raised $2.3 million and Obama had raised $8.8 million. Silicon Valley Republicans say Trumps paltry donation totals are no surprise given his public statements attacking the tech industry.  Earlier this year, Trump called for a boycott of Apple products after the company stopped cooperating with federal law enforcement efforts to break into the password-protected iPhone of one attacker in the mass shooting in San Bernardino. Trump also accused Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos of orchestrating an online retail monopoly.  Trumps positions on limiting immigration and free trade run counter to some of the industrys most basic interests. For Clinton, having a long track record in politics is a liability with some donors in an industry that reveres innovation.  Shes an incremental technocrat, and for people who are used to taking on the world, that is not very inspiring, said Gregory Ferenstein, author of The Age of Optimists, a book about politics and Silicon Valley. To be sure, Clinton has many friends in Silicon Valley, and she has had considerably more success than Trump in wooing deep-pocket donors in the industry.  Venture capitalist John Doerr, for example, has contributed $569,500 to the Clinton campaign and affiliate Super PACs and fundraising committees, and Zynga co-founder Mark Pincus has given $358,800, according to Crowdpac. Many in the valley reason that backing Clinton is the surest way to thwart Trump. We want to make it clear what the risks are of a Trump presidency, but its much more energizing to get excited about a candidate, Box Chief Executive Aaron Levie said in an interview. Some of Obamas biggest Silicon Valley backers have yet to give money in this race, including Pandora Media Chief Executive Tim Westergren, who had donated $74,100 to Obama and to fundraising committees and affiliated Super PACs by June 2012, and venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, who had given $35,000, according to a Crowdpac analysis of donations. Reliable GOP donors, too, have held back. Tiger Global Management Founder Charles Coleman and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen - both of whom had given $102,500 to Romney and affiliated Super PACs and fundraising committees by June 2012 - had yet to donate by June 30. Andreessen has endorsed Clinton. Westergren and Khosla did not respond to requests for comment; Coleman and Andreessen declined to comment. Carrie Sheffield, founder of multimedia company Bold, typically votes for Republicans and donated to Romney, but she says she wont give to - or vote for - Trump.  I dont think that hes fit for office, she said. Both Clinton and Trump have also struggled to convert many donors who gave to their opponents in the primary.  Bernie Sanders raised far more in tech donations during the primary than Clinton, pulling in $6.2 million before leaving the primary race, most of it in small contributions.  In the Republican primary, Marco Rubio drew $5.3 million in tech donations, thanks to a handful of large gifts from top tech executives, including Oracles Larry Ellison, Mark Hurd and Safra Catz.  Josh Smith, a Sanders donor who does not plan to vote in the presidential election, said he was troubled by Clintons comments in a debate last year urging tech companies to work with law enforcement to prevent attacks. The remarks left some in the industry feeling that Clinton would not protect their livelihoods and did not share their beliefs about the sanctity of information, said Smith, founder of Code Corps, which helps developers work on public software projects for social good.  Sanders donor Xiaohoa Michelle Ching said she will vote for Clinton, but has had trouble supporting a candidate who has been readying her path to the presidency for so long.  I am not going to go out of my way, even with the threat of a Trump presidency, said Ching, who is chief executive of Literator, an educational technology startup. Ferenstein predicts that Silicon Valley donations to Clinton will pick up.  Youll see much more money from Silicon Valley flow to Clinton toward the end of the race, he predicted, because people are scared of a President Trump.  ",politicsNews,"August 9, 2016 ",1
"Obama, Senate Democrats urge Zika funding vote as reserves run low","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Thursday said it was time for Congress to lay aside politics and to act to provide additional money to combat the Zika virus before government funding dries up. Our experts at the CDC, the folks on the front lines have been doing their best in making due by moving funds from other areas, but now the money we need to fight Zika is rapidly running out, Obama said at a press conference at the Pentagon. He warned that development of a vaccine for the virus could be delayed if Congress does not provide any more money and urged Americans to contact lawmakers to pressure them to take up the issue. Concern over the threat from Zika, which can cause a birth defect called microcephaly marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies, has risen since Florida authorities last week detected the first signs of local transmission in the continental United States. Zika funding remains stalled six months after Obama asked the Republican-led Congress to approve $1.9 billion in emergency funds. Forty-one Democratic U.S. senators on Thursday sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan urging them to summon lawmakers back from their summer recess to vote on emergency funding to fight the virus. But, Ryan accused Democrats of obstructing the funding and said the Obama administration has failed to spend existing funds to prevent the spread of the mosquito-borne virus. Congress has interrupted its own recesses at least eight times since 1998, most recently in 2013 when lawmakers returned early to debate the use of military force in Syria, according to congressional records. The latest round of finger-pointing indicated there was little chance lawmakers would cut short their seven-week summer break to vote on Zika funding. A $1.1 billion compromise failed after House Republicans attached language that would place restrictions on abortion and defund part of Obamas signature 2010 healthcare law. Senate Democrats, who blocked the measure twice before Congress left Washington last month, want Republicans to agree on a new funding measure that drops those provisions, a step Republicans reject. We need the White House and Senate Democrats to drop politics and put the publics health first. We hope for a change of heart, and soon, Ryan wrote in an opinion piece in the USA Today newspaper. McConnell spokesman Don Stewart invited Democrats to allow the current bill to pass by unanimous consent at a perfunctory session on Friday. ",politicsNews,"August 4, 2016 ",1

Trump seeks a campaign reset with Detroit economic speech,"DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump sought to regain momentum for his White House campaign on Monday by proposing sweeping tax breaks, cuts to federal regulations and a revival of the stalled Keystone XL oil pipeline project. The New York businessman used a speech on the economy in Detroit to try to turn the page after a week of missteps in which he came under heavy criticism, including from some in his own party, and rival Democrat Hillary Clinton surged ahead in opinion polls three months ahead of the Nov. 8 election. I want to jump-start America, Trump said, and it wont even be that hard. Trump stuck to prepared remarks rather than the freewheeling style that often produces controversial comments at rallies. He kept his cool as some 14 protesters jumped to their feet and shouted at coordinated intervals as he spoke at the Detroit Economic Club.  Trumps remarks, which were repeatedly cheered by the crowd, appeared targeted at both an affluent business community and working people, in particular those who have suffered from a decline in U.S. manufacturing in cities such as Detroit. He dismissed Clinton as representing the tired voices of the past.  We now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America, Trump said. Its a conversation about how to make America great again for everyone ... especially for those who have the very least. Much of the speech reflected Republican talking points and critics said his proposals lacked detail. But Republican operatives and others who saw the speech praised Trump for turning his focus to policy and contrasting his ideas with Clintons. The question for Trump now is whether he will be able to keep his campaign on message as Republicans want him to do. Trump pitched a tax plan that mirrored traditional Republican thinking that lowering taxes and slashing regulation generates economic growth and jobs. He proposed lowering individual and corporate rates and a discounted 10 percent levy for businesses that bring back profits held overseas. Trumps plan to create new tax deductions for childcare costs raised questions from economists about whether lower-income families would benefit. Many Republicans remain frustrated with his trade vision, which bucks party orthodoxy by calling for a rewrite of major agreements. My response is good, bad and ugly, said Lanhee Chen, who was policy director for the 2012 presidential campaign of Republican Mitt Romney. I think the trade position remains pretty ugly, he said. But I understand why they did it. I think its a strong effort, at least, to meld elements of conservative economic policy with Trumps more populist thinking. Trumps effort to shift focus came after what was widely seen as the worst week of his campaign, in which he sparred with party leaders and got entangled in a dispute with the parents of a Muslim U.S. soldier who was killed in the Iraq war. Republican Senator Susan Collins added her name on Monday to a growing list of Republican lawmakers who say they will not vote for Trump. Some frustrated Republicans plan to back a conservative alternative, former CIA officer Evan McMullin. On Monday, Trump waited for the frequent disruptions by protesters to end, smiling and refraining from his practice at campaign rallies of asking security to get them out of here. A group called the Michigan Peoples Campaign took credit for the protests, which they said were aimed at Trumps recent comments about sexual harassment. Clinton will outline her economic vision in Michigan on Thursday. In a statement issued before Trumps speech, her campaign said his plan would give tax breaks to the wealthy and big companies and would hurt working families.  At a rally on Monday in St. Petersburg, Florida, she derided a list of economic advisers Trump released last week as six guys named Steve. Now, they tried to make his old, tired ideas sound new, Clinton said. He wants to basically just repackage trickle-down economics. Trumps rough week took its toll in opinion polls. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released on Sunday gave Clinton an eight-point lead, 50 percent to 42 percent.  Trump, a real estate developer who has never held elected public office, touts his practical experience and potential to create jobs, blaming President Barack Obama for what he calls a weak recovery from the economic recession. On Monday, he said Clinton would rely on policies that have not worked. She is the candidate of the past, Trump said. Ours is the campaign of the future. Reaction from the crowd in Detroit was mixed.  I think he laid out a good bullet point on how hes going to solve the economic problems with his trade policies, said insurance executive Sal Giammursta. Others wanted more details. People were looking for more substance, said lawyer Al Rogalski. Trump called for a temporary moratorium on new regulations and repeated his pledges to rewrite the landmark North American trade deal that President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clintons husband, signed in 1994, and to withdraw from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership deal backed by Obama. But much of the reaction was to Trumps tax plan. He again proposed lowering the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from the current 35 percent. And he proposed lowering income-based individual tax brackets to 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent. In 2015, Trump proposed a lower top rate of 25 percent. After criticism from budget experts who said such low rates would balloon deficits, he tweaked his proposal to be more in line with policies supported by Republicans in Congress. Its encouraging that Donald Trump appears to be modifying his tax plan, said Maya MacGuineas, president of the anti-debt Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The research group Tax Policy Center estimated in December that Trumps original plan would reduce federal tax revenues by $9.5 trillion in the first decade.  Steve Moore, an adviser to Trump, said the campaign believes it has made changes to bring the plans cost down to $2 trillion to $3 trillion. A campaign aide said Trump would give more detail in a later speech. ",politicsNews,"August 8, 2016 ",1

Republican national security experts: Trump would be 'dangerous' president,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fifty prominent Republican national security officials, including a former CIA director, on Monday called party nominee Donald Trump unqualified to lead the country and said he would be the most reckless president in American history. The statement was the latest repudiation of Trumps candidacy by veteran Republican national security specialists, and was remarkable for the harshness of its language. Mr. Trump lacks the character, values, and experience to be president. He weakens U.S. moral authority as the leader of the free world. He appears to lack basic knowledge about and belief in the U.S. Constitution, U.S. laws and U.S. institutions, including religious tolerance, freedom of the press, and an independent judiciary, the statement said. None of us will vote for Donald Trump, said the statement, which noted that some signatories also have doubts about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. From a foreign policy perspective, Donald Trump is not qualified to be president and commander in chief, said the statement, which was first reported in the New York Times. Indeed, we are convinced that he would be a dangerous president and would put at risk our countrys national security and well-being. The signatories, some of whom worked for more than one Republican president, included former Central Intelligence Agency Director Michael Hayden, who also headed the National Security Agency; former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff; former Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte; and two former U.S. trade representatives, Carla Hills and Robert Zoelick. Other signatories included former senior State Department, Pentagon and National Security Council officials who helped plan and oversee the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. Trump has harshly criticized the Iraq operation, although when radio host Howard Stern asked him in 2002 if he favored invading Iraq, Trump said he guessed he did. The statement was organized by Philip Zelikow, who served as a top adviser to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Trump responded with a statement deriding the signatories as members of the failed Washington elite who deserve the blame for making the world such a dangerous place. These insiders  along with Hillary Clinton  are the owners of the disastrous decisions to invade Iraq, allow Americans to die in Benghazi, and they are the ones who allowed the rise of ISIS, he continued, using an acronym for the Islamic State militant group. The statement did not cite specific comments by Trump, but it clearly was a response to a series of remarks he has made questioning the need for NATO, expressing admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling for a temporary ban on immigration by Muslims, and inviting Russia to hack Clintons private email server - which he later said was a joke. Many of the signatories had declined to sign an open letter disputing Trumps national security qualifications that was published in March. The statement said many Americans are frustrated with the federal governments failure to solve domestic and international problems. But Donald Trump is not the answer to Americas daunting challenges and to this crucial election, the statement said. We are convinced that in the Oval Office, he would be the most reckless President in American history. Some Democratic foreign policy experts called the statement a reminder of the divisions the New York real estate developers nomination has sown within the Republican Party. This letter is signed by those who remain in the internationalist wing of the party  many were former advisors to candidates who lost the primary fight to Trump, said Brian Katulis, a fellow at the Center for American Progress and a Clinton campaign adviser. Calling Trump unqualified to be commander in chief is tough, but also asserting that hes lacking in character and understanding of our basic values is really pretty amazing, said Tommy Vietor, a former National Security Council spokesman in Democratic President Barack Obamas administration. That said, I think its unlikely to influence many voters, but it could give cover to Republican members of Congress and donors who want to cut the cord and move on from Trump.

Ex-rival sues Illinois House speaker for 'dirty' election tactics,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A vanquished challenger to Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan filed a federal lawsuit on Monday against the longtime Democratic leader, accusing him of using dirty tactics to beat him in a March primary election. Chicago Democrat Jason Gonzales accused Madigan of defaming him and crowding the primary with phony candidates to dilute his opposition. Gonzalez named the 45-year incumbent, the speakers political funds, a top aide and his two other opponents, among others, in a 39-count lawsuit over an alleged scheme to swing the four-way race in the speakers favor.  Madigan won because he engaged in dirty, illegal, fraudulent tactics, Gonzales, who finished second in his bid to topple Madigan with 27 percent of the vote, said in a telephone interview. Madigan received slightly more than 65 percent. Madigan said in a statement that the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago, was without merit.  Voters of my district soundly re-nominated me based on my strong record of service, giving me more than 65 percent of the vote, and they emphatically rejected Jason Gonzales because they knew he couldnt be trusted, said Madigan, who is Illinois longest-serving officeholder, representing Chicagos southwest side since 1971. Neither Grasiela Rodriguez nor Joe Barboza, the two other candidates named in Gonzales lawsuit, could be reached for comment. Gonzales accused Madigan of falsely calling him a felon on television commercials and in political mailers based on several arrests and criminal convictions between 1991 and 1994, including the use of stolen credit cards as an 18-year-old. Gonzales alleged that Madigan improperly publicized those criminal records, which should not have been made public after former Democratic Governor Pat Quinn granted a pardon and expunged Gonzales criminal record in January 2015. Madigans defamatory statement was one that harmed Gonzales reputation to the extent it lowered Gonzales in the eyes of the community and deterred the community from associating with him, his lawsuit alleged. As a direct and proximate result of the foregoing acts and/or omissions by Madigan, Gonzales suffered injuries of a personal and pecuniary nature, including emotional distress, damage to reputation and further punishment despite being granted full pardons, the lawsuit said. Gonzales also accused Madigan and his aides of diluting the Hispanic vote in a legislative district that is about 70 percent Latino by planting two opponents with Hispanic surnames on the ballot. Neither of the candidates, who collectively received nearly 8 percent of the vote, actively campaigned. Gonzales case is being handled by Tony Peraica, a former Republican member of the Cook County board. I couldnt find a Democratic lawyer who was wiling to take the case, Gonzalez told Reuters. Everybody was scared of Madigan. ",politicsNews,"August 8, 2016 ",1
"A disenchanted Republican, fearing Trump, launches third-party run","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former CIA officer and congressional staffer on Monday launched a long-shot bid for president, a Republican billing himself as a conservative alternative to Donald Trump who disenchanted voters can rally around. There is virtually no chance that the newly announced candidate, Evan McMullin, could win and only a slight chance he will even be able to get his name on the ballots of key states. McMullin has no name recognition across the country and was not even well known in the Capitol where until Monday he was the chief policy director for the organizational body of all Republicans in the House of Representatives. But that will not stop some conservatives from pitching him as an option in the Nov. 8 election for those who never warmed to Trump and remain adamantly opposed to Democrat Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump appeals to the worst fears of Americans at a time we need unity, not division, McMullin wrote in a letter announcing his candidacy. With the stakes so high for our nation and at this late stage in the process, I can no longer stand on the sidelines.  McMullins campaign was first reported by MSNBC and BuzzFeed. He could not be immediately reached for comment. Trump was formally anointed his partys nominee last month after beating 16 rivals in the state-by-state primary contests. But many Republicans have been concerned about Trumps policies, such as his proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country, and his free-wheeling, often insulting rhetoric. McMullin has never held public office. In addition to lacking a quick source of campaign cash, he will face immediate hurdles to try to get his name on enough ballot papers to make himself a serious candidate. Texas, for example, requires third-party candidates to get more than 79,000 signatures from residents who did not vote in either the Republican or Democratic primary. And the deadline for that was in early May.  Deadlines to get on the ballots have also lapsed for North Carolina, Illinois and Florida, all large states that also could be pivotal in the election. The best McMullin could likely hope for would be to simply play spoiler to Trump in a handful of states, eating away at the New York real estate developers ability to win states that are generally reliably Republican. McMullin would join two other third-party hopefuls - Gary Johnson, who was nominated by the Libertarian Party, and Jill Stein, who will represent the Green Party. In recent polls that included Trump, Clinton, Stein and Trump, the two third-party candidates have both struggled to get above 10 percentage points in the polls. McMullin, who according to his LinkedIn profile worked in Congress since 2013, has been a frequent critic of Trump on social media, calling him an authoritarian and criticizing his stance on civil rights as well as his refusal to release his tax returns. Prior to working in Congress, McMullin spent 11 years as an operations officer for the Central Intelligence Agency.  Trump, meanwhile, was seeking to reset his campaign with a big economy policy speech on Monday after a rough patch last week. He was widely criticized, including by some senior Republicans, for engaging in a public dispute with the parents of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq. ",politicsNews,"August 8, 2016 ",1
"Billionaire Klarman slams Trump, vows to work for Clinton","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire hedge fund manager Seth Klarman said on Wednesday he would work to get Hillary Clinton elected president of the United States because he finds recent comments by Donald Trump shockingly unacceptable.  His words and actions over the last several days are so shockingly unacceptable in our diverse and democratic society that it is simply unthinkable that Donald Trump could become our president, Klarman said of the Republican presidential nominee. The president and chief executive of The Baupost Group told Reuters in an emailed statement that Trumps suggestion that the election will be rigged is particularly dangerous.  I will continue to find ways to support Hillary Clinton and defeat Donald Trump, he said.   On Monday, Trump told a town hall event in Columbus, Ohio, that he thought the November election might be rigged. Trumps attacks on the Muslim parents of a decorated American soldier, Captain Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq, have drawn sharp rebukes since Khizr Khan and Ghazala Khan appeared at last weeks Democratic convention. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Klarman, whose Boston-based investment firm manages $29 billion, is registered as an independent voter. But a review of filings showed that his political giving has largely benefited Republicans over the years, including donations this election cycle to political action committees that supported primary candidates Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and Marco Rubio. He has also given to the campaigns of Democrats, including now-U.S. Senators Cory Booker and Mark Warner, according to the filings. He contributed $4,600 to Hillary Clintons 2007 presidential race, while also giving to the campaigns of Republicans John McCain and Rudy Giuliani. In June, Klarman gave $5,400 to Clintons campaign. He is completely unqualified for the highest office in the land, Klarman said in his statement, without specifying how he would further support Clinton. ",politicsNews,"August 3, 2016 ",1

Trump to propose deduction on childcare spending: aide,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will propose allowing parents to deduct spending on childcare from their income taxes in a speech on Monday meant to challenge the economic policies of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, a campaign aide said. The aide, who asked not to be identified, said on Sunday in outlining the plan: We dont want it to be an economic disadvantage to have children. The aide said the campaign would have a more detailed childcare plan in the future. A wealthy businessman seeking his first public office, Trump seeks to counter Clintons argument he is out of touch with the problems of working families. He will also say that, unlike Clinton, his business policies would encourage companies to remain in the United States, a concern of blue-collar workers he has tried to court, the aide said. In his speech, to business leaders of the Detroit Economic Club, Trump will also propose stronger protections for American intellectual property and a temporary moratorium on new regulations, the aide said. Seeking to move beyond a week of discord, Trump will outline  plans for trade, taxes, regulation and energy policy. His plans include proposing a 15 percent corporate tax rate, an idea that is on his website. The current federal rate is 35 percent. Senior aides and supporters said in television appearances on Sunday that Trump wanted to put behind him his disputes of last week with Republican Party leaders and the parents of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq. With the economy a major issue, Clinton on Thursday lays out a plan of her own for the biggest investment in good-paying jobs since World War Two, her campaign said. A Democrat like President Barack Obama, Clinton will be buoyed by figures released on Friday showing U.S. employment rose more than expected for a second month in a row in July and wages picked up, bolstering expectations of faster economic growth. Clinton has pledged that no family should pay more than 10 percent of its income on childcare. She has called for a tax cut to help middle-class parents cope with rising childcare costs and an expansion of a federally funded program that provides education and health services to low-income families with young children. In a phone call lasting little more than an hour on Sunday and run by some of Trumps most senior aides, members of his newly announced economic advisory group shared their views on policy, said banker Stephen Calk, one of the members who took part. The Clinton campaign has criticized Trump over the advisory group, announced on Friday, for including no women and relying on members who come from hedge funds and investment banking, a make-up at odds somewhat with Trumps populist message. Calk, chief executive of Federal Savings Bank and National Bancorp Holdings, said Trump had asked advisory group members to nominate women and minorities who could be added to the group. He said there were some big, recognizable names on the call who would be announced soon as joining the team but did not elaborate. A new Washington Post-ABC News opinion poll on Sunday showed Trump trailing Clinton by 8 percentage points after her partys convention in Philadelphia. A Reuters/Ipsos poll out on Friday showed the race closer three months ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. ",politicsNews,"August 7, 2016 ",1
"Bentley, former Congresswoman from Maryland, dies at 92","(Reuters) - Helen Delich Bentley, a former journalist and a U.S. Republican congresswoman from Maryland who gained global attention by smashing Japanese goods to protest Tokyos trade policies, died over the weekend at the age of 92, officials said. Bentley upset a longtime Democratic congressman to win a U.S. House of Representatives seat in 1984, a year in which Ronald Reagans landslide victory in the presidential race helped bring several new faces from the party to Congress. The five-term congresswoman was a staunch advocate for the port of Baltimore and the states maritime industry. After reports that Japanese company Toshiba had sold technology to the Soviet Union to help their submarines sail more quietly, she led other members of Congress who used a sledgehammer to smash Japanese-made goods on the Capitol steps. The event came as tensions were running high with Tokyo over a widening U.S. trade deficit with the country.  She left Congress to run for governor of Maryland but lost in the partys primary. Congresswoman Bentley worked with tenacity, energy, and passion on behalf of her constituents, making her a rare breed in politics and a role model to public servants across Maryland, current Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, wrote in a Facebook post. Bentley was born in 1923 in Nevada and her parents were immigrants from Yugoslavia. After earning a bachelors degree in journalism, she found a job with the Baltimore Sun, beginning a three-decade long relationship with the newspaper in which she wrote ground-breaking stories on the maritime industry and labor, according to her congressional biography. She died on Saturday at her home in Timonium, a Baltimore suburb, the Baltimore Sun reported, adding Bentley had been diagnosed with brain cancer. ",politicsNews,"August 7, 2016 ",1
Trump ends difficult week by focusing on Hillary Clinton,"WINDHAM, N.H. (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump on Saturday ended a tough week for his campaign in the state that launched him toward the presidential nomination and he did what Republicans have been urging him to do: Keep the focus on Democrat Hillary Clinton. Her greatest achievement is getting out of trouble, Trump told supporters. Trumps victory in the Feb. 10 Republican primary in New Hampshire put him in position to win the partys nomination, but he trails Clinton in the state by 15 points in the latest WBUR/MassINCpoll, 47 percent to 32 percent. Trump came to New Hampshire after a troubled week in which he tangled with fellow Republican leaders and sparred verbally with the parents of a Muslim soldier who died fighting for the United States in Iraq in 2004. Clinton, getting a lift from the Democratic National Convention, took advantage of Trumps stumbles to surge into the lead in national polls and in many battleground states.  Now Trump has begun heeding the advice of Republican officials who say he needs to take the fight to Clinton to give the party a chance to win the White House on Nov. 8. Trump seized on Clintons comments Friday that she had short-circuited when she said a week ago that FBI Director James Comey had said she had been truthful to the American people in her use of a private email server while U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. In fact, Comey had concluded that Clinton was extremely careless with classified emails. He directly contradicted many of the statements Clinton had made about her use of the server. Trump spent the lions share of a campaign speech in a crowded high school gymnasium to go after Clinton on the subject in trying to raise questions about her trustworthiness. I think the people of this country dont want somebody who is going to short circuit, Trump said. Trump also sought to turn the tables on Clinton, who has consistently accused the New York developer of being temperamentally unfit to be president. She is a totally unhinged person, Trump said.

On the trail with Mike Pence: Putting out fires lit by Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If Mike Pence had any doubts about what life would be like on the 2016 Republican presidential ticket with Donald Trump, the past week will have erased them: He is the damage control guy. The Indiana governor who swore off political mudslinging years ago heard Trump call Democratic rival Hillary Clinton the devil and watched him fan the flames of a feud with the parents of a Muslim soldier who died saving U.S. troops in Iraq. Unlike many vice presidential running mates, the mild-mannered Pence was not tapped as the attack dog in the Nov. 8  presidential election. Trump has that part down pat. Pences job is harder: softening Trumps rough edges and limiting the fallout from what many Republicans see as the nominees self-inflicted wounds. A week ago, for example, Pence rowed back on Trumps blacklist of some media outlets, saying the campaign is discussing changing course. Last Sunday, as Trumps dispute with the parents of slain U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan boiled over, Pence issued a statement praising the soldier as an American hero and saying that his family should be cherished by every American.  On Wednesday, Pence offered his own endorsement to House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican, after Trump infuriated many party leaders by declining to endorse Ryan in his re-election bid. Pence, who swore off negative campaigning after losing a vituperative congressional race in 1990, eschews name calling. Trump, by contrast, delights in using monikers such as Crooked Hillary and the devil to describe Clinton. Trump has made clear he values Pence, telling a rally on Thursday in Portland, Maine, that he and his running mate have a great relationship. But Pence must walk a fine line. Even as he defuses Trumps verbal bombs, Pence must be careful to show he knows who is boss. He also has to stick to his own principles while not appearing to be trying to undermine the man who chose him as his No. 2. Should Trump win, Pence, a former congressman, could serve as a conduit to the U.S. Congress. But if Trump loses, Pence could emerge as a possible White House contender for 2020. Republican strategist Charlie Black said Pence has shown some political deftness. He should have expected he would do some of this and provide more of the even-tempered, articulate, measured responses, Black said. But Republican strategist Ryan Williams said Pence is in an impossible spot and said that Trumps missteps could cast a shadow over his running mates political future.  Mike Pence is a good Republican but unfortunately he will be associated with the controversies that have ensnared the Trump-Pence ticket and will be tied to whatever the consequences of this election are,  Williams said.  Trumps off-the-cuff insults and controversial proposals, such as a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and a plan to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep illegal immigrants out, have made many in the party establishment uneasy. The Republican nominees feud with the Khan family made for an awkward moment for Pence at a campaign event in Carson City, Nevada. A military mother asked Pence how could he tolerate Trumps disrespect for the armed forces, which prompted boos. Pence admonished the crowd to tone it down. Folks, thats what freedom looks like and thats what freedom sounds like, he said before calling Humayun Khan an American hero. Pence was asked on Thursday by an 11-year-old boy at a North Carolina rally if his role was softening up Trumps policies and words. Pence replied that he and Trump were shoulder to shoulder in the campaign. Christopher Devine, co-author of the book The VP Advantage and an assistant political science professor at the University of Dayton in Ohio, said that if Trump loses the November election, Pence may try to position himself as a conservative bridge between Trump supporters and traditional Republicans. That may be an added reason for Pences cautious approach. He has to be very careful about how he handles the defense of Donald Trump, Devine said. ",politicsNews,"August 5, 2016 ",1
Obama administration releases redacted version of drone policy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration released a redacted version of President Barack Obamas once-secret policy on drone strikes abroad following a freedom of information lawsuit filed last year, the American Civil Liberties Union said on Saturday. The release of the 18-page Presidential Policy Guidance document, as well as other Department of Defense papers, follows an order by a U.S. District Court judge in February requiring the Justice Department to disclose the document, also known as the Playbook. It sets out the law and rules the government must follow when carrying out targeted killings and the capture of terrorist suspects abroad.  Obama pledged in 2013 to provide greater transparency about counter-terrorism operations, including drone strikes overseas, amid calls by some U.S. lawmakers and rights groups for more openness.   ACLUs deputy legal director, Jameel Jaffer, welcomed the release of the documents, saying they provide new details about policy standards and insights into the process for targeting individuals with lethal force or for capture. Its release now will inform an ongoing debate about the lawfulness and wisdom of the governments counter-terrorism policies, Jaffer said in a statement. The ACLUs lawsuit sought information, among other things, on the law and policies used to justify lethal force and how the government picks targets. According to the documents, published by the ACLU, strikes against high-value terrorist targets can be taken when there is near certainty that the person is present, and that no civilians will be injured or killed, and is necessary to achieve U.S. policy objectives. The administration has defended its use of drones as essential in fighting al Qaeda and other militants in countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen. Some drone strikes have killed civilians who were not targets, igniting local anger. The president has emphasized that the U.S. Government should be as transparent as possible with the American people about our counter-terrorism operations, the manner in which they are conducted, and their results, National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said of Saturdays release of documents. Our counter-terrorism actions are effective and legal, and their legitimacy is best demonstrated by making public more information about these actions as well as setting clear standards for other nations to follow, he added. Naureen Shah, Amnesty Internationals U.S. director for security and human rights, also welcomed the documents but said more was needed to ensure the policy was followed. The Obama administrations disclosures are welcome but they only tell part of the story and obscure disturbing practices. We still know extremely little about the standards that would govern signature strikes and so-called rescuer strikes, which have involved potentially unlawful killings, Shah added.

"Trump endorses Ryan, senators in effort to right campaign ship","GREEN BAY, Wis./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump acted to steer his White House campaign back into favor with his partys establishment on Friday by endorsing U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and two Republican senators seeking re-election, after expressing coolness toward them earlier this week. I need a Republican Senate and a House to accomplish all of the changes that we have to make, Trump said during a rally in Green Bay, in northern Wisconsin, Ryans home state. He also endorsed Senators John McCain of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, calling Ayotte a rising star. We will have disagreements, but we will disagree as friends, Trump said,  Trump earlier this week refused to endorse Ryan, telling The Washington Post he was not quite there yet - nearly the same phrase Ryan had used about Trump before finally endorsing him. Trump said in the same interview that McCain had not done enough for veterans and criticized Ayotte for distancing herself from him during the campaign. Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican, had no plans to attend the Wisconsin event, a sign of lingering frictions between the pair, even though Trumps running mate, Mike Pence, did endorse him. Ryans Republican primary challenger, businessman Paul Nehlen, did attend, according to a spokesman. Ryan is expected to win the challenge for his House seat in next weeks Republican primary, and he is viewed by many Republicans as a possible presidential candidate in the future. The tension between Ryan and Trump caused deep frustration among party leaders and lawmakers. Trumps endorsement came as one of several steps to get his campaign back on track after days of controversy and falling poll numbers that have given Democrat Hillary Clinton the advantage in the race to the Nov. 8 election. In the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday, Clintons lead over Trump narrowed to less than 3 percentage points, down from nearly 8 points on Monday. Trump said on Friday he wanted a big tent party with multiple viewpoints welcome. He said he was endorsing the Republican lawmakers due to their shared mission to make America great again. Trump also announced a new advisory team to help guide him on economic policy. The group relies heavily on hedge fund managers and investment bankers, a group Trump has railed against. There are no women on the team. Trump plans to release his economic policy framework in a speech in Detroit on Monday, an event that will offer him a chance to avoid theatrics and detail how he would handle economic issues if elected. Trump economic adviser Stephen Moore told Reuters that the candidates plan would focus on four areas: tax, deregulation, energy policy and trade. Its going to be an all-encompassing look at how we reform the economy, Moore said. At events in Des Moines, Iowa, and Green Bay, Trump showed discipline that is unusual at his often free-wheeling rallies, calling Clinton the queen of corruption and defending himself against her charge that he is temperamentally unfit for the White House. All my life Ive been told, You have the greatest temperament, he said in Des Moines. He also said voters should consider supporting him because of Pence, who appeared with him at both events. If you dont like me, thats okay. Vote for Pence because its the same thing, Trump said. Trump bashed the media as well, saying reporters over-hyped an incident earlier in the week and claimed he kicked a baby out of an event in Virginia. I love babies, he said. SHORT-CIRCUITED Clinton sought to take advantage of Trumps dip in the polls at a conference of minority journalists in Washington, where she pledged an all-out fight for comprehensive immigration reform. And she did what she has rarely done during the presidential campaign: take questions from reporters. She addressed two of the largest issues that continue to dog her campaign: the controversy over her use of a private email server while she was U.S. secretary of state and continuing skepticism among voters about her trustworthiness. Clinton conceded that she had short-circuited earlier in the week in interviews when she had asserted that FBI director James Comey had concluded that she had been truthful in her statements about use of the private server.  Clinton had repeatedly said she never sent emails containing classified material, a finding that Comey contradicted at the conclusion of the FBIs probe in July, when he rebuked her for extremely careless handling of classified information while recommending that no criminal charges be filed. On Friday, Clinton maintained, I never sent or received anything marked classified, while acknowledging that some material she sent may retroactively have been considered classified by other government agencies. Republicans have repeatedly charged that Clinton endangered national security with her handling of classified material. The email controversy has fueled a perception among a majority of voters that Clinton is untrustworthy. I take it seriously, she said. Still, as she has often done during her career, Clinton attributed much of her low standing on this issue to attacks from Republicans. Trumps campaign said his economic advisory panel included former steel executive Dan DiMicco; Howard Lorber, CEO of tobacco company Vector Group Ltd (VGR.N); and Trump campaign finance chairman and investment manager Steven Mnuchin.  Hedge fund managers John Paulson and Steve Feinberg, Moore, the Trump economic adviser, and David Malpass, who has served in previous Republican administrations, were also named. Trumps moves came after many Republicans urged the candidate to correct course following a tumultuous week. The real estate mogul and former reality television star was  caught up for days in a public spat with the parents of a Muslim  American soldier killed in Iraq. The parents had criticized Trump at last weeks Democratic National Convention. Many Republicans, including Ryan, McCain and Ayotte, were critical of Trumps insistent attacks on the pair.

Clinton's lead over Trump narrows to less than three points: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintons lead over Republican rival Donald Trump narrowed to less than 3 percentage points, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Friday, down from nearly eight points on Monday. About 42 percent of likely voters favored Clinton, to Trumps 39 percent, according to the July 31-Aug. 4 online poll of 1,154 likely voters. The poll had a credibility interval of plus or minus 3 percentage points, meaning that the results suggest the race is roughly even. Among registered voters over the same period, Clinton held a lead of five percentage points, down from eight percentage points on Monday, according to the poll.  The reasons behind the shift were unclear.  Clinton had pulled well ahead of Trump on the heels of the Democratic National Convention last week, where she became the first woman to accept the U.S. presidential nomination from a major political party.  Since then, Trump has engaged in a days-long feud with the family of an American soldier killed in Iraq and squabbled with the Republican leadership over his comments and leadership turmoil within his campaign. Trump, in recent days, however, has sought to refocus. On Friday he announced his economic policy advisory team, said he would deliver an economic policy speech early next week, and was expected to endorse U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican, who is seeking his 10th term in Congress. An average of polls aggregated by Real Clear Politics showed Clinton ahead of Trump by 6.8 percentage points on Friday, up from 3.9 on Aug. 1. ",politicsNews,"August 5, 2016 ",1
Factbox: Republican presidential candidate Trump's economic team,"(Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Friday announced his team of economic advisers, among whom are a hedge fund manager, a former top steel executive and a former high-ranking U.S. government official.  Trump said he would deliver a speech on his economic policy plan on Monday. Here are some facts on the members of his economic team: Paulson is best known on Wall Street for his bet against the overheated housing market in 2007 that netted him and his investors billions of dollars in profits. But Paulsons calls on stocks and the economy have been less accurate lately. His investments have lost some $15 billion in assets in the last five years, leaving his Paulson & Co Inc hedge fund with roughly $13 billion at the end of June. He is known for making contrarian bets and being patient.  He has been one of only a handful of hedge fund managers to have publicly endorsed Trump. Many others have said privately that they are still on the fence or leaning toward his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Feinberg is chief executive officer of Cerberus Capital Management LP, a private equity firm he co-founded in 1992.  He headed the investment firm during its failed takeover of automaker Chrysler in 2007. The investment firm served as Chryslers majority owner until the troubled car maker was restructured in a government-sponsored bankruptcy in 2009. Feinberg had promised to revive the company, according to a New York Times profile, but instead lost billions. (here) Feinberg has defended his role to try to save the carmaker. He ultimately had to appeal to Washington for help.      Malpass served under two previous Republican administrations, first as a deputy assistant Treasury secretary for President Ronald Reagan and later as a deputy assistant secretary of State for President George H.W. Bush.         Malpass, in a CNBC interview on Friday, called for greater infrastructure spending as well as tax cuts, trade reform, regulatory reform and energy reform, although he gave few specifics. We need more effective spending and Trump wants to do that - to have stronger finances for the country, he said. Malpass has been a vocal critic of the U.S. Federal Reserves monetary policy since the financial crisis, in particular its large bond holdings. Malpass, who was also previously chief economist at investment bank Bear Stearns, now runs Encima Global Llc, an investment consulting firm.   Navarro is the only adviser on the list with a doctorate in economics and the only one who has spent most of his life as an academic. He earned his doctorate at Harvard University and is now a professor of economics and public policy at the University of California, Irvines business school. Navarro has written nine books, three of them critical about Chinas effect on the rest of the world, including Death by China: Confronting the Dragon  A Global Call to Action. He thinks the United States should be tougher on trade and intellectual property theft and has proposed slapping a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports.  Navarro recently wrote in an opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times that Trump would crack down on any country that cheats on its trade deals using practices such as currency manipulation and illegal export subsidies. (here) Lorber is president and CEO of holding company Vector Group Ltd (VGR.N), whose three subsidiaries make cigarettes as well as e-cigarettes. Vector also operates two real estate subsidiaries: a real estate investment company and a real estate brokerage firm.  A fellow New Yorker, Trump's campaign has mentioned Lorber as one of Trump's best friends. (here) The two traveled together to Russia in the 1990s, according to news reports. A former partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc who now works in entertainment financing, Mnuchin is chairman and CEO of private investment firm Dune Capital Management LP.  Trump named Mnuchin, who had a long history of political donations to Democrats, including to Hillary Clinton, as his finance chair in May. Mnuchin has said he has had a personal and professional relationship with Trump for more than 15 years. DiMicco is the former chief executive and executive chairman of steel producer Nucor Corp (NUE.N), one of the biggest U.S. steelmakers. His outspoken push for tougher U.S. trade policies to support domestic manufacturing and his fierce anti-China rhetoric have made him one of the most high-profile executives in the steel industry. In recent years, he has taken his campaign for new trade rules online and has publicly endorsed Trumps call for a tougher approach on trade.  You dont win a Trade War with appeasement or more Free Trade agreements, DiMicco wrote in a July 10 blog post on his website, www.dandimicco.com.  Moore is one of the leading conservative economic voices in the United States. He embraces tax cuts as key to economic growth, as well as free trade and immigration reform. Moore founded the anti-tax advocacy group Club for Growth, where he served until he left the organization in 2004. He later served as a member of The Wall Street Journal editorial board.      He is currently a fellow at the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, focusing on economic growth.  Barrack is a longtime friend of Trump and a fellow hotel developer. He is the founder and executive chairman of private equity firm Colony Capital Inc CLNY.N and is co-chairman of the board of trustees of Colony Starwood Homes SFR.N. Barrack spoke out in favor of Trump at the Republican National Convention in July, but afterwards his company announced it was dropping out of Trump's Old Post Office hotel project in Washington, according to a report in The Washington Post. (here) Kowalski has served as the deputy staff director of the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and has over 20 years of experience in fiscal policy at the federal, state and local levels of government. He has a masters degree in public policy from Harvards Kennedy School of Government.

Calk is the founder, chairman and CEO of Federal Savings Bank, and National Bancorp Holdings. He is a commissioned Army officer and received his MBA from Northwestern University.  Roth is chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Vornado Realty Trust (VNO.N), which focuses on real estate investments in New York City and Washington, D.C. Vornado and Trump are partners in an office building in midtown Manhattan. ",politicsNews,"August 5, 2016 ",1
Trump's economic advisory group clashes with populist image,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps team of economic policy advisers is packed with moguls from the hedge fund and investment banking industries that he has railed against in the past. And none of them are women - a demographic group he needs to court if he hopes to win in November. Trumps campaign has been powered by a populist message that criticizes corporate America for outsourcing jobs, profiting at the expense of everyday workers and buying influence in Washington. The message resonates best with middle-class and working-class voters buffeted by the forces of globalization.  But among the members of the 13-member team of advisers announced on Friday are hedge-fund billionaire John Paulson and investment bankers Steve Feinberg and Andy Beal, as well as a former top steel executive and a former high-ranking U.S. government official.  It is a hallowed campaign tradition. Malign an industry, but court its wealthy big shots, saidErik Gordon, a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan. The reliance on Wall Street executives comes after Trump spent much of his primary campaign lambasting the industry for paying too little in taxes. The hedge fund guys are getting away with murder, Trump said in an interview last year. One of the best known of Trumps panel is Paulson, whose bet against the overheated housing market in 2007 netted him and his investors billions of dollars. His bets have since gone the other way, losing some $15 billion in the last five years. Don Steinbrugge, managing partner at investment consulting firm Agecroft Partners LLC, said Trump could benefit from his advisers expertise on global capital markets if he would listen to them. Whether Trump will heed the counsel of his conservative-leaning economic advisers or steer his own course was also raised by Lanhee Chen, who served as a top policy aide to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2012.  Its hard to see a consistent strain of conservative economic thought, Chen said, citing Trumps protectionist policies on trade as an example of where Trump differs from the Republican partys free-market economic orthodoxy. The panel also includes former steel executive Dan DiMicco; oil magnate Harold Hamm; Howard Lorber, the CEO of tobacco company Vector Group Ltd; Trump campaign finance chairman Steven Mnuchin, a former partner at Goldman Sachs who is now chairman and CEO of private investment firm Dune Capital Management LP; and David Malpass, a former official of the U.S. Treasury and State departments. James Pethokoukis, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, noted the absence of representatives from the tech and venture capital sectors.  If I was assembling a task force to analyze the big challenges facing the American economy and to develop solutions, I am not sure that a group like this would naturally spring to mind, he said. But the panel fits with the themes of Trumps campaign in another way. Trump often has boasted about bringing in successful business people to tackle Washingtons entrenched problems, and many of Trumps supporters see his background in business as among his biggest assets. Some critics seized upon the lack of women on Trumps panel. After being asked this week to identify women he might appoint to his cabinet if elected, Trump could only respond with the name of his daughter Ivanka.  Democratic rival Hillary Clinton hit Trump on the comment in a Twitter post, comparing him to Romney who, when asked a similar question during his campaign, said hed reviewed binders full of women. We know a guy with a binder,@realDonaldTrump. (He might not take your calls, though.) Clintons campaign wrote. The campaign declined to comment on Trumps advisers. Trump has struggled with women voters since his campaign began. Some 65 percent of women have an unfavorable view of Trump, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, compared with 53 percent who have an unfavorable view of Clinton. Kellyanne Conway, a pollster who works for the Trump campaign, said the emphasis on gender on the economic team is misplaced. Women voters, she said, care more about their economic well-being than the make-up of an advisory group. What female voters wish to know is whose economic plan will be better for them, she said.

"Icahn declines to join Trump economic team, mulls second Super PAC"," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn turned down an invitation to join Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps economic advisory council because Icahn is considering funding a Super PAC focused on regulatory reform, Icahns general counsel told Reuters on Friday.  This would be his second Super PAC. Technically known as independent expenditure-only committees, Super PACs may raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, associations and individuals, then spend unlimited sums to advocate for or against political candidates.  DONT MISS: Factbox: Trump's economic team Want to build your ownEconomic Dream Team? Try this machine. Trump looks to right the ship The first Super PAC Icahn formed had an initial commitment of $150 million and was targeted at tax inversions, which occur when a company moves its headquarters outside the United States to take advantage of lower tax rates elsewhere.  Mr. Icahn declined the opportunity to join the Trump economic advisory council because at this time, were still considering whether to fund and manage our own Super PAC focused on regulatory reform, Jesse Lynn, general counsel to Icahn, said by telephone.  FEC (Federal Election Commission) rules would limit that activity if Mr. Icahn were to become directly involved in the campaign by joining the council, Lynn said.  There was no immediate comment from the Trump campaign.  Trump announced his economic advisory team on Friday, and said he would release his plan to boost the U.S. economy in a speech on Monday.  Trump has floated Icahns name for U.S. Treasury secretary if he was elected president. Icahn, 80, has repeatedly rejected the notion of accepting such an offer.  Lynn did not give any details on what kind of regulatory reforms a new Super PAC may target.  In September, Icahn released a video titled Danger Ahead, in which he endorsed Trump for president and criticized the Federal Reserve for creating a new bubble in the corporate bond market.  BEST OF BIZ: Reuters Investigates:Big coal summoned Wall Street and faced a whirlwind Again at highs, stocks to take cues from consumer Breakingviews:Wal-Mart has long unicorn ride in Amazon chase He said the rich paid too little in taxes and called for an end to the loophole that allows private equity firms and some hedge fund managers to pay low tax rates on their investments by classifying them as carried interest.  The activist investor has recently been a vocal critic of the dangers of retail investors buying junk bonds, debt sold by highly leveraged companies. Much of this debt is sold to Mom and Pop investors via exchange-traded funds, a popular vehicle for trading baskets of bonds and stocks.  In October, Icahn announced his first Super PAC, which was the biggest one-time injection of money in the history of such political action committees. Icahn said the incentive for companies to leave the United States via inversion deals could be eliminated by legislation allowing big companies to repatriate funds held offshore at a discounted tax rate - an approach also favored by Trump.  A Wall Street veteran, Icahn made his fortune buying stakes in companies such as RJR Nabisco, Texaco, Phillips Petroleum, Lions Gate Entertainment Corp, Netflix Inc, Apple Inc and eBay Inc and pushing their management to change their strategies.

Senior ex-CIA official: Putin made Trump 'an unwitting agent' of Russia,"(Reuters) - A former top CIA official attacked Donald Trump on Friday as a danger to national security, saying President Vladimir Putin had made the Republican presidential candidate an unwitting agent of Russia. Putin had flattered Trump into supporting positions favorable to Russia, Michael Morell, a longtime CIA officer and former deputy director of the agency, said in an opinion piece in The New York Times. In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation, Morell said, in an article in which he endorsed Trumps rival in the Nov. 8 election, Democrat Hillary Clinton. Morell did not provide evidence for his assertion, but he said Putin had used skills from his past as an intelligence officer to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in an individual. That is exactly what he did early in the primaries. Mr. Putin played upon Mr. Trumps vulnerabilities by complimenting him. He responded just as Mr. Putin had calculated, Morell wrote. Trumps campaign dismissed Morells criticism, linking the ex-CIA officer to the Obama administrations public response after the September 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. Count how many reporters will tweet today that Michael Morell lied for #CrookedHillary to cover up Benghazi, Trumps campaign said in a Twitter message.  The incident, in which the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans were killed, occurred while Clinton was secretary of state, and Republicans have long criticized her handling of the attack and its aftermath. Critics say administration officials tried to play down the role of Islamist militants in the attacks. Morell approved talking points after the incident. U.S. officials have said any reference to militants taking part was initially dropped for classification reasons. Morell is currently affiliated with Beacon Global Strategies, a consulting firm with ties to senior Democrats with national security expertise, including former defense secretary and CIA director Leon Panetta and former top Clinton aide Philippe Reines. Trumps vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, on Friday dismissed Morells comments, saying that  standing up to Russian aggression is going to be really different under a Trump-Pence administration. These people are playing politics, Pence said of Morell in an interview on NBCs Today program.  Morells article, in which he also said Trump had undermined U.S. security with his campaign proposal to combat terrorism by imposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, added to questions raised by some national security experts about the New York businessmans qualifications to be president. On Thursday, a bipartisan group of experts criticized Trumps lukewarm support for the NATO alliance, comments about Russias annexation of Crimea and other matters as disgraceful. Trump has also drawn criticism for his praise for Putin as a strong leader, particularly after Moscow came under suspicion from U.S. officials as being behind recent hacking of Democratic Party groups. Moscow has denied the allegations.  ",politicsNews,"August 5, 2016 ",1
Clint Eastwood: Trump says 'dumb things' but people should 'get over it'," (Please note strong language in paragraphs 3, 11) By Jill Serjeant (Reuters) - Clint Eastwood, the 86-year-old four-time Oscar winner, excoriated the current generation of Americans as weak and overly sensitive while backing Donald Trump even though the Republican presidential hopeful has said a lot of dumb things. Eastwood, a prominent celebrity supporter of the Republican Party who appeared at its 2012 U.S. presidential nominating convention, offered a harsh assessment of Americans in an interview with Esquire magazine published on Wednesday. Hes onto something because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness, kissing up, the acclaimed actor and director said of Trump. Thats the kiss-ass generation were in right now. Were really in a pussy generation. Everybodys walking on eggshells. We see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff. When I grew up, those things werent called racist, Eastwood added. Given the choice between Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Trump in the Nov. 8 election, the celebrated star of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly said, Thats a tough one, isnt it? Id have to go for Trump ... you know, cause shes declared that shes gonna follow in Obamas footsteps. In one of the most unusual speeches at a major U.S. party convention, Eastwood four years ago addressed an empty chair used to symbolically represent President Barack Obama on stage at the Republican convention in Tampa, Florida, in a rambling denunciation of Obama. Asked by Esquire what troubled him most, Eastwood referred to his chair speech. What troubles me ... I guess when I did that silly thing at the Republican convention, talking to the chair, Eastwood said. In the interview, Eastwood made reference to the uproar in May that followed Trumps comments accusing the judge overseeing a fraud lawsuit involving Trump University real-estate seminars of being biased against him because of Trumps pledge to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border to block illegal immigrants. U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel is an American of Mexican descent. Eastwood told Esquire that Trump was portrayed as a racist now because hes talked about this judge. And yeah, its a dumb thing to say. I mean, to predicate your opinion on the fact that the guy was born to Mexican parents or something, Eastwood said. Hes said a lot of dumb things. So have all of them. Both sides. But everybody - the press and everybodys going, Oh, well, thats racist, and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it. Just fucking get over it. Its a sad time in history. There were more than 100 tweets per minute about Eastwood on Twitter by Thursday afternoon.

California mayor charged in youth camp strip poker scandal,"(Reuters) - The mayor of Stockton, California, was arrested on Thursday on a felony eavesdropping charge stemming from a strip poker game he is accused of surreptitiously recording at a summer camp he hosts for disadvantaged inner-city children, prosecutors said. Mayor Anthony Ray Silva, 41, was also charged with three misdemeanor counts - contributing to the delinquency of a minor, child endangerment and furnishing alcoholic beverages to individuals under the legal drinking age of 21, according to a criminal complaint filed in court. Silva is accused of using his cellphone to make an audio recording of conversation among several young people, including a 16-year-old boy, who were playing strip poker with the mayor inside his cabin at the camp. Prosecutors said in a media statement it was evident that the participants, who were naked, were recorded against their will. Amador County District Attorney Todd Riebe said those present besides the mayor included two to three females and three males, all ranging in age from 18 to 20. The criminal complaint further accuses Silva of supplying alcohol to six underage youths. Prosecutors said some were camp counselors. The incidents, according to prosecutors, took place last August at the Stockton Silver Lake Camp in Amador County, which lies in California Gold Country on the edge of the Sierras northeast of Stockton. In addition to hosting unprivileged children at the city-leased camp each summer, Silva has served as president of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Stockton for the past six years. Silvas lawyer, Mark Reichel, told Reuters his client will be vindicated and suggested the case was politically motivated, noting that the mayor, a Republican, faces a tough election run-off in November against a Democratic city councilman. Asked whether Silva was playing strip poker with youths from his camp, Reichel replied, I highly doubt it. Reichel added, I cant wait to fight them in court, so we can expose the epidemic of kids at summer camp playing strip poker. Silva was elected mayor of Stockton, a city of about 300,000 east of San Francisco, in November 2012, months after the municipality filed for bankruptcy. The city emerged from bankruptcy protection in February 2015. Silva, who is not married, was arrested by FBI agents Thursday morning at the camp and released on $20,000 bond later in the day.  His next court date is Aug. 18. If convicted of the charges, he could face up to three years in prison. ",politicsNews,"August 4, 2016 ",1
Obama warns Trump not to spread details of security briefings,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama confirmed on Thursday that Donald Trump will get national security briefings ahead of the November election, but he warned the Republican candidate, whom he has called unfit for office, that information from the meetings must be kept secret. Obama, a Democrat who endorsed his former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 White House race, has made clear his dismay over Trump, a New York businessman who has proposed temporarily banning Muslims from entering the United States and building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. On Tuesday Obama questioned why leading Republicans have not withdrawn their support for their presidential nominee. On Thursday he dismissed as ridiculous Trumps claims that the election may be rigged. Of course the elections will not be rigged. What does that mean? Obama said with exasperation. If Mr. Trump is up 10 or 15 points on Election Day and ends up losing, then maybe he can raise some questions. That doesnt seem to be the case at the moment. Trump is trailing Clinton in polls. Despite his disdain, Obama said Trump would get the top secret briefings on world crises and security threats to which he, Clinton and their respective vice presidential running mates are entitled. Some Republicans have said Clinton should be denied access to such briefings because of her handling of classified material on a private email server while she was secretary of state.  Obama on Thursday, speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, made clear that both candidates would be treated equally. We are going to go by the law, which is that, in both tradition and the law, that if somebody is the nominee ... they need to get a security briefing so that if they were to win, they are not starting from scratch in terms of being prepared, Obama said. What I will say is that they have been told these are classified briefings, he added, in response to a question about whether he was concerned about Trump obtaining the classified information. And if they want to be president, they got to start acting like president, and that means being able to receive these briefings and not spread them around. Trump has placed blame on Clinton and Obama for the rise of Islamic State, also known as ISIS. The Obama-Clinton foreign policy gave rise to ISIS, made Iran flush with cash, and is now admitting vast numbers of refugees and migrants into the United States from some of the most volatile regions in the world, Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said in a statement. But none of this is surprising from an Administration that allowed its Secretary of State to threaten the country with a private email server, delete her records, and lie about it to us all, Miller said. Obama, who was meeting with his national security advisers about the fight against Islamic State, also made a subtle jab at Trump for his dispute with a Muslim couple whose U.S. Army captain son died in Iraq. Obama lauded patriotic Muslim Americans who fight in the U.S. armed forces. ",politicsNews,"August 4, 2016 ",1
"Amid campaign turmoil, Trump allies urge him to get back on track","WASHINGTON/PORTLAND, Me. (Reuters) - Supporters of Republican Donald Trump urged him to get back on message on Thursday after a week of dropping opinion poll numbers and a war of words with ranking Republicans over his U.S. presidential campaign. In response to the criticism, Trump pledged to focus more on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, who emerged from last weeks Democratic National Convention with a lead in the polls and who has been consistently attacking him as temperamentally unfit for the presidency. At a rally in Portland, Maine, on Thursday, Trump kept his attention on trying to undermine Clintons candidacy. He said the fact that she has moved past a scandal over her use of a private email server as President Barack Obamas secretary of state was probably the greatest accomplishment that she has ever had in politics. Since formally accepting the Republican nomination two weeks ago, Trump has exasperated many supporters by getting bogged down in a public spat with the parents of an American soldier killed in Iraq and some fellow Republicans. Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross said he still backed Trump, but urged him to stop engaging in exchanges that benefit the Democrats and make the real estate moguls behavior the issue in the campaign. This election is Donalds to lose and so far the Democrats have been clever about baiting him and he generally has bitten, Ross said in an email to Reuters late on Wednesday. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who has endorsed Trump but has not received a reciprocal endorsement from the New York businessman in his re-election bid, told WTAQ radio host Jerry Bader in Green Bay, Wisconsin, that Trump has had a pretty strange run since the convention. You would think we ought to be focusing on Hillary Clinton, on all of her deficiencies. She is such a weak candidate that one would think wed be on offense against Hillary Clinton, and it is distressing that thats not what were talking about these days, he said. Michael Caputo, a former Trump adviser who still supports him, said Trump still has time to right the ship. Staying on message is absolutely key, Caputo told Reuters. After 30 years of speaking his mind, Mr. Trump has to understand that the general election for president of the United States is all about staying on message. Actor and director Clint Eastwood, a prominent celebrity supporter of the Republican Party who appeared at its 2012 U.S. presidential nominating convention, offered an alternative view, saying Trump says some dumb things but that Americans should get over it. Hes onto something because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness, kissing up, the acclaimed actor and director told Esquire magazine. Thats the kiss-ass generation were in right now. At the same time, Trumps lukewarm support for the NATO alliance drew criticism from 37 national security experts from both Democratic and Republican administrations. We find Trumps comments to be reckless, dangerous, and extremely unwise, they wrote in a statement. Obama, at a Pentagon news conference, dismissed Trumps statements that the election could be rigged against him. Of course, the elections will not be rigged, he said. Trumps rough patch has contributed to a dip in support in some battleground states. A WBUR/MassINCpoll in New Hampshire showed Clinton leading Trump, 47 percent to 32 percent. Other polls showed Trump down 11 percentage points to Clinton in Pennsylvania and 6 percentage points in Florida, two states that are important to his chances of winning the election. Trumps troubles are emboldening Democrats to think big. Speaking with reporters after a Clinton campaign event in Las Vegas, U.S. Senator Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, said he believed traditionally Republican-leaning states such as Arizona and Georgia are going to be competitive this election, and he expects Clinton to campaign there. In Portland, some people at Trumps rally said the candidate should stop getting distracted. I dont like how he gets off track, said Bill Devine, 65, of Bath, Maine. He needs to stay focused on his campaign. Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort told CBSs This Morning that the campaign is comfortable where it stands now and said the news media have built a false narrative in which Democrats are controlling the race to the Nov. 8 election. Manafort said that Trumps dropping poll numbers were expected and that he expected the numbers to even out soon. The framework of this election favors Donald Trump. If we run the campaign that we plan on running, we think were going to win, he said.  Concern about Trump has spilled into at least one congressional race. U.S. Representative Mike Coffman, a Colorado Republican, has released a campaign ad in his own re-election bid promising to stand up to Trump if Trump is elected. People ask me, What do you think about Trump? Honestly, I dont care for him much. And I certainly dont trust Hillary, Coffman said in the ad. U.S. Representative Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican, told MSNBC he could not endorse Trump because of all these unforced errors that Trump was making. It just seems that hes, at times, hell-bent on losing a very winnable election to a very seriously flawed candidate: Hillary Clinton, Dent said. ",politicsNews,"August 4, 2016 ",1
"In slap at Trump, some wealthy Republicans campaign for Clinton","NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Groups of wealthy Republicans unhappy with Donald Trump have been privately courting prominent peers to join them in backing Democrat Hillary Clintons U.S. presidential bid, several people involved in the effort told Reuters. They say they are seeking money and endorsements from other Republicans disillusioned by Trump, their partys candidate for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Some have received encouragement from Clinton and members of her campaign staff.  I made the decision that I wouldnt be able to look at my grandkids if I voted for Trump, said Dan Webb, a former federal prosecutor and a self-described Republican for decades working to win over prominent Republican business people in Chicago. Trump, a New York developer making his first run at public office, has made traditional Republican donors uneasy with inflammatory statements about women, Mexicans, Muslims and war veterans, among others.  Big-name Wall Street donors can make a difference for Clinton. They could inject big money into a campaign. They might influence moderate Republicans to switch sides. Their support of Clinton challenges Trumps assertion that his business successes make him a better candidate for president. With the political conventions barely over, the Republican effort to fundraise for Clinton is at an early stage. Some of the groups have yet to receive contributions because they must still file paperwork under campaign finance rules. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks declined to comment for this story. Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson said business leaders are supporting Clinton because of her economic plan and because Trump cannot be trusted to lead our economy. Groups formed to support Clinton include Republicans for Her 2016, run by Republican lobbyist Craig Snyder; a grassroots organization called R4C16, led by John Stubbs and Ricardo Reyes,  officials in former President George W. Bushs administration; and the Republican Women for Hillary group co-led by Jennifer Pierotti Lim, an official at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  The first two groups are acting independently of Clintons own effort. The third is acting in concert with her campaign. We wanted to go out there and be the voice for Republicans who were feeling wary about Trump and weird about publicly endorsing Hillary, said Pierotti Lim, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention at the Clinton teams invitation. Webb, a partner at law firm Winston & Strawn, said he began his outreach after being approached by billionaire investor J.B. Pritzker and longtime Clinton associate Lanny Davis. Pritzker and Davis could not be reached for comment. On Wednesday, billionaire hedge fund manager Seth Klarman said he would work to get Clinton elected because of comments by Trump he found shockingly unacceptable. Although Klarman, who is the president and chief executive of The Baupost Group, is a registered independent, a review of filings shows his political giving has largely benefited Republicans over the years, including some of Trumps rivals in the state-by-state nominating contests this year. Jim Cicconi, a former Reagan and George H.W. White House staff member and lifelong Republican, said he went public with his decision to support Clinton to encourage others in my situation to do the same thing. I feel like I need to do something more than quietly pulling the lever, he said. Im willing to assist the campaign in any way that they want me to help.  Spearheading in part the Clinton effort to woo Republicans on Wall Street is Democratic strategist Leslie Dach, a former Walmart executive and aide to Bill Clinton, sources close to the Clinton campaign said.  People familiar with the Clinton drive say the Democratic nominee herself has spoken to Republican business leaders, including Hewlett Packard Enterprise Chief Executive Meg Whitman, who endorsed Clinton on Tuesday. Clinton deputies courted former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg ahead of a rousing speech he gave at last months Democratic National Convention that urged Wall Street to support her. Whether Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire media mogul and an erstwhile Republican, will play a role in courting other Republican business leaders has yet to be determined, a source close to the discussions said. While some major donors are hesitant to back Trump, the candidate over the last month has pulled in millions of dollars in small-money donations to boost total contributions to more than $80 million for Trumps campaign and the Republican Party, nearly matching Clintons $90 million haul during the same period.

Former U.S. security officials call Trump comments 'disgraceful',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of former U.S. national security officials, including some who have worked for top Republicans, called Donald Trumps recent comments about NATO, Russias annexation of Crimea and other matters disgraceful in a letter released on Thursday. In the last month, the Republican presidential nominee has suggested he might not defend NATO allies if they did not spend more on defense, appeared to invite Russia to hack the emails of Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton and suggested he might accept Russias 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. These are disgraceful statements that betray our longstanding values and national interests embraced by presidents of both parties, said the open letter first reported by The Washington Post. Most of the 37 who signed the letter appear to be Democrats, including Madeleine Albright and Leon Panetta, respectively former secretaries of state and defense, but others served under Republican presidents and lawmakers. Among these, John Bellinger was State Department legal adviser for former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Randy Scheunemann, a neoconservative political operative, was foreign policy advisor to Republican John McCains presidential campaign. Other signatories included former career diplomats Tom Pickering, Bill Burns, Nicholas Burns and Marc Grossman, all of whom served as undersecretary of state for political affairs, effectively the third-ranking U.S. diplomat.   The letter is the latest in a series from former national security officials dismayed at the thought of a Trump presidency. In March, more than 90 Republican foreign policy veterans, including former Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick, signed a letter pledging to oppose Trump and saying his proposals would undermine U.S. security.

House Speaker Ryan: No point in lame duck vote on TPP deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday that he saw no point in bringing up the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal for a vote in any lame duck session of Congress later this year after November elections, because we dont have the votes. As long as we dont have the votes, I see no point in bringing up an agreement only to defeat it, Ryan, a Republican, said in an interview with Wisconsin Public Radio.  Despite both U.S. presidential candidates bashing the 12-country Pacific trade deal on the campaign trail, Obama administration officials have pledged to make a major push in coming months to persuade the Republican-majority Congress to pass TPP.  Backed by dozens of business and industry groups, officials  from the U.S. Commerce Department, the U.S. Trade Representatives office and the White House say they are continuing to talk with individual lawmakers about the merits of the deal, including its consequences for U.S. leadership in Asia.  But Ryan said the Obama administration had negotiated a deal that cost them dozens of votes in Congress, and said the Democratic president needed to renegotiate some components. The speaker said some agricultural and labor provisions needed fixing, and he also believed the deal would reduce intellectual property rights for biologic drugs and pharmaceuticals. For U.S. drugmakers the deal could reduce the patent protection period to eight years from the current 12. Senator Orrin Hatch, the influential Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has also raised this as a major problem with the deal. They have to fix this agreement and renegotiate some pieces of it if they have any hope or chance of passing it, Ryan said in the radio interview, but added that he was doubtful this could happen. I dont see how theyll ever get the votes for it. ",politicsNews,"August 4, 2016 ",1
Investor Wilbur Ross urges Trump not to let his behavior become the issue,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross stood behind Republican Donald Trump but urged him to stop engaging in exchanges that benefit the Democrats and make the real estate moguls behavior the issue in the U.S. presidential campaign.  This election is Donalds to lose and so far the Democrats have been clever about baiting him and he generally has bitten, Ross said in an email to Reuters late on Wednesday. Ross said Trumps reaction in recent days to criticism by the parents of a Muslim U.S. Army captain killed in the Iraq war has enabled the Democrats to turn the table and instead of the behavior of the quintessential Washington insider being the issue he is in danger of letting the Democrats make his behavior be the issue. Ross added, I assume this will change soon. A spokeswoman for Trump did not respond to requests for comment. Ross, who has made billions of dollars betting on bankruptcies and distressed assets, is a critic of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintons trade views. The comments by Ross are the latest by Republican politicians and supporters expressing concern over the Trump campaign ahead of the Nov. 8 election against Clinton. Groups of wealthy Republicans unhappy with Trump have been privately courting prominent peers to join them in backing Clinton.  Meg Whitman, a prominent Republican fundraiser, endorsed Clinton on Tuesday. ",politicsNews,"August 4, 2016 ",1
Obama administration denies Iran cash payment was a ransom,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration said on Wednesday that $400 million in cash paid to Iran soon after the release of five Americans detained by Tehran was not ransom as some Republicans have charged. The five, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, were released on Jan. 16 in exchange for seven Iranians held in the United States for sanctions violations. The prisoner deal coincided with the lifting of international sanctions against Tehran. At the time, the United States said it had settled a longstanding Iranian claim at the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in The Hague, releasing $400 million in funds frozen since 1981, plus $1.3 billion in interest that was owed to Iran. The funds were part of a trust fund Iran used before its 1979 Islamic Revolution to buy U.S. military equipment that was tied up for decades in litigation at the tribunal. Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, on Wednesday sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry asking him to appear at a future committee hearing to discuss the payment.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest rejected suggestions the money transfer to Iran was ransom or a secret.   The United States, under President Obama, has not paid a ransom to secure the release of Americans unjustly detained in Iran and were not going to pay a ransom, he said in response to a Wall Street Journal article that said Washington secretly organized the cash airlift.  Earnest said Republicans, who have long opposed the Iran nuclear deal, are seizing on how the money was paid to Iran as a way to undermine the deal. Theyre struggling to justify their opposition to our engagement with Iran, he told a briefing. While there have long been questions about the timing of the payment, one Iranian concern was that the Obama administration could face too much domestic political criticism if it delayed acting on the tribunals decision. Due to international sanctions against Iran, the payment, made in euros, Swiss francs and other currencies, had to be made in cash, U.S. officials argue. One U.S. official said the $1.3 billion in interest was paid to Iran through the U.S. Treasury-administered Judgment Fund, which is used to pay awards against the United States. Senior officials at the Justice Department had objected to sending cash on a plane to Iran at the same time that Iran was releasing four imprisoned Americans (the fifth American was released separately) but were overruled by the State Department, The Wall Street Journal reported in a separate story on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the discussions. People knew what it was going to look like, and there was concern the Iranians probably did consider it a ransom payment, the newspaper quoted one of the people as saying. Justice Department prosecutors were also concerned that the United States would release too many Iranian convicts and drop too many pending criminal cases against people suspected of violating sanctions laws, the second Wall Street Journal report said. Reuters was unable to independently verify the report. In response to the report, a Department of Justice spokesman said in a statement: The Department of Justice fully supported the ultimate outcome of the Administrations resolution of several issues with Iran, including Hague settlement efforts, as well as the return of U.S. citizens detained in Iran. We will not comment further on internal interagency deliberations. A senior State Department official also responded by saying that the payment had been fully an interagency decision and that any idea that the State Department had the power to overrule was false. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump blamed his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state during Obamas first term, for launching the talks with Iran. Our incompetent Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, was the one who started talks to give 400 million dollars, in cash, to Iran. Scandal! Trump said in a Twitter post. The chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus, also weighed in. The Obama-Clinton foreign policy not only means cutting a dangerous nuclear deal with the worlds number one state sponsor of terrorism, it also means paying them a secret ransom with cargo planes full of cash, he said. House Speaker Paul Ryan was more measured, saying, If true, this report confirms our longstanding suspicion that the administration paid a ransom in exchange for Americans unjustly detained in Iran.

Fury at top of Republican Party over Trump snub of House speaker,"WASHINGTON/JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (Reuters) - Donald Trumps White House campaign was in turmoil on Wednesday after he angered senior Republican Party leaders by criticizing a dead soldiers family and refusing to back the re-election campaign of House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan. On Tuesday, Trump denied support to both Ryan and Senator John McCain in their coming primary contests, hitting back at critics in the Republican leadership who have taken him to task for his insistent public dispute with the parents of the soldier, a Muslim U.S. Army captain killed in the Iraq war.  Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus was furious over the failure to endorse Ryan, who is the most senior elected Republican, and over Trumps feud with the Khan family, two Republican sources said. He feels like a fool, a Republican source familiar with the situation said of Priebus. The RNC did not respond to a request for comment about Priebus.  Another Republican source said Trumps family members, who have played an influential role in his campaign, were aware that an intervention was needed to get Trump back on track. One idea being floated was to have a senior adviser travel with Trump to help him stay on message. More than any other major figure in the Republican establishment, Priebus worked to bring Trump into the partys fold despite the New York businessmans status as an outsider. Trump, who had never previously run for public office, beat 16 rivals to become the Republican presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election. Ahead of last months Republican Party Convention, the RNC chairman sought to rally the fractured party behind Trump. Priebus feels burned by Trumps string of self-inflicted wounds and his refusal to observe basic decorum by giving Ryan his support. But in what appeared to be an effort to soothe ruffled feelings, Trumps vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, said on Wednesday he endorsed Ryan as a strong conservative leader and was doing so with Trumps blessing. The Indiana governor told Fox News that it takes time to build relationships in politics and that was exactly what Trump and Ryan were doing.  Trump has had a running dispute with the parents of Army Captain Humayun Khan since they took the stage at last weeks Democratic National Convention. Khizr Khan, with his wife, Ghazala, standing by his side, cited the sacrifice of their son, who was killed by a car bomb in 2004, and criticized Trumps proposal to combat terrorism by temporarily banning Muslims from entering the United States. Many Republican leaders, including Ryan and McCain, have criticized Trumps subsequent attacks on the parents. Even longtime ally Chris Christie, the Republican New Jersey governor, said it was inappropriate to attack the Khans. Trumps feud with the Khans was the final straw for Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger, a former Air Force pilot and Iraq war veteran. Kinzinger, who had held off supporting Trump, told CNN on Wednesday: I just dont see how I get to Donald Trump anymore. Trump, who made his comments about Ryan and McCain in an interview with The Washington Post, shrugged off the backlash. There is great unity in my campaign, perhaps greater than ever before. I want to thank everyone for your tremendous support. Beat Crooked H! he wrote on Twitter early on Wednesday, referring to his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Campaign manager Paul Manafort told Fox News the campaign was moving in a positive direction, with Trump himself in control. The campaign is in very good shape. We are organized. We are moving forward, Manafort said. In Daytona, Florida, Trump said the news medias coverage of him was dishonest. Were doing quite well despite the fact that we get a totally false narrative, he told supporters at a rally. At another campaign event in Florida, in Jacksonville, Trump pointed out a group of families, known as Gold Star families, who have lost loved ones in war, calling them incredible people. He didnt mention the spat with the Khans. Trumps always unruly campaign has been mired in disorder in recent days. On Monday, Trump fired Ed Brookover, a senior adviser hired as a liaison between the campaign and the RNC. Ryan, who is favored to win next week in his race against primary challenger Paul Nehlen, appeared to be trying to ignore the snub from Trump. An aide to the speaker said he would not have time to meet Trump later this week, when Trump is expected to be campaigning in Wisconsin, Ryans home state. The aide did not indicate whether anyone had requested a get-together of Trump and Ryan, but when asked whether they might meet to patch things up, the aide told Reuters, The speaker has a full schedule  cant back out of previous commitments in the (congressional) district. A Republican congressional aide said there was deep frustration on Capitol Hill that Trump keeps engaging in petty spats. The aide said congressional offices that support Trump got two sets of talking points on Monday from the campaign about the Khan situation but have not heard anything from the campaign about Trumps Ryan comments. The dissent over the Trump campaign also took other turns. Late on Tuesday, Meg Whitman, a prominent Republican fundraiser and chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE.N), endorsed Clintons White House bid, calling Trump an authoritarian character and a threat to democracy. In better news for Trump, his campaign and the RNC jointly raised $80 million for his White House bid in July, the campaign said on Wednesday. That was less than the $90 million Clinton raised along with the national Democratic Party the same month, but it was a substantial bump from past months. A former reality TV star, Trump has won support particularly from white blue-collar workers who feel neglected by the political establishment. Along with his proposed ban on Muslims, his plans have included building a wall along the Mexican border to keep out illegal immigrants and renegotiating trade agreements. Opinion polls have shown Clinton benefiting from a boost after her partys convention last week. The RealClearPolitics average of recent national polls put her 4.5 percentage points ahead of Trump, at 46.5 percent to 42 percent. The Detroit Economic Club, where candidates usually appear to give major economic addresses, said Trump would speak at the club on Monday. ",politicsNews,"August 3, 2016 ",1
Clinton extends lead over Trump to 8 percentage points: Reuters/Ipsos,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton extended her lead over Republican rival Donald Trump to eight percentage points, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, from six points on Friday. The bump for Clinton followed the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia last week at which Clinton and her supporters painted an optimistic portrait of America, and came amid controversy over Trumps comments about the parents of a slain Muslim U.S. soldier. About 43 percent of likely voters favor Clinton, 35 percent favor Trump, and 9 percent picked Other, according to the July 28-Aug. 1 online poll of 1,289 likely voters. The poll had a credibility interval of 3 percentage points.  Trump has faced a barrage of criticism in recent days from political allies as well as opponents after he criticized the parents of U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq in 2004. The father, Khizr Khan, had harsh words for Trump at the Democratic convention where he spoke on Thursday night, saying the 70-year-old businessman and former reality TV star had sacrificed nothing and no one and railing against his calls to ban Muslim immigrants. Trump responded saying Khan viciously attacked him, and suggested the man was repeating lines fed to him by the Clinton campaign. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who dropped out of the Republican presidential primary race and endorsed Trump, said on Tuesday that Trumps criticisms of the Khans was inappropriate. House Republican Richard Hanna of New York said it was not enough to simply denounce his (Trumps) comments, and said he would support former Secretary of State Clinton instead. Trump had a short-lived bump in the polls after the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in late July, when Reuters polling showed him slightly ahead of Clinton for the first time since May.

Obama cuts short prison sentences for 214 convicts,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama cut short the prison terms of 214 convicts on Wednesday, the largest number of commutations a U.S. leader has granted in single day since at least 1900, the White House said. Obama has now granted a total of 562 commutations during his presidency, more than the number by the past nine presidents combined, it said. In Wednesdays batch, 67 convicts were serving life sentences. The convicts were serving time for crimes including possession of crack cocaine and methamphetamine, with intent to distribute. Some were imprisoned on charges of gun possession.  One of the convicts, James Wright of Baltimore, Maryland, was serving a 20 year sentence that began in 2006 for possession of crack with intent to distribute. He will be released in December. Obama has worked to reform the U.S. criminal justice system and reduce the number of people serving long sentences for nonviolent drug offences. It is a rare issue on which Obama gets support from Republican lawmakers. For years crack offenders faced stiffer penalties than powder cocaine offenders, even though the substances are similar at the molecular level. Critics have said the disparity has unfairly harmed minority and poor communities.   In 2014, Obama announced the most ambitious clemency program in 40 years, inviting thousands of drug offenders and other convicts to seek early release. But the program has struggled under a flood of unprocessed cases.  Our work is far from finished, White House counsel Neil Eggleston said about the commutations. Eggleston urged Congress to take action. While we continue to work to act on as many clemency applications as possible, only legislation can bring about lasting change to the federal system, he said. The program automatically expires when Obama leaves office next January and it is uncertain whether the next president would continue with a similar plan. Donald Trump, the Republican candidate in the Nov. 8 election, has championed law and order in his campaign. Democrat Hillary Clinton has called for criminal justice reform.

Clinton campaign studying alternative to U.S. ethanol mandate,"WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clintons campaign has solicited advice from California regulators on how to revamp a federal regulation requiring biofuels like corn-based ethanol be blended into the nations gasoline supply, according to campaign and state officials.  The move is the clearest sign yet that, if elected, Clinton would seek to adjust the regulation, called the Renewable Fuel Standard, possibly hurting her chances in corn-growing states like Iowa where she faces a tough battle against Republican rival Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election. The Renewable Fuel Standard, created by Congress in 2005, mandates that transportation fuel sold in the United States contain a minimum volume of renewable fuels. It was intended to cut greenhouse gas emissions and expand the U.S. renewable fuels sector while lowering reliance on imported oil. It is opposed by the oil industry and environmentalists and has been criticized as a mere subsidy to corn producers.  Clinton advisers have contacted the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to discuss whether a policy like Californias Low Carbon Fuel Standard, a market-based system rather than a mandate, could be applied at a national level to replace or augment the Renewable Fuel Standard, and other issues, CARB officials said. Mary Nichols, head of the CARB, said she discussed the states regulations with Clinton advisers. While a backer of the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Nichols said she told Clintons advisers they could avoid political backlash by focusing on other carbon-reduction strategies instead, such as expanding electric vehicle sales and cleaning up emissions from coal-fired electricity. Nichols did not provide further details on the discussions. A Clinton campaign official, who asked not to be named, confirmed the discussions with CARB but gave no further details.  A campaign spokesman, Tyrone Gayle, said the campaign has been seeking advice from a diverse set of stakeholders. He added that the Clinton campaign does not support replacing the RFS with a national low-carbon fuel standard but did not elaborate. Former Obama administration climate and energy adviser Heather Zichal said on the sidelines of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia last week that the Renewable Fuel Standard was broken, but that a Clinton administration could make modifications to fix it. Mandates arent necessarily a perfect way to regulate, Zichal said at the event. The U.S. corn lobby hopes to convince both Clinton and Trump to uphold the regulation, which requires a doubling of U.S. biofuels use to 36 billion gallons per year by 2022, when congressionally mandated volume targets are set to expire. The program is designed to last indefinitely after that. Environmentalists, anti-hunger activists and the oil sector have called for the rule to be repealed or changed because they say it raises food and fuel costs without delivering the emissions reductions that it was intended to achieve. MARKET-BASED SYSTEM The California regulation, a key part of the states effort to combat climate change, requires a 10 percent reduction in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by 2020, but leaves it up to companiesto decide how to reach that target.  California enacted the Low Carbon Fuel Standard in 2007 targeting oil refiners and distributors that sell in the states market. It angered Midwestern ethanol interests because the regulation counts the carbon dioxide footprint of transporting biofuels into the state for blending, effectively blocking many of those imports. Oil companies have complained that the regulation is costly. Clinton in May expressed support for the federal Renewable Fuel Standard in an opinion piece published in an Iowa newspaper, but said it could be improved. Clintons openness to overhauling the Renewable Fuel Standard appears to contrast with Trumps position. During the state-by-state battle for the Republican presidential nomination, Trump said he supported the biofuel mandates set out in the Renewable Fuel Standard. Corn and ethanol industry lobbyists said they have been talking with both the Clinton and Trump campaigns to argue in favor of the Renewable Fuel Standard. ",politicsNews,"August 3, 2016 ",1
Muslim families of fallen U.S. soldiers driven to oppose Trump,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nazar Naqvi has faithfully voted Republican for more than three decades.  After Donald Trumps feud with Muslim parents who lost a son in battle for the United States, he has vowed not a single Republican will get his vote. Naqvi, 69, a retired U.S. government engineer from Newburgh, New York, is a member of a small community of Muslims who are among Americas Gold Star families, those whose loved ones were killed while serving in the U.S. military.  His son Mohsin Naqvi, who was born in Pakistan, enlisted in the U.S. Army four days after Sept. 11, 2001, and was killed in 2008 by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. Trump lashed out at Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the Pakistani American parents of slain U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, after they appeared at last weeks Democratic convention in Philadelphia to criticize the Republican presidential hopeful for proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country.  Im going to vote for anyone but Republicans because of this one person, this man who has gone out of his mind, Naqvi said this week. Not any office should get our vote. He has been nominated not by one person - the Republican Party nominated him. Naqvi said he was pressing his registered Republican friends to do the same.     The Pentagon says that 3,939 active duty service members have identified themselves as Muslim, less than 1 percent of the 1.3 million active duty U.S. military troops, but a Pentagon spokesman said there is no record of how many Muslims have been killed in action. Reuters reached out to a dozen Muslim Gold Star families who lost a loved one in action after Sept. 11, 2001. The families are not organized as a group and some did not  want to talk. But those who did agreed that Trumps comments upended their political loyalties, and moved them to take action to register and motivate other voters to keep Trump out of the White House in November. Nooshin Razani, 43, an Iranian-American pediatrician in Oakland, California, whose 19-year-old brother Omead Razani died while serving as a U.S. Army medic in Iraq in 2004, said Trumps comments sparked her to speak to the press for the first time. When I saw there was this person who was willing to use religion in this negative way, I decided Im coming forward, said Razani. Trump rebuked Khizr Khan for suggesting that he should read the U.S. Constitution and said his wife Ghazala may have stood silently by her husband because she might not have been allowed to speak. Although Trump did call their son a hero and said his aim was to end radical Islamic terror, the ensuing uproar has caused many Republicans to distance themselves from him and to support the Khan family.     Razani joined more than 20 Gold Star families in signing an open letter calling for Trump to apologize to the Khans and said she is going to volunteer to register voters, mainly because of Trumps comments about Ghazala Khan, which she said insulted all Muslim women. I want to be an active part of making sure peoples voices are heard. Even people Trump thinks dont speak up, Razani said. Trumps ongoing dispute with the Khans has become a call to political action for Kevin Ahearn of Phoenix. His brother, Army Major James Ahearn, converted to Islam to marry a woman with whom he fell in love in Iraq, brought to the United States and with whom he had a daughter before he was killed by a bomb in Iraq in 2007.  Kevin Ahearn, 48, said on Tuesday that he and his husband planned to go to Democratic Headquarters in Phoenix to volunteer for the first time. It makes me all the more determined that he does not make it to the White House, said Ahearn, whose Muslim niece now is 10. The soldiers mother said she was shocked by Trumps rhetoric and wishes she could talk to her late son about it. He was always a staunch Republican because they backed the military. I cant imagine how he would feel now, said Constance Ahearn, 75, who lives in the San Francisco area. ",politicsNews,"August 3, 2016 ",1
Trump campaign says it raised $80 million in July: statement,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps campaign took in $80 million last month, leaving it with $74 million in cash on hand ahead of the Nov. 8 election, it said in a statement released on Wednesday. Of the $80 million raised in July, $64 million was from donations that included matching donations from Trump, it said.

"Republican rift widens as Trump declines to endorse Ryan, McCain","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ratcheted up tensions in his party on Tuesday by denying two leading figures, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator John McCain, support in their re-election bids. Trump told The Washington Post in an interview that he could endorse neither Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican, nor McCain, a U.S. senator from Arizona and a former Republican presidential nominee, as they face challenges in their states primary contests ahead of the Nov. 8 general election. Both Ryan and McCain had criticized Trumps feud with the family of Army Captain Humayun Khan, who died in the line of duty in Iraq in 2004 and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for bravery after his death. The discord comes just two weeks after the Republican National Convention in Cleveland that formally nominated Trump for president. It is the latest rift in a party already frayed by internal dissent over its standard bearer, seen in stark relief at the convention where McCain was among high-level party members who essentially snubbed Trump by choosing not to attend. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, and former presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush also did not attend the convention. Trump has had a running dispute with Khizr and Ghazala Khan since they took the stage at last weeks Democratic convention to cite their sons sacrifice and criticize Trumps proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States. The uproar has led many Republicans to distance themselves from Trump and voice support for the Khan family.    Trump, mirroring the language Ryan used about supporting the nominee before his eventual endorsement, told the newspaper he was not quite there yet on endorsing Ryan in next Tuesdays Wisconsin primary, and that he had never been there with McCain, who will be on the ballot in primary elections in Arizona later this month. McCain had a very friendly meeting with Trumps vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, on Tuesday in Arizona, where Pence was visiting, a McCain spokeswoman said. Trump said Ryan had sought his endorsement, but that as of now he is only giving it very serious consideration. Ryans campaign office quickly responded that neither Speaker Ryan nor anyone on his team has ever asked for Donald Trumps endorsement.  And we are confident in a victory next week regardless, campaign spokesman Zack Roday said in a statement.   Ryan is favored to win against primary challenger Paul Nehlen, who Trump praised as running a very good campaign. In a mid-July survey by Harper Polling, Ryan was ahead of Nehlen by nearly 50 points. Trump, a former reality TV star, has troubled many in the Republican establishment with his off-the-cuff, often insulting style, and controversial policies, including the proposed ban on Muslims and his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep out illegal immigrants. President Barack Obama on Tuesday blasted Trump as unfit to be president and questioned why any Republican would support the New York businessman, who is seeking his first public office. The question I think that they have to ask themselves is, if you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable: Why are you still endorsing him? Obama, a Democrat, said at a White House news conference with Singapores prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong. The chorus of complaints against Trump grew on Tuesday. Representative Richard Hanna of New York became the first Republican in Congress to endorse Democratic nominee Hillary, although several other Republicans in Congress have said they will not support Trump. Hanna, who is retiring from the House of Representatives rather than seek re-election, said his decision was prompted by Trumps attacks on the Khan family. He called Trump deeply flawed in endless ways, unrepentant and self-involved. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Trump ally once viewed by Trump as a potential running mate, called criticisms of the Khan family inappropriate. Trumps son Eric told CBS News on Tuesday that his fathers comments about the Khans have been blown hugely out of proportion. Trump has fallen behind Clinton in opinion polls made public since the parties held their nominating conventions last month. Clinton extended her lead over Trump to 8 percentage points, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, from 6 points on Friday. About 43 percent of likely voters favor Clinton, 35 percent favor Trump, and 9 percent picked other. Trump also has trailed Clinton in fundraising. Clinton reported raising nearly $90 million in July for her campaign and the Democratic Party, with more than half the donations coming from new donors. Interviewed on the Fox Business television network, Trump brushed off billionaire investor Warren Buffetts blistering critique of his business acumen. Buffett, chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, scorned Trumps 1995 move to list Trump hotels and casino resorts on the New York Stock Exchange, saying the business lost money for the next decade and that a monkey would have outperformed Trumps company. Trump, who has said his business success qualifies him to lead the country, defended his record running his hotel and casino business in Atlantic City, New Jersey. I had great timing. I got out, after seven years, he told the network  on Tuesday. I took a lot of money out of Atlantic City, which is what Im supposed to do. Im a businessperson. ",politicsNews,"August 2, 2016 ",1
Tea Party Republican Huelskamp loses re-election bid for U.S. House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Representative Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, a Tea Party favorite who often feuded with Republican leaders in the U.S. House, lost his bid for re-election in the partys primary contest, unofficial state results showed on Wednesday. Huelskamp, who was seeking a fourth term, won just 44 percent of Tuesdays vote in losing to political newcomer Roger Marshall, a physician who took 57 percent, according to the Kansas secretary of states website. Marshall said Huelskamp had become an ineffective player in Washington after losing key committee positions in a stand-off with Republican leaders. Conservative political action committees spent heavily this year to defeat Huelskamp and support Marshall, who also was backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Huelskamp comes from a Kansas farm family and was elected to Congress in 2010 amid a wave of support from the Tea Party movement, which promotes smaller government and reduced federal spending and taxation. He repeatedly tangled with his House Republican leaders in pushing for a more conservative fiscal agenda.  Huelskamp was a prominent member of the Freedom Caucus of House conservatives who have riled House Republican leadership. His battles with former House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner left him stripped of his House Budget and Agriculture Committee memberships, a blow to his farm-rich state. Voters are looking for results from their Reps, not obstructionism, the Chamber of Commerces political wing said in a tweet after the vote, calling Marshall an effective conservative. Huelskamp, in a post on Facebook overnight, said the race showed how big money from Washington power brokers had defeated Kansas values.  It is now perfectly clear, he wrote, that the Establishment wing of the Republican party cannot stand conservatives, he wrote. Marshall will face Libertarian candidate Kerry Burt in the Nov. 8 general election. There is no Democratic candidate, according to the Kansas secretary of states website.

Trump campaign asks Capitol Hill to back him in Khan controversy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Donald Trumps presidential campaign appealed to Capitol Hill for support on Monday as his attacks on the Muslim parents of a decorated American soldier killed in Iraq drew sharp rebukes from fellow party members. Trumps criticism of Khizr Khan and Ghazala Khan, who took the stage at last weeks Democratic convention, sparked growing concern and dismay from Republican lawmakers responding to the latest Trump outburst to blindside his party colleagues. Republican Senator John McCain, a former prisoner of war and the most prominent veteran in Congress, along with the commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, joined the chorus of condemnation, reflecting the highly regarded place the military and its veterans hold with many in the United States. Trumps dispute with the Khans has dominated the White House campaign in recent days and underlined the uneasy alliance between many leading Republicans and the partys freewheeling, unorthodox nominee for the Nov. 8 election. Rob Wasinger, a onetime congressional candidate who has been working for the Trump camp on congressional outreach, sent an email to senior Senate aides saying, We want to get several member statements out today on this, and would really appreciate your help. A similar appeal was made to Republicans in the House of Representatives, according to a senior aide. Attached to the appeal were talking points lawmakers could use to try to tamp down the controversy growing since last weeks appearance at the Democratic convention by the Khans, the parents of U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, who was killed by a bomb in Iraq 12 years ago. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, said that the campaign was grateful to have support in Congress and that Republicans are working to keep Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton from winning the presidency. Wasinger refused to comment when contacted by telephone. The appeal did not generate any help for Trump. A senior Senate Republican aide, who asked not to be identified, said Republican senators were pleased with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells statement on Sunday calling Captain Khan an American hero and noting a travel ban on all members of a religion is simply contrary to American values. At the same time, the aide said the controversy would probably not cause Republican senators to withdraw their endorsements of Trump. In a convention speech delivered with his wife at his side, Khizr Khan showcased his sons military service and criticized Trumps call for a temporary ban on Muslims from entering the United States, holding up a copy of the U.S. Constitution and suggesting Trump read it. Since then, Trump has complained he was viciously attacked by the couple and suggested Ghazala Khan might not have been allowed to speak, implying her silence reflected restrictions placed on women by some traditional Muslims.  McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential candidate and current chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued a lengthy statement sharply criticizing Trumps comments. While our party has bestowed upon him the nomination, it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us, said McCain, a prisoner of war for five years during the Vietnam War. His counterpart on the House Armed Services Committee, Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas, echoed McCain, saying in a statement he was dismayed at the attacks Khizr and Ghazala Khan have endured after they spoke about their sons service and sacrifice. The head of the 1.7 million-member Veterans of Foreign Wars also said Trumps attack on the Khans went too far. Trump and Clinton spoke to the groups national convention last week. Election year or not, the VFW will not tolerate anyone berating a Gold Star family member for exercising his or her right of speech or expression, said Brian Duffy, the national commander of the countrys oldest and largest war veterans organization, referring to families who have lost relatives in wars. President Barack Obama did not mention Trump by name, but said military families who had lost loved ones in service should be honored for their sacrifice. No one has given more for our freedom and our security than our Gold Star families, Obama said at the Disabled American Veterans national convention in Atlanta. Our Gold Star families have made a sacrifice that most of us cannot even begin to imagine. They represent the very best of our country. In the talking points sent to lawmakers, the Trump campaign said he had been asked about the Khans comments during the convention and wished them well. The talking points also noted that Trump wants to end radical Islamic terror, so that our soldiers like Mr. Khans son will be safe. The list also says Trump had not directly compared his sacrifices to the Khans. Trump said over the weekend he had also made sacrifices in his life by working hard, creating jobs and being successful. The Khans bristled at that suggestion and, in numerous television appearances over the weekend, said Trump was ignorant about Islam and about their familys sacrifice.   Trumps off-the-cuff insults and controversial proposals such as the Muslim ban and a plan to keep illegal immigrants out by building a wall along the Mexican border, have made many in the party establishment reluctant backers of his White House bid. On Monday, during a town hall event in Columbus, Ohio, Trump told supporters he thought the November election might be rigged. Later that day, he said former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders made a deal with the devil when he agreed to back Clinton. Shes the devil, Trump said, referring to Clinton. In his statement, McCain recalled how Humayun Khan died, saying that when a suicide bomber aimed his vehicle toward a building housing hundreds of U.S. soldiers, the captain told his subordinates to stay away, then ran toward it. McCain thanked the Khans for coming to America, saying your son was the best of America, and the memory of his sacrifice will make us a better nation  and he will never be forgotten.  In a remarks to television networks on Monday, Khizr Khan said Trump lacked the empathy to be a leader and chided him for throwing the first salvo in their exchange. Trump has tried to shift focus from the Khans. This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart! Trump said Monday on Twitter. Ghazala Khan wrote an opinion piece in The Washington Post on Sunday saying she had remained silent during her husbands remarks to cope with making her grief public during the convention. On Sunday, Democratic rival Clinton said Trump had scapegoated the parents. In addition to Senate Majority Leader McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan issued a statement supporting the family.  Trump drew similar opprobrium a year ago when he said McCain, who as a naval aviator was shot down and taken prisoner during the Vietnam War, was not a hero because he had been captured. In an open letter, 23 Gold Star families said Trump cheapened their sacrifice and called for an apology. This goes beyond politics. It is about a sense of decency, it said. That kind decency you mock as political correctness. ",politicsNews,"August 1, 2016 ",1
Obama to Republican leaders: why are you still endorsing Trump?,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama issued a scathing attack of Donald Trump on Tuesday for criticizing a Muslim family whose U.S. Army captain son was killed in Iraq, and he challenged Republican leaders to withdraw support for their unfit nominee. Obamas comments added to a growing number of statements from Republicans and Democrats lambasting Trump for his criticism of Khizr and Ghazala Khan, who appeared at the Democratic National Convention last week. Trump questioned whether Mrs. Khan did not speak at the convention because she was prevented from doing so by her religion and he characterized Mr. Khans criticism of him as vicious. Families who lose sons or daughters who serve in the U.S. military are called Gold Star families. The notion that he would attack a Gold Star family that had made such extraordinary sacrifices on behalf or our country, the fact that he doesnt appear to have basic knowledge around critical issues in Europe, in the Middle East, in Asia means that hes woefully unprepared to do this job, Obama said of Trump during a White House news conference. The Democratic president noted that leading Republicans, including Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, and one-time Republican presidential nominee John McCain, a U.S. senator from Arizona, had criticized Trump for his remarks but have stood by their endorsements of him. The question I think that they have to ask themselves is, if you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him? Obama said.  What does this say about your party that this is your standard-bearer? Obama said. Obama spoke during a White House news conference with Singapores prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong.  Obama has endorsed his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president. Obama said that even if he had lost his White House races in 2008 to McCain and in 2012 to former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, he would not have doubted their abilities to lead the country. That was not the case for Trump, a businessman from New York, Obama said. There has to come a point at which you say, somebody who makes those kinds of statements doesnt have the judgment, the temperament, the understanding to occupy the most powerful position in the world, Obama said.

Trump dismisses Buffett's rebuke over his business judgment,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday brushed off billionaire investor Warren Buffetts blistering critique of his business acumen. I dont care much about Warren Buffett, Trump said on the FOX Business television network Tuesday morning, a day after Buffett lashed out at Trump in a speech at a campaign rally for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Buffett, a widely followed investor who is chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, scorned Trumps 1995 move to list Trump hotels and casino resorts on the New York Stock Exchange, saying it lost money for the next decade and that a monkey would have outperformed Trumps company. He also challenged Trump to release his tax returns, something the real estate mogul and television star has declined to do so far citing an Internal Revenue Service audit. Trump, who has held up his career in business as a qualification to lead the country, defended his record running his hotel and casino business in Atlantic City, New Jersey. I had great timing. I got out, after seven years, he told FOX Business on Tuesday. I took a lot of money out of Atlantic City, which is what Im supposed to do. Im a businessperson.  Trump said he did well in the good times in Atlantic City, but then times started going very bad.  Trump said he used to invest in U.S. stocks but got out because I dont like what Im seeing at all, pointing to U.S. immigration policies, Syrian refugees and what he said were artificially low interest rates. He also vowed to spend twice as much on U.S. infrastructure as Clinton, who has pledged $275 billion on rebuilding the nations crumbling roads and bridges, among other structures. Trump, who has been criticized by fellow Republicans and others for responding too readily to opponents, declined to target Buffett personally for his comments: Theres no counter-punch.  Buffett on Monday vowed to do whatever it takes to get out the vote in his congressional district in Nebraska, including driving voters himself to the polls to cast ballots.  With Clinton by his side, Buffett told the crowd that his final straw was Trumps critical response to the Muslim parents of a decorated U.S. soldier killed by a bomb in Iraq 12 years ago.  Buffett is No. 3 on Forbes magazines list of the richest billionaires, with a net worth calculated at $60.8 billion. ",politicsNews,"August 2, 2016 ",1
Trump loses bid to end Trump University lawsuit before trial,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday rejected Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps pretrial bid to throw out a lawsuit brought by Trump University students who said they were defrauded by its real-estate seminars. U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel said in a written ruling that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Trump knowingly participated in a scheme to cheat the students, who paid up to $35,000 to learn Trumps real estate investing secrets from his hand-picked instructors. Curiel said there was extensive evidence Trump had not personally met, interviewed or selected Trump University instructors. In a July 22 hearing, Curiel tentatively denied the bid by Trump to dismiss the lawsuit in California, one of three over the defunct Trump University venture. Trumps lawyers had argued that the lawsuit, filed in 2013 in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, should be dismissed because the New York real estate mogul, though personally involved in developing the concept and curriculum, relied on others to manage Trump University by the time the plaintiffs purchased seminars. Trumps lawyers claimed that references in marketing materials to secrets, hand-picked instructors or university were sales puffery and there was no evidence Trump intended to defraud students. Separately, Curiel rejected an effort to make public video excerpts of Trump testifying under oath.  Trumps lawyers had fought against the release of the excerpts, saying they would be exploited by the media and others during the presidential campaign. Trump set off an uproar in May when he accused Curiel of being biased against him because of the candidates pledge to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico. Curiel was born in Indiana and is of Mexican descent. ",politicsNews,"August 2, 2016 ",1

Senior Democratic National Committee officials resign: DNC,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three senior officials with the Democratic National Committee have resigned, the DNC said on Tuesday, amid a shake-up following a hack of thousands of emails that embarrassed the party just as it staged its national convention last week. The resignations of DNC Chief Executive Officer Amy Dacey, Communications Director Luis Miranda and Chief Financial Officer Brad Marshall were announced by interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile. Brazile, who took over the role after Debbie Wasserman Schultz stepped down last week, did not mention the hacks or give a reason for the resignations in a statement on the reorganization, but cast the changes as looking ahead to the U.S. general election on Nov. 8. The hack on the DNC emails stirred discord at the start of the partys convention in Philadelphia where Hillary Clinton formally accepted her partys presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election. Some of the emails, which were published by WikiLeaks, showed party officials favoring Clinton over her rival for the nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, during the primary contests. Brazile announced a transition team that she said would help to position the party for the general election and to prepare for an eventual permanent party chair.      Tom McMahon, a former executive director of the DNC, will lead the transition team, the statement said. Chief of Staff Brandon Davis will also continue in that role and will oversee DNC general election efforts, and strategist Doug Thornell will join as a senior adviser on an interim basis, it said. Other Democratic Party systems have also been hacked. The FBI is investigating a cyber attack incident at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC, and a computer network used by Clintons campaign was also hacked. The White House has declined to speculate on who was behind the hack of Democratic Party computers, referring to an ongoing investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Cybersecurity experts and U.S. officials, however, have said they believed Russia engineered the release of the DNC emails to influence the presidential election. Clinton herself has blamed Russia for the hack. Russias foreign ministry has called such accusations  insulting.   ",politicsNews,"August 2, 2016 ",1

Clinton accuses Trump of scapegoating Muslim soldier's parents,"CLEVELAND HEIGHTS, Ohio (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump on Sunday of scapegoating the parents of a Muslim soldier killed in Iraq, after the Republican nominee took issue with remarks the soldiers father made at the Democratic National Convention. Trump, in an ABC interview that aired on Sunday, questioned why Ghazala Khan, mother of U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, stood quietly by her husband, Khizr Khan, as he took the stage at last weeks Democratic convention in Philadelphia. Trump suggested the mother might not have been allowed to speak. Speaking at a church service, Clinton said Trump had been insulting to a family who had sacrificed so much. She also used the episode to contrast her own religious faith with that of Trump, who has spoken of religion on the campaign trail infrequently. I dont begrudge anyone of any other faith or of no faith at all, but I do tremble before those who would scapegoat other Americans, who would insult people because of their religion, their ethnicity, their disability, Clinton said in remarks at the Imani Temple Ministries, an African-American church in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.  Its just not how I was raised, thats not how I was taught in my church, said Clinton, who grew up as a Methodist. Tim Kaine and I are people of faith, she said, referring to her vice presidential running mate, who is a Catholic. Top Republican lawmakers House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also condemned Trumps remarks in separate statements, although they did not mention their presidential candidate by name. Many Muslim Americans have served valiantly in our military, and made the ultimate sacrifice. Captain Khan was one such brave example, Ryan said. His sacrifice - and that of Khizr and Ghazala Khan - should always be honored. Period. he said. Earlier on Sunday, Ghazala Khan took up her own defense in an opinion piece in the Washington Post, saying her husband had asked her in advance whether she would want to speak at the convention but that she had decided she would be unable to do so on stage because of her pain over the 2004 death of her son. Donald Trump said that maybe I wasnt allowed to say anything. That is not true, she wrote. When Donald Trump is talking about Islam, he is ignorant. In a statement issued on Sunday evening by the Trump campaign, Trumps running mate, Mike Pence, said that he and the Republican nominee believe that Captain Humayun Khan is an American hero that his family, like other families of fallen soldiers, should be cherished by every American. But Pence added that Captain Khan had died defending the country against terrorism and that Trumps policies would reduce the likelihood that other families would face the kind of heartbreak the Khans had. Khizr Khan, a U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin and a Muslim, spoke about his war hero son at the Democratic convention and took issue with Trumps call for a temporary ban on the entry of Muslims into the United States. Khizr Khan invited the Republican nominee to read the U.S. Constitution and visit the graves of American soldiers from many backgrounds at Arlington National Cemetery. In the interview aired on Sunday morning on ABCs This Week, Trump cast doubt on why Khans wife did not speak. She was standing there, she had nothing to say, she probably, maybe she wasnt allowed to have anything to say. You tell me, Trump said. Trump on Sunday tweeted that Khans son had died 12 years ago: Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our leaders to eradicate it!  Trump also tweeted that he had been viciously attacked by Khan at the convention. Am I not allowed to respond? he asked. The candidate also tried to change the subject to the war itself: Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me! On Twitter, Republican strategist Ana Navarro called Trumps comments about the Khans gross and labeled him a jerk. Trumps campaign manager, Paul Manafort, said he sympathizes with the Khan family but that their loss is not the issue at hand. The issue really is radical Islamic jihad and the risk to the American homeland, he said on CBS, defending Trumps proposal to suspend immigration from some geographic regions.

Powerful Koch brothers rebuff big donors' calls to back Trump for White House,"COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (Reuters) - The billionaire industrialist Koch brothers rejected pressure over the weekend from dozens of big donors in their sprawling political network to back U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, saying that their money was better spent trying to influence congressional races. The rejection deprives Trump, a New York businessman who has never previously run for elected office, of a major source of fundraising and reflects how his unorthodox White House bid has sparked some disarray among fundraisers who would normally be squarely behind a Republican nominee. The Kochs, with a nearly $300 million political warchest,  have earned a reputation as powerful allies in Republican politics.  Charles Koch, the dominant player in his political partnership with brother David Koch, told attendees at a bi-annual donor retreat at a luxury resort in Colorado Springs, Colorado: At this point, I cant support either candidate for the White House.  He said networks mandate was to shore up the countrys financial future and eliminate corporate welfare, a reference to government subsidies provided to some industries. But since it appears that neither presidential candidate is likely to support us in these efforts, we are focused on maximizing the number of principled leaders in the House and Senate who will, he said.  Trumps protectionist stances and pledges to review free trade agreements and to get tough on immigration have clashed with the Kochs free-market political philosophy. Charles Koch has described as a a blood libel the idea he would instead support Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election. A group of wealthy Republican donors, who paid the minimum $100,000 per year to be members of the 700-strong Koch network, had been urging the brothers to step off the sidelines of the election and back Trump. The donors argued that if Trump is elected, the Koch network would want to have influence on his emerging policies and cabinet picks, and to have access to a Trump administration. Over cocktails on the patio overlooking the Rocky Mountains, in private meetings and on text message threads, some donors voiced their concern that if the Kochs alienate Trump, it could hurt us down the road.  Some suggested that some donors could leave the Koch network over the decision not to back Trump. Oil magnate Harold Hamm, a leading candidate to serve as Trumps energy secretary, did not attend the weekend gathering. Other donors who had been at the forefront of a movement to urge the Kochs to get on board with Trump, like billionaire broadcasting magnate Stanley Hubbard, said that in a private meeting with Charles, they had now been convinced that the Kochs were doing the right thing.   Trump has shown no hesitation in spurning the Kochs. On Friday, he tweeted that he had turned down an invitation to meet with the brothers. Koch insiders quickly disputed that characterization, saying an invite was never extended.   Nonetheless, the Koch brothers also did not act to stop Trump from beating 16 presidential rivals and winning the party nomination. During the primary contests, many Koch donors were urging the brothers to perform a Trump Intervention, whereby the brothers would leverage their political operation to support Trumps rivals. The Kochs refused. Trump officially accepted the Republican nomination in Cleveland last month, with a speech that painted a bleak picture of rising crime at home and increasing threats from overseas. The top Koch official on criminal justice reform, Mark Holden, said the speech was inaccurate. We are safer (now), he said. ",politicsNews,"August 1, 2016 ",1
Factbox: Gold Stars mark sacrifices of U.S. military families,"(Reuters) - A war of words between Donald Trump and the parents of a Muslim U.S. soldier killed in Iraq in 2004 is dominating the election campaign.  Khizr and Ghazala Khan were criticized by the Republican presidential candidate after they appeared at the Democratic National Convention last Thursday and shared the story of their son, U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan. The Khans are what is known in the United States as a Gold Star Family, meaning they have lost an immediate relative in a military action. The gold star refers to the centerpiece of flags given to these families. On Monday, more than 20 Gold Star Families wrote to Trump condemning his treatment of the couple, saying he was cheapening the sacrifice of soldiers who have died and demanding that he apologize to the Khans.   The following are some facts about Gold Star Families: * What are Gold Star Families?  Gold Star Families have lost a member of their immediate family in a war or other conflict while serving with the U.S. military. The military awards each family an official flag bearing a gold star or a lapel pin with a gold star on a purple background.  Called a service flag, families with relatives on active duty display a flag with a blue star.   * History of Gold Star Families Grace Seibold, whose son was killed in Europe in 1918 during World War One, founded a group that came to be known as American Gold Star Mothers for women who lost sons in the war. In the same year, President Woodrow Wilson approved a suggestion to let U.S. women wear a gold gilt star on a traditional black mourning arm band signifying their loss. In 1936, the United States began observing Gold Star Mothers Day on the last Sunday of September. An organization called The Gold Star Wives was formed before the end of World War Two, and the Gold Star Lapel Button was created in 1947. The term Gold Star Families was widely used after World War Two. * Different Service Flags A blue star signifies a relative serving in the military while a gold star means a family member has died in service. During World War One, relatives of active duty service members flew service flags bearing a blue star. As the gold star tradition took hold, families covered the blue star with a gold one to symbolize their loss. These flags were often hung in windows.  * How many Gold Star Families are there? The National Gold Star Family Registry notes on its website that 472,045 fallen service members have been registered by relatives. here * Which families wrote to Trump?  Mondays letter to Trump was signed by relatives of U.S. service members killed in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam and Korea.  ",politicsNews,"August 1, 2016 ",1
"The Big Squeeze: This election year, it’s all about the money","MIDDLETOWN, CONN. - Two years ago, Judy Konopka and Craig Diangelo lost their jobs in the IT department of what was then known as Northeast Utilities, a regional electricity provider, when the company decided to replace about 220 employees with guest workers from India. In order to receive a more lucrative separation package, they had to train their foreign replacements both here and overseas.  Both had trouble finding new work. Konopka, 56, is still looking. Diangelo, 64, is working as a contractor for a company that provides no benefits, making substantially less than he did before. He views himself as a victim of globalization, a casualty of offshoringand he credits Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee who has cast himself as the champion of displaced and disaffected U.S. workers, for bringing the issue to light.  Ill vote for him, says Diangelo, over dinner at a Thai restaurant on this towns Main Street. Two others at the table murmur in assent.  He continues, his voice rising: I wasnt planning on retiring early. I wasnt planning on making $35,000 less. Ive had to cut back a lot. I basically live paycheck to paycheck.  I could never vote for Hillary Clinton, Diangelo says, citing Clintons support of the North American Free Trade Agreement, passed while her husband, Bill, was president, as well as her advocacy of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact thats still being negotiated by the Obama administration. (Challenged by Bernie Sanders, Clinton has since retracted her support of TPP.) Even Konopka, who favors Clinton (she calls Trump the biggest idiot), has to admit Clintons support of trade deals such as NAFTA gives her pause. When Northeast Utilities fired her after 21 years, I felt betrayed. Konopka took advantage of a federal trade assistance program to improve her skills in web design, then discovered she couldnt compete with designers outside the country who were willing to work for much less. Now, to get by, she sells vintage books on the web. Its starting to get really scary, she says.  This presidential election is, purportedly, the Year of the Angry Voter, with images of scuffles at Trump rallies occupying cable-news screens. But as befitting someone who lives in a place called Middletown, Konopka is more typical of voters: consumed by a stomach-churning uncertainty, a vague sense of something lost, and an inescapable belief that an array of powerful forcescorporations, politicians, governmentarent looking out for them.  Economists and pundits have been struggling to explain why, with unemployment below 5 percent and a bounty of positive economic indicators, voters seem so dismayed, so distrustful. It might be something as simple as bargaining power.  In his best-known book, The Art of the Deal, Trump advises every negotiator to use your leverage. But increasingly, U.S. workers, white-and blue-collar alike, feel they have none. Theyve seen their power erode as they are tossed into a global labor pool, as companies consolidate and shed jobs to please Wall Street, as unions wither, state budgets tighten, technology advances and iconic brands such as Nabisco pack up and move to Mexico.  The squeeze is on.  Theres a feeling among workers that not only are they replaceable, but that they will be replaced, says Gary Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in nearby Worcester, Massachusetts. That there is no security anymore, that someone is making a profit by letting them go.  Trump, he adds, has tapped into that very well.  According to Reuters/Ipsos polling, 71 percent of Trump supporters either have had to take a lower-paying job in the last few years, have a family member who has had to do so, or have a family member whose home has been threatened by foreclosure. In a sign of how widespread the phenomenon has become, 63 percent of Clinton supporters reported the same dismal tally.  People feel more insecure about trade than terrorism, Chaison tells me. Everyone knows someone who has lost their job.  What bothers Diangelo most is that he was let go by a company that still valued his skilljust not him. The sad part is that my job is still there, he says. It didnt go away. I went away.  None of this should feel particularly new. The United States has been bleeding middle-class workersespecially in the industrial and manufacturing sectorsas long as Bruce Springsteen has been around to sing about it. Candidates adorned with hard hats vowing to bring back factory jobs have become a set-piece of modern politics.  The United States has lost more than 5 million manufacturing jobs in the past 15 years as the trade deficit has mushroomed, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank in Washington. Wage growth in almost all sectors has flatlined over that time, including for the bottom 70 percent of fouryear college graduatesand growth overall has been anemic, at under 2 percent. And while the 9 million jobs vaporized in the flash of the Great Recession have been recovered, the majority of them are of lesser quality than the ones they replaced.  Perhaps most fundamentally, the relationship between employee and employer has shifted. Workers share of the pie has decreased substantially since the 1970s, when the countrys corporate and industrial base began to erode. Last year, workers share dropped to 75.5 percent of corporate income, even as technology has made workforces more productive and efficient. U.S. corporate profits, meantime, returned to pre-recession levels in 2012. Workers sense that the recovery is only partial. It helps employers more than it helps workers, Chaison says.  If workers sense of slippage seems familiar, the way their discontent is rippling through our politics feels newly transformative. Voters threw out the Republicans running Congress in 2006, then two years later elected the first African-American president, an outsider who vowed reform. Souring on him, they replaced Democrats then controlling Congress with another set of Republicans in 2010 and 2014, making governance as unstable as the business sector. In a period of war, terrorism and economic chaos, all that churn might best be viewed as a deeply frustrated electorate trying to use what little leverage they have to change a system they consider to be otherwise unaccountable.  Trump has been the main beneficiary of that frustration. He makes those in the crowd feel like they matter, that they finally have a bully of their own who can push back at what they view as an alliance of unprincipled corporate culture and an enabling government. Youre looking at a situation where the jobs are being ripped out of our states, out of our country, like candy from a baby, Trump said at a rally this spring.  It has been Trump, along with Democrat Sanders, who has pushed the issue of job losses to countries such as China, Mexico and India to the forefront. Trump has threatened to slap a tax on imports and tear up trade deals. In Indiana earlier this year, he ripped air conditioner manufacturer Carrier for announcing it would lay off 2,100 workers and move its operations to Mexico. He gave Nabisco the same treatment, pledging he would no longer eat Oreos. He has slammed companies such as Apple and Boeing for their overseas operations, as well.  Few presidential candidates have such temerity to challenge well-known American brands, but clearly it is resonating. They might not like everything he says, but they believe he says what he thinks, Lewis Gossett, president of the South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance, told me last summer. I think were repeating a time in history when the very rich are removed from the very poor.  Michael Smith is one of the Americans Trump rallies for. Smith was among 600 Nabisco employees laid off at the bakery on Chicagos South Side earlier this year, after the company announced it was transferring some work to Mexico. He got the news at 3 a.m. It was, Smith tells me, a dark night when all your livelihood passes in front of you, and you feel like youve been given the royal shaft.  Smith operated the machines that wrapped Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers. With overtime, he could clear $85,000 a year. Hes 59 and wasnt thinking he would have to re-enter the job market.  The day before, Smith had shown up at a shareholders meeting in Chicago to confront Irene Rosenfeld, the chief executive of Mondelez International, the holding company that oversees the Nabisco brand, about the move to Mexico. While sympathetic, Rosenfeld said it was her duty to maximize the corporations value to its shareholders worldwide by cutting costs.  There are two types of CEO mindsets, Smith responded, those who care about shareholders and those who care about the shareholders and the people.  In our conversation, Smith didnt begrudge the companys legal right to relocate the jobs, but he questions a CEO who earned more than $40 million in compensation over the last two years exhorting the virtues of cost-cutting to a room full of laid-off blue-collar workers. Thats not good citizenship, he says. Wealth comes from the workers. That profitability comes from us.  Clinton met with a small group of the Nabisco workers in March, the day before the Illinois primary. But the visit didnt leave Smith with much hope that as president she could do much either for the workers situation or to reverse the demands of a globalized economy. In part, thats due to Clintons support of NAFTA, which Smith terms an infection, but also because of the lobbying might of Mondelez, a $30 billion company, and other big corporations.  Smith is the unusual American voter who says he hasnt decided between Clinton and Trump. Hell focus on the election later. First, he has to keep his household afloat and his daughter in school at Columbia College in Chicago. He has six months salary to cushion him.  Hes trying to stay optimistic about finding work, saying his wife and daughter are counting on him. But, he concedes, I think I have been a little bit in denial. Even people of faith have bouts of depression.  Angela Valero gives a one-word reply when I ask her about a potential Clinton-Trump matchup: Ugh. I might as well be asking about whos going to win the next regatta on Mars, so far is the election from her daily concerns.  Valeros dream job was to be a corrections officer. She was finally hired on by the state of Connecticut last fall. The single mother of an 8-year-old girl thought that, at last, she had a reliable, stable position with benefits.  But after completing an academy training course and being posted as a guard at the state maximum-security facility in nearby Uncasville, she found out this spring that she was being laid off, a consequence of a decision made by Connecticuts Democratic governor, Dannel Malloy, and the state legislature to not raise taxes on the wealthy to cover a budget shortfall. Lawmakers worried that the states richest residents would relocate to Florida, which has no state income tax, or other states with lower taxes.  During the downturn, Connecticut lost a bevy of high-paying jobs in the financial services sector in the corporate hub of Stamford and elsewhere. The jobs created during the recovery were less lucrative, resulting in lower tax revenue. In addition, the state was spooked when General Electric, responding to an effort by the legislature to raise business taxes, announced it was relocating its headquarters from Fairfield to Boston. Aetna, the health insurer based in Hartford, also threatened to leave the state.  That shelved any notion of new taxes. The state looked to trim its public workforce instead. Easy targets, says Lori Pelletier, president of the state AFL-CIO.  Rape counselors, child-service workers, prison guards began receiving pink slips. Ultimately, 2,500 or more state workers could be let go. Pelletier contrasted that with the 200 jobs GE is moving to Bostonsomething that drew substantial media attention.  The state of Massachusetts and the city of Boston helped recruit GE with a generous benefit package, including $25 million in property tax relief for a corporation that critics have long held pays little in U.S. taxes. Angela last year paid more taxes than GE, Pelletier says. And shes the one losing her job.  Valero tells me she has little faith that anyone in Washington can help her. She doesnt sleep more than four hours a night, kept up by worrying about paying the electric bill and keeping her house. She has no idea whether shell ever be recalled to work.  Throughout the interview, she stays stoic, determined, like the corrections office she was trained to be. Only at the end of our conversation does she slip a bit. I held back the tears, she says with relief.  Ron Ozer greets me at the door with the sheepishness of someone who isnt used to being at home during the workday. Ozer, 53, was laid off from DuPont Co. in January after a 23-year career. A Ph.D in chemical engineering, he has more than 20 patents to his name. He worked on long-term projects at the DuPont Experimental Station in Wilmington, Delaware, one of the more storied research facilities in the country, where products such as nylon, Lycra and Kevlar were created.  Some of the great developments in American industry came out of that site, Ozer says. It was a time when America was growing so dramatically.  But a lack of growth and pressure from investors forced DuPont to announce a merger with another giant, Dow Chemical. In advance of the merger, it has begun to shed jobs. In Delaware alone, DuPont plans to dump 1,700 workersmany in the area of long-term research, which can be expensive without yielding immediate rewards to shareholders. Ozers group was eviscerated.  The $130 billion merger of DuPont and Dow blends two U.S. companies that date back to the 19th century. Barry Lynn, an economist at the New America think tank, says that industry consolidation chills the labor market, sapping demand for skilled workers such as Ozer. Dominant companies can use their market power to charge customers more or make suppliers pay lessall without having to grow and create jobs to survive. Indeed, the push from Wall Street is to cull and cut, not grow. And when companies do expand today its largely through acquisition, not investment.  Thats a huge amount of the energy thats behind Trump, Lynn says, the sense of power being consolidated and being out of control and harming me and my family and my community.  Ozer will try to take advantage of his contacts at DuPont to become a consultant, but admits thats a gamble. Asked if he thinks he can replicate the six-figure salary he enjoyed at DuPont, he laughs. Im not confident of that.  His chief concern is his two daughters, both of whom are out of college. In order to give his youngest a leg up in the market, he sent her to private Haverford College in Pennsylvania (tuition: $46,000)going deep into debt to do so. I have a lot of possibilities, but I need things to start turning into dollars soon, he says.  For Sara Blackwell, representing U.S. workers displaced by the federal H1-B visa program began as a gig. Now, its a full-blown cause.  The Tampa lawyer has been giving away clients who would distract her from her work. She jokes shes stopped sleeping and exercising. Recently, she launched a website called ProtectUSworkers.com. I speak to an average of 10 people a day who are victims of this, she tells me. The more I learn about this, the more I have to fight.  She began by representing IT workers at Walt Disney World in Florida who were replaced by guest workers from India brought in on temporary visas by outsourcing firms that contracted with Disney. She has filed a long-shot conspiracy lawsuit in federal court.  Blackwell contends that the practice of outsourcing low-end, back-office IT jobs to cut costs has become endemic. Globalization, she says, is systematically lowering the standard of living of American workers. Its a race to the bottom, she says.  The Disney case garnered the attention of some in the U.S. Senate, including Jeff Sessions, a Republican from Alabama who now is at the forefront of a fight against the American tech industry, which wants to expand the guest-worker program citing a lack of domestic qualified engineers and programmers.  But those tech companies are at the back of the line. According to Ron Hira, a professor at Howard University who tracks applications, outsourcing firms have been crowding out tech companies in the race to acquire the highly coveted H1-B visas, which are capped at 85,000 a year.  Sessions, who is also a fierce opponent of immigration reform, was one of the first U.S. politicians to embrace Trumpand Blackwell has spoken out against the program at several Trump rallies.  She also has consulted with the outsourced employees who worked at Northeast Utilities in Connecticut, including Craig Diangelo.  Part of Diangelos frustrationand part of what is driving him toward Trumpis that Washington has done so little to curb what he views as abuses of the H1-B program. There is a greater push now on Capitol Hill to broaden the program rather than rein it in. Theres nobody to help us, he tells me. Theres nobody to say you cant do this.  Richard Blumenthal, a U.S. senator from Connecticut, has been part of efforts to expand the program, but also to reform it. Its a desperately serious problem, he says.  He told me that even though there is some bipartisan consensus on reform, efforts still arent moving forward, consumed by the same paralysis thats stalling everything else.  There are powerful forces against us, Blumenthal says, including the companies that exploit these programs.  To Diangelo, thats the dilemma of the modern, middle-class voter. He worked hard for years, lost his job when his only transgression was being too old and making too much money, was humiliated when he had to train his replacement, and then watched how state and federal politicians have been able to do nothing to help him.  Why shouldnt he support Donald Trump? Whats worth preserving? Hes a tech worker, sipping Pinot Grigio over pad thai. Hes no militant or conspiracist. Yet...  There is going to be an uprising, he says. People are starting to say: `Ive had enough of this. Ive really had enough.

White House candidate Clinton sees big boost in fundraising in July,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton raised nearly $90 million in July for her campaign and the Democratic Party, with more than half the donations coming from new donors, the campaign said on Tuesday. Clintons campaign said it had $58 million in the bank as it starts August, and that the donations it received last month averaged $44. Of the $90 million raised, $63 million was for Clintons presidential campaign while about $26 million was for other Democrats, it said in a statement. In June, Clinton, the Democratic nominee raised $68.5 million. The campaign credited last weeks Democratic National Convention with the boost in fundraising in July. It said its best 24-hour period for online fundraising began Thursday night when Clinton accepted the partys nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election. The campaign said it raised $8.7 million during that period. In a fundraising email to supporters, the Clinton campaign stressed it could not take a single vote for granted as it seeks to make history in November with the election of the first woman to be U.S. president. If we underestimate our opponent or take this race for granted, well lose, the email said, referring to Republican nominee Donald Trump. ",politicsNews,"August 2, 2016 ",1
"Briton in Trump gun incident could die in U.S. prison, mother says","LONDON (Reuters) - A British man detained in the United States for allegedly trying to wrestle a gun from a police officer at a Donald Trump rally is suffering from severe mental illness and risks dying in prison, his mother said on Tuesday. Michael Sandford, 20, is due to face trial in Nevada on Aug. 22. He has pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and one felony count of impeding and disrupting the orderly conduct of government business. His mother, Lynne Sandford, told a news conference in London that her son, who has been diagnosed in the past with autism, depression and other mental health conditions, had been on suicide watch in a Nevada prison for the past three weeks. She portrayed her son as a compassionate, child-like man who enjoyed watching Peppa Pig, a British childrens television program, and who was bewildered and frightened by his incarceration. She said her son had attempted to take his own life when he was 14 years old and was suffering from anorexia. Michael Sandford was arrested after an incident at a Trump rally at the Treasure Island hotel in Las Vegas on June 18, and later told an investigator he wanted to kill the Republican presidential candidate, according to U.S. court papers. He has not been charged with attempted murder. I accept that Michael has tried to do a bad thing but he is mentally ill and is not a bad or dangerous person, said his mother, adding that she had last spoken to him on the phone on Sunday. He kept breaking down and sobbing on the phone, saying please, please, I just want to come home. Hes very remorseful ... Hes just in a really bad way, she said. Sandford has launched a campaign to have her son repatriated to Britain so he could be treated in a secure medical facility. She has raised $25,950 through the crowd-funding website Crowd Justice to pay for legal and other expenses. She said a British consular official who had visited her son in prison had reported that he was shackled and handcuffed. Its not clear that Michael actually understands what he has done, said Saimo Chahal, the familys British lawyer, speaking alongside Lynne Sandford. Because of his Aspergers, OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) and other psychological conditions there is a question mark over whether hes fit to plead and to undergo the trial process in the States, she said. Chahal said she was working to provide the public defenders office in Nevada with independent evidence of Michael Sandfords mental illness. She expected the trial to be postponed by at least 56 days initially to allow time for that. She hoped a trial would not happen and that Sandford would be repatriated to Britain as part of a plea bargain agreement. ",politicsNews,"August 2, 2016 ",1
"Buffett rebukes Trump, questions his business skill","OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Monday campaigned alongside U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at a rowdy rally in his home state of Nebraska, where he challenged Republican Donald Trump to release his tax returns and questioned Trumps business acumen. Trump, a New York real estate developer making his first run at public office, has said he cannot release his tax returns, a ritual of U.S. presidential campaigns, until the Internal Revenue Service has completed an audit. Now Ive got news for him, said Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) conglomerate is based in Omaha. Im under audit, too, and I would be delighted to meet him anyplace, anytime, before the election. Ill bring my tax return, he can bring his tax return ... and let people ask us questions about the items that are on there, Buffett added, saying Trump was afraid not of the tax-collecting IRS but of voters. In response, Trumps spokeswoman Hope Hicks said: As you know, Mr. Trump is undergoing a routine audit. She had no immediate comment when asked to respond to Buffett saying that he too was under audit but would release his tax returns. Trump has asserted his success as a businessman qualifies him to lead the country, but Buffett, who backs Clinton in the Nov. 8 election, said Trump lost money the only time he went to the American people and asked them to invest.  He said it was in 1995 when Trump listed his Trump hotels and casino resorts on the New York Stock Exchange. He said the company lost money every year for the next decade. A monkey would have outperformed Trumps company, Buffett said. In 1995, if a monkey had thrown a dart at the stock page, the monkey on average would have made 150 percent, he said. Buffett spoke for nearly 30 minutes to a raucous capacity crowd of roughly 3,100 people in a suburban Omaha high school with Clinton sitting at his side. He said Trumps final straw was an ABC interview broadcast on Sunday in which he criticized the Muslim parents of a decorated U.S. soldier killed by a bomb in Iraq 12 years ago. The father Khizr Khan spoke at last weeks Democratic National Convention about their son and attacked Trump for proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Trump said he was viciously attacked by Khan, a naturalized U.S. citizen, when the father publicly doubted Trump had read the U.S. Constitution. Khan said that Trump had sacrificed nothing, prompting Trump in his ABC interview to say, I think Ive made a lot of sacrifices. Buffett on Monday bluntly contradicted Trump. No member of the Buffett family has gone to Iraq or Afghanistan. No member of the Trump family has gone to Iraq or Afghanistan, Buffett said. Weve both done extremely well during this period and our families havent sacrificed anything. In his remarks Buffett announced the launch of a get-out-the vote effort, pledging to take at least 10 people to the polls who would otherwise have difficulty getting there. Buffett said he was backing a website, Drive2Vote, that would coordinate transportation to cast votes and that he had reserved a trolley that seats 32 people for the same purpose. Im going to be on it all day. Im going to do selfies, whatever it takes, Buffett said. Buffett said his goal is to generate the highest voter turnout in the congressional district that includes Omaha of any in the country. Nebraska is one of two U.S. states that award electoral votes in presidential elections by congressional district. Clinton responded to Buffetts pledge with a promise of her own, if his turnout goal is met. Warren and I will dance in the streets of Omaha together! Maybe if were really lucky hell wear his Elvis costume again! she said.  ",politicsNews,"August 1, 2016 ",1
Colorado Governor says Trump doesn't understand fracking issue: Denver Post,"(Reuters) - Governor of Colorado John Hickenlooper on Monday criticized Donald Trumps comments about fracking, saying the Republican presidential candidate does not completely understand the issue,  the Denver Post reported. Trump, during a campaign in Colorado, said that while he supports fracking, he also believes state and local governments should be able to ban fracking, the Denver Post reported. (dpo.st/2aIHGZy) Hickenlooper, a former geologist, called the issue a tricky thing when asked why he thought Trump was wrong to support locals ability to ban fracking, the publication wrote.  He also added that if total responsibility is given to local authorities, any oil and gas activity would be voted to be banned, and people who own these private properties with the minerals would lose out, the publication reported.  The Colorado Supreme Court has a ruling in force which does not allow local governments to ban fracking. A representative for Trump was not immediately available for comment.

Donald Trump fires senior adviser Ed Brookover: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Monday fired senior adviser Ed Brookover, two sources close to his campaign said. The sources did not say why Brookover was fired. A statement from the Trump campaign confirmed Brookover had left. The campaign has parted ways with Ed, but we are thankful to him for his many contributions and appreciate his continued support, the Trump campaign said in a statement. Brookover did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Brookover, who joined the Trump campaign in March, was appointed in June to serve as a liaison between the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. Prior to joining Trump, Brookover served as campaign manager to Ben Carson during his failed bid for the Republican nomination. ",politicsNews,"August 2, 2016 ",1
Trump rebuts criticism by Army father at Democratic convention,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump rejected criticism from the father of a soldier killed in Iraq who said the Republican presidential nominee had sacrificed nothing and no one and questioned whether the mother was allowed to speak during the couples appearance at the Democratic convention.  I think Ive made a lot of sacrifices, Trump told ABC News in excerpts of an interview posted on Saturday. I work very, very hard.  Khizr Khan, a U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin and a Muslim, won widespread praise when he spoke Thursday at the Democratic National Convention, telling the story of his son, U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, who was killed by a bomb in Iraq in 2004.  He also attacked Trump for proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and asked if the candidate had read the U.S. Constitution. He pulled out a pocket-copy from the inside of his suit coat, in one of the most commented moments on the night that Hillary Clinton accepted her partys nomination for president.   Did Hillarys script writers write it? Trump asked ABCs George Stephanopoulos in the interview, saying he has indeed sacrificed by employing thousands of people, and raising millions of dollars for veterans.  Trump said Khan appeared very emotional and probably looked like a nice guy to me. But the businessman also cast doubt on why Khans wife did not speak. She was standing there, she had nothing to say, she probably, maybe she wasnt allowed to have anything to say, you tell me, Trump said. Clinton at a campaign rally Saturday night in Youngstown, Ohio, said the Khans specifically and Muslims generally are the most recent recipients of Trumps insults, and referenced his past statements about immigrants and the disabled. Its a long list my friends. I dont know, maybe he doesnt have anything positive to say, Clinton said.  Earlier in the day, Clinton said in a statement that she was very moved to see Ghazala Khan stand bravely and with dignity in support of her sonon Thursday night. And I was very moved to hear her speak last night, bravely and with dignity, about her sons life and the ultimate sacrifice he made for his country. Ghazala Khan told MSNBC on Friday that she chose not to speak because she still cannot bear to see her sons photographs. Khizr Khan told the New York Times that the Clinton campaign asked if he need speechwriting help or coaching. I said: I really dont, I have my thoughts in my head, Khan told the Times, adding, Just let me say what I want to say. It will be heart-to-heart.       ",politicsNews,"July 31, 2016 ",1
Russia says accusations it was behind DNC email hack are insulting - Ifx,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russias Foreign Ministry said on Monday that U.S. accusations that Moscow was behind a hack of Democratic National Committee computers were insulting and unworthy, the Interfax news agency reported.

Kremlin: U.S. covering up election intrigue by demonising Russia,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Monday that U.S. allegations Moscow was behind the hacking of Democratic Party emails were part of a cover-up designed to hide the fact that the U.S. election campaign had been manipulated by domestic forces. U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said on Sunday Russian intelligence services had hacked into Democratic National Committee computers, and she questioned Republican rival Donald Trumps overtures to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Such pronouncements by Mrs Clinton are of the pre-election rhetoric genre and do not contain anything tangible, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call. In this case they (the Americans) are trying to camouflage some of their own (pre-election) shenanigans by demonising Russia. We consider that to be wrong. Peskov said Clintons comments were absurd and emotional and lacking in facts, saying it was wrong to accuse Moscow of wrongdoing without first investigating the accusations. Official Russian bodies ... do not carry out cyber terrorism, he said, saying the Kremlin wanted to see U.S.-Russia relations normalised.  The Kremlin has repeatedly denied involvement in the hacking incident and said it does not favour any candidate in the Nov. 8 U.S. election. Despite its official stance, Kremlin-backed TV has tilted its coverage in favour of Trump whom Putin has called very talented. ",politicsNews,"August 1, 2016 ",1
Clinton says Russian intelligence services hacked DNC,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said Russian intelligence services hacked into Democratic National Committee computers and she accused Republican contender Donald Trump of showing support for Russian President Vladimir Putin. We know that Russian intelligence services hacked into the DNC and we know that they arranged for a lot of those emails to be released and we know that Donald Trump has shown a very troubling willingness to back up Putin, to support Putin, Clinton said in an interview with Fox News Sunday. The United States has not publicly accused Russia of being behind the hack of Democratic Party computers. Cyber security experts and U.S. officials, however, said they believed Russia engineered the release of the emails to influence the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Asked if she believed Putin wanted Trump to win the White House, Clinton said she was not going to jump to that conclusion. But I think laying out the facts raises serious issues about Russian interference in our elections, in our democracy, Clinton told Fox in the interview, taped Saturday. The United States would not tolerate that from any other country, especially one considered an adversary, she said. For Trump to both encourage that and to praise Putin  despite what appears to be a deliberate effort to try to affect the election I think raises national security issues, she said. The New York businessman has praised Putin, saying he was a stronger leader than U.S. President Barack Obama, a Democrat. Trump last week invited Russia to dig up tens of thousands of missing emails from Clintons time at the U.S. State Department. Russia, if youre listening, I hope youre able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, Trump told reporters. The Republican presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election later said he was being sarcastic in his comments, which raised concerns among intelligence experts and criticism that  Trump was urging a foreign government to spy on Americans.

"Clinton says Russia behind DNC hacking, draws line to Trump","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said on Sunday that Russian intelligence services hacked into Democratic National Committee computers and she questioned Republican rival Donald Trumps overtures to Russian President Vladimir Putin. We know that Russian intelligence services hacked into the DNC and we know that they arranged for a lot of those emails to be released and we know that Donald Trump has shown a very troubling willingness to back up Putin, to support Putin, Clinton said in an interview with Fox News Sunday. The White House has declined to speculate on who was behind the hack of Democratic Party computers, referring to an ongoing investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Cybersecurity experts and U.S. officials, however, said they believed Russia engineered the release of the emails to influence the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.  Reuters reported a computer network used by Clintons campaign was hacked as part of the broad cyber attack on Democratic political organizations. The United States would not tolerate that from any other country, especially one considered an adversary, Clinton said. For Trump to both encourage that and to praise Putin  despite what appears to be a deliberate effort to try to affect the election I think raises national security issues, she said. Asked if she believed Putin wanted Trump in the White House, Clinton said she was not going to jump to that conclusion. But I think laying out the facts raises serious issues about Russian interference in our elections, in our democracy, Clinton told Fox in the interview, taped on Saturday.

He later said he was being sarcastic in his comments, which raised concerns among intelligence experts and criticism that Trump was urging a foreign government to spy on Americans. Senator Jeff Sessions, a supporter of Trump, criticized  Clinton for leaving her email system vulnerable to Russian penetration and defended Trumps comments. I have people come up to me all the time and say Why dont you, if you want to find out where those 30,000 emails are, why dont youask the Russians? Sessions told CNN.  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange refused to answer questions on Sunday about whether a foreign government leaked the DNC emails to the group. Its an interesting speculative question for the press, he told NBCs Meet the Press. Trumps absolute allegiance to a lot of Russian wish-list foreign policy positions is among the reasons he is unfit to be commander in chief, Clinton, a former U.S. senator, secretary of state and first lady, said in the Fox interview. Trump alarmed allies this month when he indicated he might abandon NATOs mutual defense guarantee in the face of potential Russian aggression if members had not paid their bills. He also  suggested he would consider easing sanctions on Russia and recognizing its annexation of Ukraines Crimea region. On Sunday, Trump referred to that annexation again in a way that appeared to justify it. The people of Crimea, from what Ive heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were, he said on ABCs This Week. He also said Putin was not going to go into Ukraine, prompting a rebuke from Clinton adviser Jake Sullivan. Russia is already in Ukraine. Does he not know that? Sullivan said in a statement. Trump often speaks wistfully about smoother relations between Washington and Moscow. Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing, he said on ABC. Such comments often leave his campaign to try to toughen the rhetoric. I think Mr. Trump has made it very clear he views Russia to be somebody that we need to be firm with, campaign manager Paul Manafort said on CBS Face the Nation. ",politicsNews,"July 31, 2016 ",1

"Trump 'not thrilled' with debate dates, Clinton vows 'to be there'","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican candidate Donald Trump said he is unhappy with the dates set for this falls presidential debates, but White House rival Hillary Clinton countered that the schedule was decided long ago and vowed to show up regardless of his objections.      The nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has scheduled three televised debates ahead of the Nov. 8 election - Monday, Sept. 26, Sunday, Oct. 9, and Wednesday, Oct. 19. The dates were set almost a year ago. Trump and other Republicans said they should be changed because of conflicts with National Football League games. I think two of the three are against the NFL, so Im not thrilled with that, the Republican presidential nominee said in an interview with ABCs This Week that aired on Sunday. Speaking to reporters while campaigning at a cheese barn in Ashland, Ohio, Clinton noted that the debate schedule had been established long before the two major political parties chose their nominees. Im going to be there. Thats all Ill say, Clinton said just days after the end of the Democratic National Convention, where the former secretary of state accepted her partys presidential nomination. In a statement, the commission said the chosen dates will serve the American public well, adding that it was impossible to avoid all sporting events when working out the schedule. It said the debates had never been rescheduled for such conflicts. Trump, who tweeted on Friday that Clinton was trying to rig the debates so that fewer people would watch, suggested in the ABC interview that his rival wanted the debates to be held when nobodys home to watch. Newt Gingrich, a Trump adviser and former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives,tweeted that the scheduling makes me think the commission is rigged to help hide Hillary from the voters. The commission was established in 1987 by the Republicans and Democrats to ensure the debates became a permanent part of the campaign after a series of hastily arranged events in 1976, 1980 and 1984 - and no debates in 1964, 1968 and 1972. Neither party is involved with running the commission, which is governed by an independent board of directors. It is co-chaired by former Republican National Committee chairman Frank Fahrenkopf and Mike McCurry, a former press secretary in Bill Clintons White House. David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, suggested on Twitter that Trump could be just trying to ditch the debates. When asked directly whether Trump would participate, his campaign manager, Paul Manafort, said the Republican candidate wants to participate but also seeks the maximum audience. So were going to sit down with the commission in the next week or so and were going to start talking to them and we want to make sure we have a broad audience, understanding, watching the debates, Manafort told CBSs Face the Nation. RNC Chairman Reince Preibus said the debates would get more viewers if they were on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday nights. Were going to be working with the commission and what theyre putting together, Preibus said on CBS. Were not going to agree with anything that our nominee doesnt agree with. Clinton adviser John Podesta called the complaints more Trump debate malarkey. We will be at the debates set by the bipartisan debate commission and expect he will too, Podesta said on Twitter. Trump also told ABC he had received a letter from the NFL saying the debate dates were ridiculous. But Brian McCarthy, a spokesman for the NFL, said there was no such letter. While wed obviously wish the debate commission could find another night, we did not send a letter to Mr. Trump, McCarthy said on Twitter. ",politicsNews,"July 31, 2016 ",1

Islamic State calls slain Muslim American soldier an 'apostate',"DUBAI (Reuters) - Islamic State on Sunday condemned as an apostate a U.S. Muslim soldier killed in Iraq whose story has re-ignited debate in the 2016 presidential election on the role of Muslims in American life. Dabiq, the militant groups online magazine, showed a picture of U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khans tombstone in Arlington National Cemetery with a caption, Beware of Dying as an apostate. An accompanying article, penned by an unnamed American convert in the Islamic State, urged Muslims to resist Western influences and to either migrate to Islamic State-controlled lands or carry out lone attacks. Reject these calls to disunity and come together. Live the life of Islam, for which you have already left the path of falsehood, the militant wrote. You are behind enemy lines, able to strike them where it hurts them most, the article added. Khans death in a bomb attack in Iraq in 2004 re-emerged as an election issue when his father gave a speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday in which he paid homage to his son. Khizr Khan, a U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin and a Muslim,  also criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and asked if the candidate had read the U.S. Constitution. Trump rejected the criticism and questioned whether the soldiers mother was allowed to speak during the couples appearance at the podium. Ghazala Khan later said the outspoken billionaire was ignorant of Islam and of sacrifice.  Trump has stoked outrage during his unorthodox campaign by supporting racial profiling for Muslim Americans in the wake of a deadly shooting by a U.S.-born Muslim man killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando in June. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has said the comments and other pointed remarks about American minorities show Trump is unfit to be president. ",politicsNews,"July 31, 2016 ",1
Clinton leads Trump by 6 points after Democratic confab: Reuters/Ipsos poll," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton held a 6- percentage-point lead over Republican rival Donald Trump, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll with new wording that was released on Friday, the day after she formally accepted her partys nomination for the Nov. 8 election.  Nearly 41 percent of likely voters favor Clinton, 35 percent favor Trump, and 25 percent picked Other, according to the new July 25-29 online poll of 1,043 likely voters, which overlapped with the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.  The poll has a credibility interval of 4 percentage points.

An internal review had found the word Neither has, at times, siphoned support away from one or the other candidate.  Former Secretary of State Clinton delivered an upbeat keynote address at the Democratic convention on Thursday night, as she became the first woman to accept the presidential nomination from a major party.  In the biggest speech of her more than 25-year-old career in the public eye, Clinton, 68, cast herself as a steady leader at a moment of reckoning for the country, and contrasted her character with what she described as Trumps dangerous and volatile temperament.  Trump, a 70-year-old New York businessman and former reality TV show host who has never held political office, responded in a Twitter post late on Thursday that Hillarys vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.  Both candidates were on the campaign trail on Friday, kicking off what is expected to be a hotly contested general election battle.  A separate Reuters/Ipsos survey that provided respondents with the option to choose from Clinton, Trump, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, has Clinton and Trump tied at 37 percentage points.

Clinton secures Mark Cuban's endorsement in Pittsburgh,"PITTSBURGH, Pa. - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton toured the U.S. Rust Belt on Saturday, promising to reject bad international trade deals during a factory visit and securing the endorsement of investor Mark Cuban at a Pittsburgh rally. The Dallas Mavericks owner, who said as recently as last month that there was a good chance he would vote for Donald Trump, instead criticized the Republican nominees leadership in front of an energetic crowd. Leadership is not yelling and screaming and intimidating, Cuban said. You know what we call a person like that in Pittsburgh? A jagoff! Cuban added, using disparaging Pittsburgh slang. Cuban had spoken with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta several times in recent weeks and called him on Thursday to say he was ready to endorse Clinton, a campaign aide said. Clinton, along with her running-mate Tim Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia, is on a three-day tour of Pennsylvania and Ohio after becoming the first woman to accept a major U.S. partys presidential nomination at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia on Thursday. Pennsylvania and Ohio are two states in the U.S. Rust Belt that are dealing with job losses caused by the decline in U.S. manufacturing. Neither leans heavily in favor of either political party but both voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012.  Trump has zeroed in on white, working-class voters in the region as critical to his campaign and plans to visit both states early next week.  In a visit earlier on Saturday to Johnstown Wire Technologies in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Clinton told the largely union crowd there that she would create good-paying jobs by investing in infrastructure and reject a pending Asia trade deal that has become a flashpoint in the U.S. presidential campaign. We are going to say no to unfair trade deals, were going to stand up to China, Clinton said.  I feel strongly about this and I need your help, she added. The pending Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiated by President Barack Obama has drawn criticism from both Clinton and Trump. Clinton says it does not do enough to protect U.S. workers. Trump has said he would rip it up and questioned whether Clinton would keep her stance if she wins the Nov. 8 presidential election. Leo Gerard, the president of the United Steelworkers, which represents roughly 200 of the 260 workers employed by Johnstown Wire Technologies, assured the crowd in his introduction of Clinton that Republicans have been telling lies about Clintons stance on the deal.  Cambria County, where Johnstown Wire Technologies is based, is 94-percent white and has a median household income of $42,000. Clinton and Kaine will continue their jobs-focused tour that began in Philadelphia, continuing on to Youngstown and Columbus. They are trying to contrast their plan to use infrastructure investments to create jobs with that of Trump, whom Clinton said Friday has a downbeat vision of America. We are visiting places that prove what Americans can do, Clinton said in Johnstown. This country and our people have what it takes to get ahead and stay ahead if they have the leadership that gives us that chance. ",politicsNews,"July 30, 2016 ",1
Exclusive: Clinton campaign also hacked in attacks on Democrats,"WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A computer network used by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintons campaign was hacked as part of a broad cyber attack on Democratic political organizations, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The latest attack, which was disclosed to Reuters on Friday, follows two other hacks on the Democratic National Committee, or DNC, and the partys fundraising committee for candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives. A Clinton campaign spokesman said in a statement late on Friday that an analytics data program maintained by the DNC and used by the campaign and a number of other entities was accessed as part of the DNC hack. Our campaign computer system has been under review by outside cyber security experts. To date, they have found no evidence that our internal systems have been compromised, said Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill. Later, a campaign official said hackers had access to the analytics programs server for approximately five days. The analytics data program is one of many systems the campaign accesses to conduct voter analysis, and does not include social security numbers or credit card numbers, the official said. The U.S. Department of Justice national security division is investigating whether cyber attacks on Democratic political organizations threatened U.S. security, sources familiar with the matter said onFriday. The involvement of the Justice Departments national security division is a sign that the Obama administration has concluded that thehacking was sponsored by a state, people with knowledge of the investigation said. While it is unclear exactly what material the hackers may have gained access to, the third such attack on sensitive Democratic targets disclosed in the last six weeks has caused alarm in the party and beyond, just over three months before the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Hackers, whom U.S. intelligence officials have concluded were Russian, gained access to the entire network of the fundraising Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC, said people familiar with the matter, detailing the extent of the breach to Reuters for the first time. Cyber security experts and U.S. officials said earlier this week they had concluded, based on analysis of malware and other aspects of the DNC hack, that Russia engineered the release of hacked Democratic Party emails to influence the U.S. presidential election. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Friday it was aware of media reporting on cyber intrusions involving multiple political entities, and is working to determine the accuracy, nature and scope of these matters. The FBI takes seriously any allegations of intrusions, and we will continue to hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace, the agency said in an emailed statement. The hack did not involve the private email system Clinton used while she was secretary of state. Yahoo News reported on Thursday night that the FBI had warned the Clinton campaign last March that it was a target of a cyber attack involving spearphishing and had asked the campaign to turn over sensitive data to help in its investigation, but that campaign lawyers rejected this request as too intrusive. A source familiar with the matter confirmed this account to Reuters.  The new disclosure to Reuters that hackers gained access to the full DCCC network means they would have had access to everything on the network from emails to strategy memos and opposition research prepared to support Democratic candidates in campaigns for the House. The hack of the DCCC, which is based in Washington, was reported first by Reuters onThursday, ahead of Clintons speech in Philadelphia accepting the Democratic partys nomination. Russian officials could not beimmediately reached for comment. Several U.S. officials said the Obama administration has avoided publicly attributing the attacks to Russia as that might undermine Secretary of State John Kerrys effort to win Russian cooperation in the war on Islamic State in Syria. The officials said the administration fears Russian President Vladimir Putin might respond to a public move by escalating cyber attacks on U.S. targets, increasing military harassment of U.S. and allied aircraft and warships in the Baltic and Black Seas, and making more aggressive moves in Eastern Europe. Some officials question the approach, arguing that responding more forcefully to Russia would be more effective than remaining silent. The Obama administration announced in an April 2015 executive order that it could apply economic sanctions in response to cyber attacks.  The hack on the DNC, made public in June, led to WikiLeaks publishing more than 19,000 emails last weekend, some of them showing favoritism within the DNC for Clinton over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned on Sunday as a result, creating a rocky start for the partys convention in Philadelphia this week. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday invited Russia to dig up thousands of missing emails from Clintons time at the State Department, prompting Democrats to accuse him of urging foreigners to spy on Americans. On Thursday, Trump said his remarks were meant as sarcasm. Earlier in the week, Clinton campaign senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan had criticized Trump and called the hacking a national security issue. Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said on Friday the reported breach showed cyber security is a problem wherever Hillary Clinton goes. Hopefully this time there wasnt classified or top secret information that puts American lives at risk. In Washington, the DCCC said early on Friday it had hired cyber security firm CrowdStrike to investigate. We have taken and are continuing to take steps to enhance the security of our network, the DCCC said. We are cooperating with federal law enforcement with respect to their ongoing investigation. The DCCC had no additional comment late on Friday. Officials at the DNC did not respond to requests for comment.  Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat and the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, told CNN on Friday she had not heard about the hack of the Clinton campaign. But she said: It wouldnt surprise me. I think it should be pretty clear that both campaigns should be aware that theres a problem out there. Everybody should be cautious.

Trump to Clinton: 'No more Mr. Nice Guy',"COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he was taking the gloves off in his battle against Democrat Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House after taking a scorching from speakers at the Democratic National Convention. Trump wrapped up a five-day, seven-state campaign swing in Colorado on Friday, where for a fifth straight day his supporters chanted lock her up whenever he brought up Clintons name. Trump supporters say Clinton deserves to be prosecuted for her handling of U.S. foreign policy as President Barack Obamas first-term secretary of state and for her use of a private email server while in that office. All week Trump has sought to tamp down the chants by stressing that his main goal is to simply beat Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election. But as the crowd chanted the slogan in Colorado Springs, Trump finally relented. Im starting to agree with you, frankly, he said. No more Mr. Nice Guy. In Denver later, he changed his tune when he heard the chant. Ill tell you what Id rather do, honestly, is just beat her on Nov. 8 at the polls. She would be a disaster, he said. Trump was a punching bag at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, which wrapped up Thursday night, as speaker after speaker - including some Republicans - said he lacked the temperament to be president. Clinton herself said in her acceptance speech that the election represented a moment of reckoning for the country. In Colorado Springs, Trump got sidetracked by a couple of disputes from last year as he tried to rebut a Clinton campaign ad. That ad uses video clip from Trumps attack on Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly in protest of her questioning of him at a debate of Republican presidential contenders last August when he said afterward that blood was coming out of her eyes, coming out of her wherever. I was talking about her nose, Trump said in Colorado Springs. I wanted to get back on the issue of taxes at the debate. Trump also brought up the case of disabled New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, whom Trump seemed to mock publicly in video used by the Clinton ad. Trump said he was depicting the reporter groveling to him. I didnt know he was disabled. I didnt know it at all. I had no idea, he said. ",politicsNews,"July 30, 2016 ",1
Clinton gets down to campaign business with Rust Belt trip,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took her newly energized White House bid on the road on Friday for a tour of crucial Rust Belt states Pennsylvania and Ohio, but the campaigns focus was clouded by a newly disclosed cyber attack. Reuters on Friday reported that the computer network used by Clintons campaign, which is based in Brooklyn, had been hacked as part of a broad cyber attack on Democratic political organizations, citing people familiar with the matter. The campaign said a data program maintained by the Democratic National Committee and used by the campaign and other entities was accessed as part of a cyber attack on the DNC. The Clinton campaign said outside experts had found no evidence that its internal systems had been compromised.  On Thursday, Reuters reported that the partys fundraising committee for candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives had also been breached, the second such incident after last weekends leak of DNC emails. Revelations from the DNC emails gave the Democratic convention a rocky start, threatening a bid to reunify the party after a bitter primary campaign. Even so, a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday showed Clinton leading Republican rival Donald Trump by 6 percentage points. Nearly 41 percent of likely voters favor Clinton, 35 percent favor Trump, and 25 percent picked other, according to the new July 25-29 online poll of 1,043 likely voters, which overlapped with the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. After a speech Thursday night in which she became the first woman to accept a major partys presidential nomination, Clinton launched a three-day bus tour of Ohio and Pennsylvania, which like other Rust Belt states have been hit by the decline in U.S. manufacturing.  Clinton and her vice presidential running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, on Friday attended a rally at Philadelphias Temple University, toured a factory in Hatfield and ended the day in Harrisburg. They will continue onto Ohio on Saturday and Sunday.  Clinton is likely to face a tough challenge in such states from Trump, a New York businessman who is trying to win white working-class voters with rhetoric blasting free trade and illegal immigration. Clinton and Kaine are using the Rust Belt tour to highlight manufacturing successes and discuss how they plan to boost wages for the middle class. In the process they aim to contrast their vision for the country with the one offered by Trump. If youre looking for a kind of pessimistic, downbeat vision of America, were not your folks, Clinton said in Hatfield. We do not buy into that dark, divisive, image that was presented at the Republican convention last week. Opinion polls show a potentially tight race in Ohio and Pennsylvania, both of which President Barack Obama won in the 2012 election. The differences are stark, Kaine said in Harrisburg. Clinton and Trump are essentially tied in Ohio, where the Republicans held their convention last week, according to an average of polls by RealClearPolitics. Clinton has a lead of 4.4 percentage points in Pennsylvania, the websites average of recent polls showed. Ohio and to a lesser extent Pennsylvania are among a handful of competitive states traditionally viewed as decisive in presidential elections, because they do not lean heavily Democratic or Republican. In her speech on Thursday, Clinton, 68, a former first lady and U.S. senator, promised to make the United States a country that works for everyone if she is elected. We are clear-eyed about what our country is up against. But we are not afraid, she said. Clinton portrayed Trump as a threat to the country, saying, A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.   Trump, 70, sent out a flurry of comments on Twitter on Friday morning lambasting media coverage of the speech as a joke, calling the address very long and very boring and accusing Clinton of wanting to shut down coal mines, steel plants and any other remaining manufacturing.  He campaigned in another swing state, Colorado, on Friday and was scheduled to visit Ohio next week.  The U.S. television audience for Clintons acceptance speech was smaller than the viewership of Trumps address a week earlier, according to ratings data released on Friday. An estimated 29.8 million people watched Clinton across 10 broadcast and cable networks, Nielsen data showed. Trump drew 32.2 million viewers in his July 21 address at the Republican National Convention.     Economic issues will be crucial as the White House campaign enters its final three-month stretch. The U.S. economy grew by only 1.2 percent in the second quarter, far less than expected, the Commerce Department said on Friday.  During the Rust Belt trip, Clinton will detail her pledge to raise wages and create jobs by unveiling a major infrastructure package within the first 100 days of her presidency, and encouraging companies to invest in workers.    The start of the Democratic convention was overshadowed by the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who quit over leaked emails showing party officials favored Clinton over her primary rival Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator of Vermont. Cyber security experts and U.S. officials said on Monday there was evidence that Russia engineered the release of the  emails in order to influence the election. The Kremlin has denied the accusations. Yet another hack came to light on Thursday, when four people familiar with the matter told Reuters that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating a cyber attack against the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which raises money for Democrats running for the U.S. House of Representatives. The DCCC confirmed on Friday that it had been the target of a cyber security incident.  ",politicsNews,"July 25, 2016 ",1
Federal judge strikes down parts of Wisconsin voter laws,"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday struck down a string of Wisconsin voting restrictions passed by the Republican-led legislature and ordered the state to revamp its voter identification rules, finding that they disenfranchised minority voters. U.S. District Judge James Peterson, ruling in a legal challenge to the laws by two liberal groups, said he could not overturn the entire voter ID law because a federal appeals court had already found such restrictions to be constitutional. But Peterson, in his 119-page ruling, said the requirements that Wisconsin voters show either a photo identification or go through a special petition process had unfairly burdened minorities and needed to be reformed or replaced before the November presidential election. To put it bluntly, Wisconsins strict version of voter ID law is a cure worse than the disease, the judge wrote.  Peterson left the voting rules intact for the Aug 9. primary elections for federal, state and local offices, saying to change them less than two weeks in advance would be disruptive.  But his ruling was expected to impact the November presidential election in Wisconsin, which could prove a crucial battleground state for Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. Peterson also struck down as unconstitutional limits on in-person absentee voting, residency requirements and a ban on using expired student identification. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said in a tweet that he was disappointed in the decision by an activist federal judge and expected to file an appeal. A spokesman for One Wisconsin Institute, one of the two groups which filed the challenge, hailed Petersons ruling as a huge win not only for the plaintiffs but for democracy itself.  Wisconsin is one of several Republican-led states that have passed such voter ID laws in recent years amid fear of fraudulent voting by illegal immigrants and others.  Among the nine states with the strictest laws, insisting on state-issued photo identification for voters, are Georgia, Indiana, Texas and Virginia. A U.S. appeals court judge earlier this month ruled the Texas law discriminatory. The judge sent the case back to the lower court to examine whether the law had a discriminatory purpose and also asked the court for a short-term fix for the November general election. Republicans say voter ID laws are needed to prevent voter fraud. Democrats say the laws are really intended to make it harder for poor African-Americans and Latinos, who tend to vote Democrat, to vote. ",politicsNews,"July 29, 2016 ",1
U.S. Air Force asks industry for proposals to replace nuclear missiles,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force asked industry on Friday for proposals to replace the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile and the nuclear cruise missile as the military moves ahead with a costly modernization of its aging atomic weapons systems. The Air Force said in a statement it expected to award up to two contracts for a new ICBM weapons system, or ground-based strategic deterrent, sometime next summer or fall. It also expected to award up to two contracts in the same time frame for a new nuclear cruise missile, or long-range standoff weapon. Modernization of the U.S. nuclear force is expected to cost more than $350 billion over the next decade as the United States works to replace its aging systems, including bombs, nuclear bombers, missiles and submarines. Some analysts estimate the cost of modernization at $1 trillion over 30 years. The new ICBM system would be a follow-on to the Minuteman missile, whose launch systems and physical infrastructure first became operational in the mid-1960s. The system has been upgraded over the years, but much of the infrastructure is original, the Air Force said. The most recent versions of the Minuteman III date from the late 1990s and early 2000s and had an intended 20-year life span, the Air Force said. The missile will face increased operational and sustainment challenges until it can be replaced, it said. This request for proposals is the next step to ensuring the nations ICBM leg of the nuclear triad remains safe, secure and effective, said Major General Scott Jansson, who leads the Air Force program office for strategic systems. Opponents of replacing the nuclear cruise missile have argued that its missions could be handled by other legs of the triad. Others say it is an unnecessary expense at a time of shrinking budgets and smaller deployed nuclear arsenals. The military insists the new cruise missile is needed to enable older bombers to deliver nuclear weapons to targets whose air space is heavily defended and difficult to reach with gravity bombs. The missile is needed to replace the aging air launched cruise missile, which has far exceeded its originally planned service life ... and is required to support our B-52 bomber fleet, Admiral Cecil Haney, the head of U.S. Strategic Command, told lawmakers earlier this year.

U.S. worried about hunger-striking Cuban dissidents: State Department,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is concerned about the physical well-being of hunger-striking activists in Cuba and is closely watching their situation, the U.S. State Department said on Friday. We stand in solidarity with those who advocate for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly, State Department spokesman John Kirby told a briefing. We have raised our concerns directly with the Cuban government, both in Washington and Havana, he added. Kirby said Washington was particularly concerned about the health of dissidents Carlos Amel Oliva, who leads the youth wing of a Cuban dissident group, and Guillermo Farinas.  Farinas began a hunger strike earlier this month calling, for Raul Castros government to end torture and human rights abuses. He was taken to Arnaldo Milian Castro Hospital in the city of Santa Clara on Thursday after becoming extremely weak and fainting eight days into the strike, The Miami Herald reported. Farinas and about 20 other rights activists are on hunger-strike in Cuba. ",politicsNews,"July 29, 2016 ",1
U.S. court rejects NJ Senator Menendez's bid to end corruption case,"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Friday refused to dismiss a corruption indictment against Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, rejecting the Democrats claim that the U.S. Constitution shielded him from prosecution. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said prosecutors could pursue charges that Menendez accepted campaign donations and gifts, including a stay in a Caribbean villa and private jet flights from a wealthy friend, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, in exchange for using his office to lobby on his behalf. Members of Congress are not to be super-citizens immune from criminal liability, Circuit Judge Thomas Ambro wrote for a three-judge panel of the Philadelphia-based appeals court. Fridays decision means the case could eventually be headed for trial, and could complicate Democrats efforts to regain control of the U.S. Senate after the Nov. 8 election. If Menendez, 62, were forced to give up the seat he has held since 2006, Governor Chris Christie, a Republican, could under New Jersey law appoint a temporary replacement. The senator has pledged to stay in office while defending himself, but has given up his post as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Abbe Lowell, Menendezs lawyer, said the senator intends to ask the entire appeals court to review Fridays decision, and, if necessary, appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The decision is another step in the legal process that, at the end of the day, will show that Senator Menendez has always acted in accordance with the law, Lowell said in a statement. The Senator remains confident that he will be vindicated. Peter Carr, a U.S. Department of Justice spokesman, declined to comment. In an indictment unveiled in April 2015, Menendez was accused of accepting bribes from Melgen in exchange for interceding in various matters on his friends behalf. Prosecutors said these included an $8.9 million Medicare billing dispute, and a contract dispute with the Dominican Republic in which Menendez encouraged the State Department to intervene. Menendez and Melgen have pleaded not guilty to the respective charges they faced in the 22-count indictment. Last September, U.S. District Judge William Walls in Newark, New Jersey, dismissed four bribery counts but left most of the governments case intact. In his appeal, Menendez argued that his actions were protected by the Constitutions speech or debate clause, which offers broad protection to members of Congress against prosecution for actions they undertake as legislators. Ambro, however, said Menendezs actions amounted to essentially lobbying on behalf of a particular party, and thus outside the safe harbor provided in the Constitution. There is a sufficient basis for the district courts conclusion that the predominant purpose of the challenged acts was to pursue a political resolution to Dr. Melgens disputes, Ambro wrote. It was not to engage in true legislative oversight or otherwise influence broad matters of policy. Lowell had argued that Walls should have focused on what actually went on at the meetings in question, saying the record reflected that high-level policy discussions had taken place. Ambro said Menendez remains free to argue that his efforts were directed toward influencing policy, and the government still has the burden at trial of proving otherwise. The evidence in favor of Senator Menendez will no doubt channel forcefully his position at trial, the judge wrote. Fridays decision came one month after the Supreme Court unanimously overturned the bribery convictions of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell. That court said routine political activities such as arranging meetings or reaching out to public officials generally could not form a basis for criminal prosecutions. The 3rd Circuit focused mainly on the speech or debate clause, and did not mention McDonnell. Lowell said that case raised important issues that need to be addressed. The case is U.S. v. Menendez, 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-3459. ",politicsNews,"July 29, 2016 ",1
Democratic fund-raising group for Congress candidates confirms hack,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A committee that raises money for Democratic candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives confirmed on Friday it had been hacked in an intrusion possibly linked to Russian hackers, similar to an earlier breach targeting another Democratic Party group. In an incident that escalated concerns about the potential for Russian meddling in U.S. politics, Reuters first reported on Thursday that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing the hack at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC. The intrusion took place from at least June 19 to June 27, though it may have been longer, according to analysis conducted by U.S. network security company FireEye.  The committee said in a statement it has hired cyber security firm CrowdStrike to investigate. We have taken and are continuing to take steps to enhance the security of our network, the committee said. We are cooperating with federal law enforcement with respect to their ongoing investigation. The DCCC hack may be related to an earlier hack against the Democratic National Committee, which raises money and sets strategy for Democratic candidates nationwide. The DNC and DCCC occupy the same office building in Washington. Potential links to Russian hackers in both incidents were likely to heighten accusations, so far unproven, that Moscow is trying to meddle in the U.S. presidential election campaign to help Republican nominee Donald Trump. The Kremlin denied involvement in the DNC cyber attack. In June, a bogus website was registered with a name resembling a DCCC donation site. For some time, donation-related internet traffic that was supposed to go to a donation-processing firm instead went to the fake site. The DCCC intrusion may have been used to compromise the computer systems of donors who visited the spoof site, rather than to collect their personal information, said John Hultquist, manager of cyber espionage analysis at FireEye. Several major Democratic donors contacted by Reuters on Friday said they had not been notified of the hack and were not concerned about their information being accessed.  Im less concerned about that than I am about my Amex being hacked, said John Morgan, 60, a Florida attorney. Cindy Miscikowski, 68, a California donor, said she would be upset if hackers got her bank information, but otherwise she was not worried because donations are disclosed publicly.    The timeframe of the DCCC hack would place it days after the DNC went public with its breach and said the hackers had been kicked out of its systems.  Sources said the numerical Internet address of the spurious DCCC site resembled one used by a Russian government-linked hacking group, one of two suspected in the DNC breach. Rich Barger, co-founder of security intelligence firm ThreatConnect Inc, said his analysis of the fake donation site tied it to the group linked to Russian military intelligence.  He said the web domain name was set up through a service that accepts bitcoin, with a contact email address that had been used to set up websites involved in a major German hack, which also was attributed to the Russian group. Cyber experts and U.S. officials said this week there was evidence that Russia engineered the DNC hack to release sensitive party emails and influence U.S. politics. The DNC hack raised concerns among Democrats at the partys convention in Philadelphia, where Hillary Clinton was nominated as the partys candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The new hack at the DCCC could add pressure on the Obama administration to make a public accusation or retaliate. The Justice Department and other agencies have said it is important for deterrence to name and shame cyber adversaries. Any efforts on a nation states part to interfere with U.S. politics through cyber attacks would appear to cross a line that would demand a response from the U.S. government, said D.J. Rosenthal, a former Justice Department and National Security Council official. A former White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said any formal accusation would require overwhelmingly certain evidence. Staffers for the Republican National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said separately that those campaign organizing groups had not been hacked.

Obama to showcase TPP after trade deal demonized in campaign,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - During a visit from Singapores prime minister on Tuesday, President Barack Obama will extol the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal and commit to getting the deal done, a top White House official said on Friday, even though Obamas fellow Democrats panned it at their convention this week.  Obama wants the U.S. Congress to approve the 12-nation trade deal, which he sees as a central part of his economic and foreign policy legacy, before he leaves the White House on Jan. 20. Free trade deals have been blamed for U.S. manufacturing plant closures, job losses and stagnant wages. Obama has cast the TPP as righting the wrongs of past trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. Both countries also are part of the TPP. Both Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump oppose the TPP, and it has become a hot-button issue in the campaign to replace Obama. Congressional leaders have been pessimistic about the odds of ratifying the deal either during the short session in September, or during the brief lame duck session after the Nov. 8 election. When Obama rolls out the red carpet for Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Tuesday, one of the main goals will be lifting up the benefits of the TPP, said Daniel Kritenbrink, top Asia policy adviser at the White House National Security Council. I predict he will also once again say to the prime minister that hes committed to getting TPP done and doing so before the end of his term, Kritenbrink told reporters on Friday. TPP is going to be great for the American economy, for American workers and American companies, Kritenbrink said, noting Singapore, a signatory to the deal, strongly supports it. Trump has argued vociferously against multinational trade deals like TPP, saying he would prefer instead to have deals with specific countries one on one. On Thursday night at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Trump said TPP should be rejected. I like trade where the United States makes a lot of money, he said. Trump has been critical of Clinton, Obamas former secretary of state, and her vice presidential running mate Tim Kaine, for shifting their positions to oppose the trade deal. Signs protesting the deal were prominent during the Democratic convention, which wrapped up on Thursday. Kaine, a Democratic senator who had praised the TPP deal until he joined Clintons ticket, told CNN on Friday that he was concerned the deal gives corporations the power to challenge trade practices, but not unions or environmental groups. The deal is going to come up for a vote and I cant vote for it with these secret courts that are open to the companies only, Kaine said in the interview. Obama is acutely aware of the difficult election year politics for the TPP but that will not stop him from forging ahead, White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters on Friday. The president absolutely believes this deal should pass this year, Schultz said. ",politicsNews,"July 29, 2016 ",1

"U.S., Cuba hold 'substantive' second round talks on claims","WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - The United States and Cuba have concluded a substantive second round of talks on multibillion-dollar claims against one another in Washington and agreed to hold more regular meetings on the matter, a State Department Official said on Friday. The former Cold War foes had a first meeting outlining their respective claims in December in Havana as part of a deepening detente. The issue is one of the key and complex obstacles to normalization of relations between the two countries. The second meeting was more substantive both in exploring more details about claims that need to be resolved but also in reviewing the practices of both countries in solving claims, the State Department official told reporters on condition of anonymity. Both sides agreed they would have more regular meetings. There is no set date yet for the next meeting, which will place in Havana, in accordance with bilateral protocol, the official said. Cuba wants at least $121 billion in reparations for economic damages caused by the U.S. trade embargo and at least $181 billion for human damages. The United States has awarded its firms and individuals $1.9 billion worth of claims against Cuba for factories, farms, homes and other assets that were nationalized on the island after Fidel Castros rebels came to power in 1959. Those claims are now roughly worth $8 billion when including 6 percent annual interest.  The Cuban government has reached settlements with other countries for expropriated assets but it cut off negotiations with the United States when bilateral relations soured in the 1960s. Many of the nationalized companies no longer exist and individual claims have been passed to heirs. The State Department official said the United States also is claiming $2.2 billion for court judgments outstanding against Cuba and hundreds of millions for former government mining interests on the island. Cubas Foreign Ministry said in a statement the two countries had continued sharing information on their respective claims with the aim of preparing the process of negotiation.

The year of 'Neither': Why Reuters/Ipsos is tweaking its U.S. presidential poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - In a presidential campaign notable for its negativity, the option of Neither candidate appears to be an appealing alternative, at least to participants in the Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll. Many voters on both sides have been ambivalent in their support for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump, complicating the task of the pollsters trying to track the race. That sentiment may help explain an apparent skew that recently emerged in the Reuters/Ipsos poll results. Given the choice, a relatively large group of voters opted for Neither/Other candidate compared with other major polls, leading to an underreporting of several percentage points for one or other of the two major contenders at times in the race. As a result, Reuters/Ipsos is amending the wording of the choiceandeliminating the word Neither, bringing the option in line with other polls.      The amended Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll will be published later Friday, available at polling.reuters.com.  From the beginning of June until the middle of July, the Reuters/Ipsossurveyshowed consistently lower support for Trump than otherpolls were capturing.At times, the Reuters/Ipsos poll showedClinton with a leadover Trump as wide as about 12 percentage points among registered voters -five percentage points higher than Clintons leadin some other comparable polls. To determine the cause, the pollsters examined what made the Reuters/Ipsos poll different.Their conclusion: By giving respondents the option of Neither/Other, the survey appears tohave captured greater numbers of ambivalent voters unwilling to commit to either candidate than other major polls, which only offer the choice of Other. During the period analyzed, the historicallyhigh antipathy for both major candidates,paired with the option of selecting Neither/Other, meant the Reuters/Ipsos poll probablyunderreportedTrumps support before the Republican convention, perhaps by 3 to 5 percentage points.  More recently, the Neither/Other optionappearedto lead to an underreporting ofClintons support in the run-up to the Democratic convention, said Cliff Young, pollster and president of Ipsos Public Affairs, which partners with Reuters on the poll. The pollsters estimated the Clinton shortfall at 2 to 4 percentage points. Tom W. Smith, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Society at the University of Chicago, said the earlier Trump numbers in the Reuters/Ipsos poll could have indicated a softness of support for Trump among a relatively small group of conservative voters who had yet to come to terms with his candidacy. It is plausible that a similar effect among Democratic voters may be hitting Clinton now when presented with the option of Neither, he said. And the skews displayed by the Neither phenomenon may indicate there is a chance for some gains among alternative party candidates, Smith said. Tim Mclheny, a 47-year-old civil servant from Vermont who describes himself as a moderate Republican, is a case in point.When asked in the Reuters/Ipsos poll who he will vote for in November, he skipped both Trump and Clinton and opted for Neither/Other. It is the lesser of two evils, Mclheny said.He said he will cast his ballot for the candidate he believes will do the best for civil servants.Ultimately, however,he saidhe may well grudgingly opt for Trump come November. Heres how the pollsters reviewed their methodology and decided to drop Neither. Ipsos tested three alternate versions of the presidential preference questions on different groups in a survey and compared those results to the outcome of the established version of the tracking poll. That test found eliminating the word Neither from the Neither/Other response increased Trump support by between 3 to 5 percentage points on any given day leading up to the Republican convention. It also increased Clintons support, but by a smaller margin.spotlight.ipsos-na.com/?p=5574 Since the convention, however, Trumps support seems to have solidified among wary supporters. Now,the Neither issue appears to be affecting Clinton in the survey. On Tuesday, for example, the established tracking poll had the candidates tied at 38 percent each. A 13-point lead for Clinton on July 14 had vanishedin two weeks. (polling.reuters.com/#poll/TM651Y15_13/filters/PD1:1/dates/20160701-20160726/type/smallest) But eliminating Neither from the Neither/Other answer produced a different result. In that case, Clinton was ahead, 40 percent to 36 percent, on Tuesday.  When asked the question in the new way, 11 percent of voters opted for Other. By comparison, 14 percent opted for Neither/Other in the version of the survey that showed the race tied. The three-point gap suggests the Neither phenomenon was now working against Clinton. In the nearly five years Reuters/Ipsos has been offering the Neither/Other option to respondents in presidential polling, it has never yielded such a skew. The results highlight how poll designs and methodologies can yield significantly differing results, and how important differences can emerge from the way a question is framed. The Economist/YouGov poll, like the Reuters/Ipsos survey, is conducted online. It uses a similar battery of questions, but does not offer the Neither/Other option, just Other. In Economist/YouGovs July 17 poll, Clinton was ahead by 4 percentage points among registered voters, with Trump at 41 percent. The NBC News/SurveyMonkey online poll gives three options: Clinton, Trump, or No Answer, which more firmly prods respondents to make a choice. In their July 17 poll, Clinton led Trump by one point, 46 to 45, among registered voters. Telephone polls tend to ask voter preference as an open-ended question, or just offer respondents the choice of the Democratic and Republican candidates. Among phone polls, such as the ABC News/Washington Post and NBC/Wall Street Journal surveys, Clinton recently led by four to five points. The CBS/New York Times telephone poll of registered voters had the race tied at 40 percent each. The Reuters/Ipsos presidential-preference poll result and other results in the survey are updated twice a week. ",politicsNews,"July 29, 2016 ",1
Exclusive: FBI probes hacking of Democratic congressional group - sources," SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI is investigating a cyber attack against another U.S. Democratic Party group, which may be related to an earlier hack against the Democratic National Committee, four people familiar with the matter told Reuters.  The previously unreported incident at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC, and its potential ties to Russian hackers are likely to heighten accusations, so far unproven, that Moscow is trying to meddle in the U.S. presidential election campaign to help Republican nominee Donald Trump.  DONT MISS: Alphabet and Amazon wind up 'smokin'' quarter for big tech Why Russian pump prices rise as oil prices fall Democratic campaign group for Congress confirms computer hack The Kremlin denied involvement in the DCCC cyber-attack. Hacking of the partys emails caused discord among Democrats at the partys convention in Philadelphia to nominate Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate.  The newly disclosed breach at the DCCC may have been intended to gather information about donors, rather than to steal money, the sources said on Thursday.  It was not clear what data was exposed, although donors typically submit a variety of personal information including names, email addresses and credit card details when making a contribution. It was also unclear if stolen information was used to hack into other systems.  The DCCC raises money for Democrats running for seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. The intrusion at the group could have begun as recently as June, two of the sources told Reuters.  That was when a bogus website was registered with a name closely resembling that of a main donation site connected to the DCCC. For some time, internet traffic associated with donations that was supposed to go to a company that processes campaign donations instead went to the bogus site, two sources said.  The sources said the Internet Protocol address of the spurious site resembled one used by Russian government-linked hackers suspected in the breach of the DNC, the body that sets strategy and raises money for the Democratic Party nationwide.  Cyber security experts and U.S. officials have said there was evidence that Russia engineered the DNC hack to release sensitive party emails in order to influence the U.S. presidential election.  I have concerns that an agency of foreign intelligence is hacking and interfering with a U.S. election, said Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, who added he had not seen news of the DCCC attack.  Asked by Reuters to comment on whether Russia played a role in a cyber-attack on the DCCC, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: We dont see the point any more in repeating yet again that this is silliness.  The release of the DNC emails by activist group WikiLeaks caused uproar in the party because they appeared to show favoritism within the DNC for Clinton over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who ran a close race for the nomination for the Nov. 8 election. The committee is supposed to be neutral.  The DNC and the DCCC share the same office space on South Capitol Street in Washington.  The DCCC and donation processing company ActBlue had no comment on Thursday. CrowdStrike, the California-based cyber security firm that investigated the DNC breach, declined to comment.  Justin Harvey, chief security officer at Fidelis Cybersecurity company, said the suspect website in the hack was affiliated with others that host sophisticated malware undetected by the vast majority of antivirus providers.  Its really rare malware, which would be more likely to be wielded by government hackers than ordinary criminals, he said.  Russian officials have dismissed allegations of Moscows involvement in hacks of U.S. political groups. It is so absurd it borders on total stupidity, Kremlin spokesman Peskov said on Thursday.  Some Democratic officials have accused Russia of hacking the DNC emails in order to help Trump win the race for the White House.  Its no coincidence someone is hacking into Democratic Party computers. Its almost sounding like a repeat of Watergate, Gilberto Hinojosa, the chairman of the Texas Democrats said, after Reuters reported the DCCC hacking.  This is just the kind of dirty politics we expect from Donald Trump. I have no doubt Donald Trump is behind it, he said, citing the businessmans praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin and recent remarks about Russia and Clintons deleted emails.  Trump angered Democrats this week by inviting Russia to unearth tens of thousands of emails from rival Clintons tenure as U.S. secretary of state. Trump said on Thursday his comment was meant to be sarcastic.  Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist who once worked for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, said the possibility of the DCCC being hacked was cause for great concern.  Until proven otherwise, I would suggest that everyone involved with the campaign committee operate under the assumption Russians have access to everything in their computer systems, Manley said.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation referred questions about the DCCC attack to a statement it made on Monday about the DNC hack:  The FBI is investigating a cyber intrusion involving the DNC and are working to determine the nature and scope of the matter. A compromise of this nature is something we take very seriously, and the FBI will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace.  Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said on Thursday the U.S. intelligence community was not ready to make the call on attribution as to who was responsible for the DNC hack.  Clapper, speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, acknowledged: Theres just a few usual suspects out there who might be responsible for the cyber intrusion, suggesting it was the work of a state actor rather than an independent hacking group.  Clapper said in May he was aware of attempted hacks on campaigns and related groups and he expected to see more as the November election neared. The last two U.S. presidential cycles in 2008 and 2012 witnessed a barrage of cyber attacks from a range of adversaries targeting President Barack Obamas campaign and the campaigns of his Republican foes, officials have said.

Killing TPP would hand China 'keys to the castle': U.S. trade representative,"LIMA (Reuters) - Failure to ratify the U.S.-led sweeping trade pact TPP would hand China the keys to the castle on globalization and do nothing to solve the real problems underlying American anxiety over jobs, the top U.S. trade official said Thursday. The tariff-slashing Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) has turned into a hot-button topic in the run-up to the Nov. 8 U.S. election, threatening to dampen support from lawmakers needed to pass a deal critics condemn as a job-killer. U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said he was still optimistic Congress would pass the 12-member TPP, in part because China has been moving ahead with a trade deal of its own, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), that would boost its exports and let it set labor and environmental standards in the fast-growing Asia Pacific region. Were one vote away from either cementing our leadership in this region and in the global trading system or ceding it to China, Froman told reporters in Lima after attending the inauguration of Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.  At the end of the day I dont think Congress wants to be responsible for handing the keys to the castle to China. Fromans defense of the TPP follows weeks of heated attacks on the deal as anti-TPP chants and signs have peppered the Republican and Democratic conventions. Republican nominee Donald Trump has called the TPP a death blow for manufacturing jobs and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has firmed up her opposition to it in recent days. Froman declined to comment on the candidates but said the TPP had become a scapegoat for legitimate concerns over income inequality, stagnant wages and jobs lost to automation. You dont get to vote on the next generation of robots, he said, you get to vote on trade agreements. But the debate over TPP has also helped broaden support for domestic policies, such as infrastructure development and educational programs, to help Americans adapt to rapid economic change, Froman said. U.S. President Barack Obama wants the TPP passed this year. Froman ruled out renegotiating the carefully balanced text, but said issues were being solved by working on country implementation plans. He cited pork producers, dairy farmers and financial services as once-reluctant stakeholders that now back the TPP. The last major issue outstanding has to do with biologics and intellectual property rights, Froman said. Were having good constructive conversations with members of Congress.

"Daughter Chelsea casts Clinton as great mom, driven public servant","PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Chelsea Clinton took the stage of the Democratic National Convention on Thursday to portray her mother Hillary Clinton as a loving, smart and playful woman qualified to be elected president of the United States.   In a 12-minute introduction received warmly in a packed Philadelphia arena, Chelsea Clinton countered criticism that her mother is an untrustworthy politician who struggles to show compassion in front of American voters. Shes a woman driven by compassion, by faith, by a fierce sense of justice and a heart full of love, the only child of presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton and former U.S. President Bill Clinton told the crowd. Hillary Clinton took the stage minutes later to become the first woman to accept the presidential nomination of a major U.S. party.  Chelsea Clinton, a 36-year-old mother of two, was the last in a series of speakers at the four-day gathering who sought to cast Hillary Clinton in a familial light ahead of the Nov. 8 election against Republican Donald Trump. She called her mother a wonderful, thoughtful, hilarious person who made time during her childhood to attend dance and piano recitals, and to gaze at the sky with her to find shapes in the clouds. That feeling of being valued and loved, thats what my mom wants for every child. It is the calling of her life, Chelsea Clinton said. President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden had also given speeches supporting Clinton, casting her as qualified for the Oval Office because of her experience as a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady, but also because of her loyalty and passion. Chelsea Clinton, who has been in the public eye since her childhood in the White House, took a low profile after her father left office in 2001. She married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky and served as vice chair of the Clinton Foundation charity. After her mothers presidential bid she re-entered public life to hit the campaign trail, endearing herself to supporters with stories of Clinton as a mother and grandmother to her children, Charlotte, aged 2 come September, and Aidan, born in June. Trump has also relied on his children to soften his image. His eldest daughter Ivanka spoke at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last week, depicting the New York businessman as color-blind and gender-neutral to counter critics who have called his comments about immigrants and women bigoted and callous. Both candidates children say they are friends, a relationship they struck up before their parents launched campaigns for the White House. ",politicsNews,"July 29, 2016 ",1
"For inspiration, new Democratic stars look to Elizabeth Warren","PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Twelve years ago, Barack Obamas electrifying speech at the Democratic National Convention brought tears to Andrew Gillums eyes. Now mayor of Tallahassee, Florida, and viewed as a rising star in that state, Gillum did not hesitate when asked to name his political role model.  Elizabeth Warren, he replied, referring to the firebrand U.S. senator from Massachusetts.  That the 37-year-old African-American mayor of a Southern U.S. city identifies Warren as his political lodestar speaks volumes about the Democratic Partys progressive shift, even as Hillary Clinton officially became its presidential nominee after a quarter-century in the public eye. With the party in transition, Clintons 1990s-era brand of Democratic centrism is slowly being eclipsed by a wave of progressivism personified by Warren and by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, a rival of Clintons until he endorsed her this month. Although Sanders insurgent presidential bid fell short, leaving his supporters bitterly disappointed, a new crop of Democratic candidates seems determined to carry on his work, with Warren, 67, as their putative leader.  Like Obama in 2004, Gillum and many others at the Philadelphia convention sought to boost their profiles, raise cash and network with fellow Democrats, buoyed by the adoption of the most progressive platform in party history, with planks for debt-free college, expanded Social Security benefits and a tax on carbon emissions. Clinton, too, has moved to the left, embracing many of these causes, separating herself from a more moderate brand of Democratic politics personified by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who was pro-free trade, friendlier to Wall Street and emphasized budget discipline.  She appealed to Sanders supporters during her speech accepting the partys presidential nomination on Thursday, pledging to work with him on progressive issues. Lets go out there and make it happen together, Clinton said.  Sarah Lloyd, 44, a congressional candidate in Wisconsin who supported Sanders, said, There is an energy thats coming from the folks that were brought to the process by the Sanders campaign.... That can only be a positive thing for the party. More than Sanders, Warren has taken the lead in shaping the Democrats next generation. Formerly a professor of law, Warren conceived and set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau formed in 2011 under President Obama. She launched a political action committee to back Democratic candidates and inspired other advocacy groups, such as the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, to solicit donations to a bloc it terms the partys Warren wing. A speaker at the convention, Floridas Gillum was frustrated by Sanders because he seemed disinterested in helping other Democratic candidates, in contrast with Warren.  Senator Sanders was content to be a movement by himself, Gillum said. Its a revolution when you bring people along with you.  Warrens committee has donated to the campaigns of U.S. Senate hopefuls such as Kamala Harris, 51, of California, Jason Kander, 35, of Missouri, and Catherine Cortez Masto, 52, of Nevada. They and Wisconsins Lloyd oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the global trade deal that has split the progressive and moderate elements of the party. The PCCCs slate of Warren wing candidates supports a $15-an-hour minimum wage, campaign-finance reform and tighter rules for Wall Street.  One of those on the slate is Zephyr Teachout, a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in New York, who has campaigned in a T-shirt that reads, Im from the Elizabeth Warren wing of the party and who has been endorsed by Sanders.  There is a rising and very important populism, talking about money in politics, talking about trade, talking about economic issues, Teachout, 44, told Reuters. Within the party, and across the board, there has been a serious rethinking of trade, rethinking of big banks, rethinking of monopolies that have too much power. Tulsi Gabbard, a U.S. representative from Hawaii, is often mentioned by Sanders supporters as one who could assume his mantle. A cable-news regular, Gabbard, 35, was one of a few Sanders supporters offered a convention speaking slot. Onstage she formally nominated Sanders for president, saying he had become a voice for millions, connecting seamlessly with laborers in the Rust Belt and environmentalists in the West. Other rising Democratic progressives frequently cited by strategists include Julian Castro, 41, the U.S. housing secretary, and his twin brother, Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas, former Ohio state senator Nina Turner, 48, U.S. Senate candidate Pramila Jayapal, 50, of Washington, and former South Carolina lawmaker Bakari Sellers, 31. Harris might be the one to shine the brightest. As Californias attorney general, Harris has been mentioned as a potential U.S. presidential candidate or U.S. Supreme Court justice should she win her Senate race in November. She enjoys the support of Warren, Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and former New York City Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, a Republican-turned-independent, suggesting she can appeal to both the partys liberal and moderate flanks.  She joined forces with Bloomberg in his crusade for tighter gun laws, bonded with Warren over helping homeowners struggling through the foreclosure crisis of the late 2000s and joined Obamas efforts to overhaul a criminal justice system that tends to treat black citizens more harshly than white ones. In one campaign ad, Warren is viewed saying, Kamala Harris was fearless. Harris, in turn, has backed Clinton. In an interview, she rejected the idea that the party is leaving Clinton behind even as it nominates her for president.  I strongly believe that these two generations have much more in common than what separates them in terms of fundamental values, Harris said. ",politicsNews,"July 28, 2016 ",1
"Among Democrats, another convention hums in Sanders fans' phones","PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - There is the Democratic convention unfolding onstage in Philadelphia this week, broadcast to millions on television. Then there is a second convention that exists largely hidden from public view in the smartphones of Bernie Sanders delegates. Using various messaging apps and secret Facebook groups, many of the delegates pledged to the U.S. senator and runner-up in the partys presidential nomination contest have been coordinating among themselves in Philadelphia.  This is where they debate how to show their opposition to Hillary Clinton, who will formally accept her nomination on Thursday as the Democratic Partys candidate for the Nov. 8 election but who is viewed by many left-leaning Sanders supporters as too moderate. There are arguments, flashes of paranoia and conspiracy as well. The messages often fly around too quickly to track. It makes your head explode, all these different apps, said Jessica Chambers, a Sanders delegate from Wyoming. She added one group using the Slack messaging app had more than 600 delegates. She poked at her iPhone, which had overheated and blacked out. The clearest sign of the networks power came on Tuesday evening, when at least 100 Sanders delegates quietly walked out in protest at Clinton becoming the nominee, after word of the plan spread through smartphones about an hour in advance. At the time, Chambers was sitting near her Clinton-supporting friend Shelby Read, who said she is amused by the secrecy of the Sanders crew but supportive of their dissent.  I never know what theyre doing, Read told her friend later. I thought people were going out to get food. Many of the smartphone debates revolve around the question: What Would Bernie Do? But even when Sanders himself has weighed in, sending a mass text and email to his delegates on Monday evening urging against booing and back-turning, it is not always seen as an authoritative answer.     Ignore that message, one skeptical recipient wrote in a message. Bernie did not write it. Express yourselves freely.  The dissent in Philadelphia was fueled by leaked emails last week that showed the Democratic Party leadership tried to undermine Sanders during the primary campaign. In the streets of Philadelphia, thousands of angry left-wing protesters, including Sanders supporters, have marched, with some burning flags. As hails of boos grew from the convention floor on Monday evening, despite Sanders call for decorum, one delegate sent a warning around: Stop booing and misrepresenting Bernie and the campaign, it read. The replies bristled. We dont tell each other what to do, ran one.         Secrecy is encouraged among the members of the smartphone chat groups, and so delegates who showed messages to Reuters did so on condition of anonymity. They are wary of the party or security officials thwarting their plans. The closest thing to a leadership structure is Coalition of 57, a small group of delegates that came together in the weeks before the convention. Members say they are in contact with officials in the Sanders campaign, but remain independent. Jeff Weaver, Sanders campaign manager, said he was not in contact with Coalition of 57, but otherwise declined to discuss the delegates networks.  Coalition of 57 delegates were among those who, with mixed results, sought to tamp down the boos this week, suggesting instead to withhold cheers and applause, or wordlessly hold up protest signs during certain speakers. Let the silence be deafening, Dani Pellett, a coalition member for the Texas delegation, said.     ",politicsNews,"July 29, 2016 ",1
Exclusive: Billionaire Republican donors urge Kochs to back Trump,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of at least six wealthy Republican donors is urging the billionaire Koch brothers to step off the sidelines of the U.S. presidential election to back Donald Trump, arguing they will want influence with the New York businessman they have harshly criticized if he wins the White House in November. The financiers, prominent members of the sprawling 700-member Koch donor network, have been making their case in emails and phone calls to Charles and David Koch ahead of their bi-annual donor seminar, which begins Saturday in Colorado, according to four donors involved in the loosely-coordinated effort and advisers representing two others. An endorsement from the Kochs would be a radical departure: The industrialist brothers have railed against Trumps monstrous rhetoric and protectionist policies on immigration and trade. They have said they will not get involved in the presidential election and will instead focus on Senate races.  All the while, Trump has blasted the donor class and vowed not to become a puppet of outside interests as he campaigns to win the Nov. 8 election.  But there is room for a detente.  Trumps vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, has long been a darling of the Koch network, and Trumps fledgling campaign finance operation could use a cash injection as it faces a $1 billion general election battle against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. I dont think its impossible, or beyond the realm of possibility, that at some point the Kochs are going to get involved, said Doug Deason, a member of the Koch network. Deason, who has met with Trump and his confidantes, said he and his father, the billionaire Darwin Deason, had proposed to Charles Koch in an email that he meet the Republican nominee in person. We think its really important that Donald convince Charles hes the right guy, and for Charles to influence Donalds policies, said Deason. Charles Koch indicates hes taking a wait and see approach. Hes not completely writing if off. An adviser to another major Koch network donor added: Some of the Koch donor class this weekend is surely going to say, Hey, guys, get on board. A spokesperson for Trump, who is scheduled to hold two campaign events in Colorado on Friday, did not respond to a request for comment. James Davis, a spokesman for the Kochs political operation, Freedom Partners Action Fund, declined comment. The billionaire donors eyeing Trump stress they believe it is urgent for the Koch brothers conservative thinking to start to influence Trump before the election while he is still fine-tuning policy and considering possible Cabinet picks. The Koch network, made up of the wealthiest conservative families in America, rivals both the Republican and Democratic parties in both its resources and scope. Membership requires a payment of at least $100,000 per year. But it is by no means a monolithic group.  At their donor summit last January in Palm Springs, California, most donors seemed vehemently opposed to Trump among the large field of other Republican options. But now that Trump has won the nomination, vanquishing 16 opponents in the primaries, some see little option but to back him. Broadcast magnate Stanley Hubbard, who had opposed Trump earlier in the year but now wants the Kochs to support him, said he was most concerned by the prospect of a Democrat nominating people to vacancies on the Supreme Court.  A lot of us are giving a lot of money to the Kochs, and what we would expect is that they would do all they can to see to it that the right Supreme Court justices are selected, Hubbard said. Supreme Court justices will last a lot longer than any president.  He said he hoped the weekend confab in Colorado would persuade the Kochs to rethink Trump.  If nothing else, the Kochs better ask for a show of hands, said Hubbard, and I think most people in the room this weekend will say, Yes, you need to get involved. ",politicsNews,"July 28, 2016 ",1
U.S. intelligence chief not ready to identify source of Democratic email hack,"ASPEN, Colo. (Reuters) - Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, speaking about the hack of Democratic Party emails, said on Thursday the U.S. intelligence community was not ready to make the call on attribution as to who was responsible. The White House said earlier the FBI had not disclosed any information about who was behind the hack. Cyber security experts and U.S. officials said on Monday there was evidence that Russia engineered the release of sensitive Democratic Party emails in order to influence the U.S. presidential election. The emails were released by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, and appeared to show that the Democratic National Committee favored Hillary Clinton over her chief rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders.  Clapper, speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, acknowledged that theres just a few usual suspects out there who might be responsible for the cyber intrusion, suggesting it was the work of a nation-state rather than an independent hacking group.  We dont know enough to ascribe motivation, he said. Was this just to stir up trouble, or was this ultimately to try to influence an election? Thats a serious proposition. Russian officials have dismissed the allegations of Moscows involvement. It is so absurd it borders on total stupidity, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. The Americans need to get to the bottom of what these emails are themselves and find out what its all about. Clapper said comments by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump questioning U.S. alliances in Europe and Asia had rattled foreign intelligence and security officials. While declining direct comment on Trumps remarks, he said:        Such statements, such rhetoric are very bothersome to our foreign interlocutors, our foreign partners. I hear that from counterparts, intelligence and security colleagues in many other countries.  It is a worry to them, it really is. ",politicsNews,"July 28, 2016 ",1
"Russia to U.S., Trump: Sort out your own pre-election hacking scandal","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia told the United States on Thursday to get to the bottom of a hacking scandal involving Democratic Party emails itself and rejected what Donald Trump said was a sarcastic suggestion that Moscow should dig up Hillary Clintons missing emails.   Trump, the Republican Partys presidential candidate, angered Democrats on Wednesday by inviting Russia to unearth tens of thousands of emails from rival Clintons tenure as U.S. secretary of state. He spoke out after President Barack Obama said it was possible Russia might try to influence the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election after a leak of Democratic National Committee emails that experts blamed on Russian hackers.  Suggestions of Russian involvement have riled the Kremlin, which has categorically denied this and accused U.S. politicians of seeking to play on Cold War-style American fears of Moscow by fabricating stories for electoral purposes. President Vladimir Putin has tried to avoid giving the impression of favoring any U.S. candidate, while hailing the populist Trump as being very talented. Russian state TV coverage has tended to tilt towards Trump over Clinton.    On Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said accusations of a Russian hand in hacking Democratic Party emails bordered on total stupidity and were motivated by anti-Russian sentiment. He rejected Trumps apparently sarcastic suggestion for Russia to dig up Clintons emails point-blank. As regards these (email) batches, that is not our headache. We never poke our noses into others affairs and we really dont like it when people try to poke their nose into ours, he said.  The Americans need to get to the bottom of what these emails are themselves and find out what its all about. Trump, who has repeatedly said he would strive for better U.S. relations with Russia if he won the presidency, also raised eyebrows by saying he would consider recognizing Ukraines Crimea as part of Russia, which annexed the region in 2014. Peskov said the Kremlin was unmoved by that comment, and it would not change what he says has been its neutral stance on U.S. presidential candidates. We know perfectly well that candidates in the heat of a pre-election struggle say one thing, but that later, when under the weight of responsibility, their rhetoric becomes more balanced. In response to Trumps remarks on Crimea, Ukraines U.N. Ambassador Volodymyr Yelchenko said on Thursday: Mr. Trump is not the president of the United States, at least not yet. Secondly, there are the well-known decisions of the United Nations. ... Im pretty sure that any U.S. government will pay full respect to those decisions, he told reporters.   In March 2014, the 193-member United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring invalid Crimeas Moscow-backed referendum seceding from Ukraine.  Analysts say the Kremlin would welcome a Trump victory in November because the wealthy New York businessman has repeatedly praised Putin, spoken of wanting to get along with Russia, and has said he would consider an alliance with Moscow against Islamic State. Trumps suggestion that he might abandon NATOs pledge to automatically defend all member states is also likely to have gone down well in Moscow, where the Western military alliance is cast as an outdated Cold War relic.

Dispatch from inside the conventions,"(Reuters) - Delegates at both the Republican and the Democratic conventions sported outrageous outfits - but the views from their respective gatherings were a study in contrast. Republican National Convention delegates in Cleveland last week embraced a freewheeling, policy-light lineup, reveling in messages of salvation from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps inner circle, while expressing their fears that America has become less safe.  A man wearing an orange jumpsuit and Hillary Clinton mask told Reuters he had been asked to take pictures standing next to hundreds of convention-goers, while lock her up - a cry to imprison Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton - became the crowds go-to chant.  A woman wearing a red cape with TRUMP spelled out in twinkle lights happily posed for the dozens of passersby requesting photos. The few remaining, weary Ted Cruz supporters found a rallying cry in the former Republican presidential candidates refusal to endorse Trump, a moment of party discord that prompted security to escort Heidi Cruz out of the convention hall and away from irate, yelling Trump supporters.  At this weeks Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, erstwhile candidate Bernie Sanders worked to build a bridge over troubled waters (yes, Paul Simon performed the song of that name). At the end of a roll call of state delegations, he called for Clinton to be nominated by voice vote - a show of support and a bid for unity after a bitter primary campaign. The move prompted deafening cheers on the convention floor - as well as a boos from Sanders supporters, who, on occasion, could be seen angrily arguing with Clinton backers. And there were celebrities - actresses Eva Longoria, Lena Dunham, America Ferrera, Sigourney Weaver and Elizabeth Banks drew shrieks and cheers from the crowd. But Clintons convention was heavy on policy and calls to public service.  Former President Bill Clinton received a rock stars welcome before ticking off a list of his wifes civic accomplishments. First lady Michelle Obama drove some members of a rapt audience to tears when she declared, I wake up in a house built by slaves. Reuters photographers caught up with several convention-goers, both Republican and Democrat, and asked If you could speak to your nominee, What would you like them to know about your hopes for the future of America? Here are some of their responses: Thank you for having my back, Sharon Jackson, a delegate from Alaska at the Republican convention, said, referring to Trump. Barbara Finger, a delegate from Wisconsin at the Republican conclave, also expressed gratitude to the New York businessman. Keep going the way you are, she said. Make America great again. Lavon Bracy, a Democratic delegate from Florida, expressed her support for Clinton at her partys convention, emphasizing the importance of unity. She said she hopes, We can all live together in harmony and understand that we have differences and appreciate those who are different. Democratic delegate Alvin Peters of Panama City, Florida, said he, too, hoped for brighter days. Spread the joy, said Peters. Dispel the doom and gloom.

Trump says was being 'sarcastic' in Russia hack comments,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday tried to quell the furor over his call for Russia to find Hillary Clintons deleted emails, saying he was being sarcastic. In Moscow, meanwhile, a Kremlin spokesman pointedly told Washington to solve its own email problems. Trump on Wednesday invited Russia to dig up tens of thousands of missing emails from Clintons time at the U.S. State Department, prompting Democrats to accuse him of urging foreigners to spy on Americans. Later, he dismissed concerns raised by Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook that his comments raised national security concerns. You have to be kidding. His client, his person, deleted 33,000 e-mails illegally. You look at that. And when Im being sarcastic with something ... Trump said in a Fox News interview broadcast on Thursday. Asked if he was indeed being sarcastic, Trump snapped, Of course Im being sarcastic. They dont even know, frankly, if its Russia. They have no idea if its Russia, if its China, if its somebody else. Who knows who it is? But you have 33,000 (Clinton) emails deleted, and the real problem is what was said on those emails from the Democratic National Committee, he said, referring to hacked emails released last weekend by WikiLeaks. The DNC emails showed party leaders favoring Clinton over her rival in the campaign for the nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The committee is supposed to be neutral. Trumps explanation echoed those of his campaign advisers and other supporters, who immediately tried to pass his comments off as tongue-in-cheek and not serious. But the exhortation for a U.S. adversary to use cyber intrusions against an American political candidate drew criticism from intelligence experts and other public figures, including some Republicans. Trump made the remark at a news conference in Miami that allowed him to steal some of the limelight from the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, where Clinton on Thursday will accept her partys presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election. Russia, if youre listening, I hope youre able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, told reporters. He later said on Twitter that if anyone had Clintons emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI! The Republican presidential nominee was referring to a private email system Clinton kept in her home in Chappaqua, New York, while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. She handed over thousands of emails in 2015 to U.S. officials probing that system, but did not release about 30,000 deleted emails she said were personal and not work-related. Cyber security experts and U.S. officials have said there was evidence that Russia engineered the release of the sensitive Democratic Party emails to influence the election. But the Kremlin beat back those insinuations again on Thursday, saying they were driven by anti-Russian sentiment. It is so absurd it borders on total stupidity, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. The Americans needs to get to the bottom of what these emails are themselves and find out what its all about. Although some Democrats have wondered aloud whether Trump committed a crime in his remarks directed at Russia, the prospect of any prosecution is considered nil because of the strong guarantee of speech rights in the United States. Charging Trump for his comments about Russia would turn campaign fluff into a crime and would be laughable, said Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor and former U.S.  prosecutor.

Hollande says will stay true to values after Trump swipe at France,"PARIS (Reuters) - President Francois Hollande on Thursday fired back at comments by U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump that France was no longer France after a slew of militant attacks, saying France would always stay true to its values. France is reeling from two strikes in under two weeks by attackers who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State, the first when a Tunisian plowed his truck through a crowd in Nice, the second when two men slit the throat of a priest. France is no longer France. They wont like me for saying that, Trump told reporters in Miami on Wednesday. And this world better be very careful and the better get very tough and theyll never do it with (Democratic nominee) Hillary Clinton. Trumps campaign has been marked by insults and inflammatory rhetoric. He has called for tougher surveillance of mosques and warned that radical Muslims were trying to take over our children. Trump has rejected the criticism that his rhetoric is racist. Brushing off Trumps words, Hollande on Thursday told reporters France would always remain true to its values and ideals. When you stoop low youre not true to yourself anymore, thats something that can happen to others on the other side of the Atlantic, Hollande said, without directly mentioning Trump.

Mistrust of Clinton on trade shadows her at Democratic convention,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When it comes to trade policy, Hillary Clinton is taking heat from all sides. At the Democratic National Convention this week, where Clinton will formally accept her partys presidential nomination, opposition to trade deals was plastered on buttons, scrawled on signs and chanted by delegates. Many are worried by her past support of 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is still awaiting congressional approval. Things are unlikely to get any easier for her. Clinton has said her stance on trade has evolved, that she now opposes TPP because it does not do enough to protect jobs and that she wants changes in NAFTA, the trade deal her husband, Bill Clinton, signed during his presidency. But that allows her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, to question her credibility, painting Clintons evolving position as a desperate attempt to catch up with his tough stance. Trump has vowed to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate NAFTA, labeling it a job killer. The real estate developer has also said he would pull the United States out of the 12-nation TPP. Even among the Democrats there are doubts about Clintons resolve, particularly among supporters of her former Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders, the U.S. Senator from Vermont whose opposition to trade deals featured prominently in his speeches during the Democratic primary season. The concern about trade was on display at the convention during a speech delivered on Wednesday night by Clintons running mate, Tim Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia who once supported TPP. Delegates waved anti-TPP placards as Kaine spoke, even though he changed his position after joining Clintons ticket. Larry Cohen, a senior adviser to Sanders, said trade was absolutely a danger for Clinton in the race against Trump, saying she had to show her commitment to opposing it and not just make pronouncements. The Trump campaign is smart enough that they will exploit this issue, Cohen said. Sanders supporters have said they intend to keep fighting TPP through the November election via a new group called Our Revolution that is dedicated to championing issues that Sanders pushed on the campaign trail. The frustration that a post-recession recovery has failed to translate into better wages and opportunities for million of working Americans has become one of the leading themes of the 2016 presidential campaign. A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken in March showed that 65 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of Republicans believed that trade cost some U.S. jobs even though many also agreed that trade helps to keep the costs of goods low. Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO labor federation, told Reuters that Clinton has told all of the major unions that endorsed her that she wanted to re-work NAFTA, echoing similar comments by Dennis Williams, president of the United Auto Workers union. Trumka said Clintons campaign has told him that she would take a whole new approach on trade and he said he was convinced that he could trust her on the issue. Shes not giving lip service to it. Shes committed to it, he said. Consulted about Clintons talks with unions regard NAFTA, a senior Mexican government official said the TPP already provided the United States with a platform to strengthen the rights of workers compared to NAFTA, although U.S. union activists say the new pact weakens rather than strengthens workers protection. They have the solution in their hands, if they back it, the official said, noting Congress had yet to ratify the TPP. The official added that it would be in Mexicos interests to strengthen the rules of origin in TPP that determine which country a product comes from, but sometimes allow foreign components in it. He cautioned, however, that re-opening trade deals was a highly complex undertaking. Morris Fiorina, a political science professor at Stanford University, said Clinton should try to address workers concerns but avoid a wholesale dismissal of free trade. Were I advising her Id suggest she try to thread the needle - explain that free trade has great benefits for the country as a whole, but past and pending agreements do not adequately recognize and compensate the losers.She will remedy that failure, Fiorina said. However, such nuanced approach may prove self-defeating in the light of Trumps challenge and internal dissent. Robin Biro, a field director for the Democratic Party in Atlanta and a Clinton supporter, said TPP was a make or break issue for Clinton to attract Democrats who voted for Sanders in the primary. Shes only going to get the support of the Bernie people if she comes out strongly on that issue, Biro said. ",politicsNews,"July 28, 2016 ",1
U.S. theory on Democratic Party breach: Hackers meant to leave Russia's mark,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some U.S. intelligence officials suspect that Russian hackers who broke into Democratic Party computers may have deliberately left digital fingerprints to show Moscow is a cyberpower that Washington should respect.  Three officials, all speaking on condition of anonymity, said the breaches of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) were less sophisticated than other cyber intrusions that have been traced to Russian intelligence agencies or criminals. For example, said one official, the hackers used some Cyrillic characters, worked during Russian government business hours but not on Russian religious or political holidays.Either these guys were incredibly sloppy, in which case its not clear that they could have gotten as far as they did without being detected, or they wanted us to know they were Russian, said the official. Private sector cyber security experts agreed that the evidence clearly points to Russian hackers but dismissed the idea that they intentionally left evidence of their identities. These experts - who said they have examined the breach in detail - said the Cyrillic characters were buried in metadata and in an error message. Other giveaways, such as a tainted Internet protocol address, also were difficult to find. Russian hacking campaigns have traditionally been harder to track than Chinas but not impossible to decipher, private sector experts said. But the Russians have become more aggressive and easier to detect in the past two years, security experts said, especially when they are trying to move quickly. False flags have grown more common, but the government and private experts do not believe that is involved in the DNC case. The two groups of hackers involved are adept at concealing their intrusions, said Laura Galante, head of global threat intelligence at FireEye, whose Mandiant subsidiary conducted forensic analysis of the attack and corroborated the findings of another cyber company, CrowdStrike. Russian officials have dismissed the allegations of Moscows involvement as absurd. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in his only response to reporters, said: I dont want to use four-letter words.  While private cyber experts and the government were aware of the political partys hacking months ago, embarrassing emails were leaked last weekend by the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy group just as the Democratic Party prepared to anoint Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate for the Nov. 8 election. DNC chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, resigned after the leaked emails showed party leaders favoring Clinton over her rival in the campaign for the nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The committee is supposed to be neutral. The U.S. intelligence officials conceded that they had  based their views on deductive reasoning and not conclusive evidence, but suggested Russias aim probably was much broader than simply undermining Clintons campaign. They said the hack fit a pattern of Russian President Vladimir Putin pushing back on what he sees as the United States and its European allies trying to weaken Russia. Call it the cyber equivalent of buzzing NATO ships and planes using fighters with Russian flags on their tails, said one official. Two sources familiar with Democratic Party investigations into the hacking said the private email accounts of Democratic Party officials were targeted as well as servers.  They said that the FBI had advised the DNC that it was looking into the hacking of the individual officials private accounts. They also said the FBI also requested additional information identifying the personal email accounts of certain party officials. The DNC hired CrowdStrike to investigate the hack. It spent  about six weeks, from late April to about June 11 or 12,  monitoring the systems and watching while the hackers - who they believed were Russian - operated inside the systems, one of the sources said. What actions, if any, the Obama administration will take are unclear and could depend on what diplomatic considerations may ultimately be involved, a former White House cyber security official said. In past cases, administration officials have decided to publicly blame North Korea and indict members of Chinas military for hacking because the administration decided that the net benefit of public shaming  and increased awareness brought to cyber security  outweighed potential risks, the former official said. But the Russia calculation is far more difficult and precarious, the former official said. Russia is a much more aggressive, capable foreign actor both in the traditional military sense and in the cyber realm and that made public attribution or covert retaliation much less likely. The former official, and a source familiar with the Democratic Party investigations, said that they also were unaware of any U.S. intelligence clearly demonstrating that WikiLeaks had received the hacked materials directly from Russians or that WikiLeaks release of the materials was in any way directed by Russians.

WikiLeaks releases hacked Democratic National Committee audio files,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - WikiLeaks released files on Wednesday of what it said were audio recordings pulled from the emails of the Democratic National Committee that were obtained by hacking its servers.  The latest release, which came in the middle of the Democratic National Convention where Hillary Clinton was officially named the partys presidential nominee, is the second batch in a series that has deeply rattled the party and prompted the organizations chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, to step down.

"In clash of billionaires, Bloomberg calls Trump White House race 'a con'","PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - New York media mogul Michael Bloomberg assailed fellow billionaire Donald Trump on Wednesday, calling his U.S. presidential race a con and ripping into his history of bankruptcies and lawsuits. Trump says he wants to run the nation like hes running his business? God help us, Bloomberg told the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia to roaring applause. Im a New Yorker and I know a con when I see one. Formerly a Republican and now an independent, Bloomberg was for the most part greeted warmly by the audience in the Wells Fargo Center arena where he threw his support behind the Democrats presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. The owner of the Bloomberg media empire and a former New York City mayor, Bloomberg was an odd choice for a speaker at the Democratic conclave, where many party progressives have railed against the influence of billionaires in politics. Let me thank all of you for welcoming an outsider here, to deliver what will be an unconventional convention speech, he said when he took the stage, eliciting cheers. I am not here as a member of any party. I am here for one reason: to explain why I believe it is imperative that we elect Hillary Clinton as the next president of the United States. Bloomberg had considered running for the White House as an independent this year but dropped the idea in March, saying it could increase the chances Trump would win. Bloomberg has known Trump casually for years and twice appeared on Trumps reality TV show The Apprentice.  But since Trump entered the race for president in June 2015, Bloomberg has taken issue with him, lashing out at his policies and fiery rhetoric, especially his call to ban Muslims from entering the country and his promise to wall off the Mexican border and deport millions of undocumented foreigners. On Wednesday, he went a step further and favorably compared his own business record to Trumps. Ive built a business, and I didnt start it with a million-dollar check from my father, Bloomberg said. Forbes lists Bloomberg, 74, as Americas sixth wealthiest American, with a fortune amounting to $47.7 billion.  Trump, 70, who often boasts about his extravagant wealth and success in the real estate business, is listed 113th with $4.5 billion, though that figure has been widely challenged. A Reuters review of Trumps federal filings showed he had cash and other liquid investments worth between $60 million and $180 million in May, far short of the amount he would need to self-fund his campaign.

Trump draws ire after urging Russia to find 'missing' Clinton emails,"MIAMI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump on Wednesday invited Russia to dig up tens of thousands of missing emails from Hillary Clintons time at the U.S. State Department, vexing intelligence experts and prompting Democrats to accuse him of urging foreigners to spy on Americans. Russia, if youre listening, I hope youre able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, told reporters. Trump made the remark at a testy news conference at his Doral golf resort in Florida that allowed him to steal some of the limelight from the Philadelphia convention where Clinton on Thursday will accept the Democratic presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election. The Clinton campaign shot back that Trump was posing a possible national security threat by encouraging a foreign power to conduct espionage in the United States. Some intelligence experts said the comments raised questions about Trumps judgment. A spokesman for Trump, Jason Miller, tried to tamp down the storm of protest, saying Trump did not urge Russia to hack Clintons emails. Trump said on Twitter that if anyone had Clintons emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI! The criticism of Trumps comments reverberated at the Democratic National Convention where speakers brought up the episode to try to intensify Democratic support for Clinton, who is running neck and neck with Trump in the polls. Donald Trump today once again took Russias side. He asked the Russians to interfere in American politics, longtime Clinton supporter and former CIA Director Leon Panetta said. Donald Trump ... is asking one of our adversaries to engage in hacking or intelligence efforts against the United States of America to affect the election. Another speaker, retired U.S. Rear Admiral John Hutson, said of Trump: This morning, he personally invited Russia to hack us. Thats not law and order, thats criminal intent. Trump was referring in his remarks to a private email system Clinton kept while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. She handed over thousands of emails in 2015 to U.S. officials probing that system, but did not release about 30,000 emails she said were personal and not work-related. A Federal Bureau of Investigation probe of the issue found no basis for criminal charges, but FBI Director James Comey said this month there was evidence Clinton was extremely careless in her handling of classified information. Trump dismissed suggestions that WikiLeaks release of embarrassing Democratic Party emails last week was engineered by Russia to help nudge the U.S. election toward Trump, who has been called very talented by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Its just a total deflection, this whole thing with Russia, said Trump. I never met Putin. I dont know who Putin is.  The Democratic Party chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, resigned on Sunday after the leaked emails showed party leaders favoring Clinton over her rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, for the presidential nomination. Cyber security experts and U.S. officials have said there was evidence that Russia engineered the release of the sensitive party emails in order to influence the presidential election. Throughout a day of campaigning, Trump suggested the culprit could be China or even, as he said in Scranton, Pennsylvania, a 400-pound person lying in bed. FOUR-LETTER WORDS Russia has brushed aside suggestions it was involved. I dont want to use four-letter words, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters on Tuesday. Trump has alarmed European allies and many U.S. national security experts with talk of forcing NATO nations to pay more for the U.S. security umbrella. By the way, if they dont pay, bye bye, he said in Toledo, Ohio, on Wednesday night. He has praised Putin in the past and said this week that if elected, he would seek an alliance with Moscow to take on Islamic State militants. But he sought to distance himself from Putin at his news conference, saying his closest interaction with Russia was selling a Florida home to a Russian for more than he paid for it. A U.S. State Department spokesman declined to comment on Trumps remarks on Wednesday. Trumps vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, took a different approach from the Republican nominee, saying he expected the FBI to get to the bottom of the matter. If it is Russia, and they are interfering in our elections, I can assure you both parties and the United States government will ensure there are serious consequences, Pence said in a statement. During the news conference, which lasted more than an hour, Trump also called Barack Obama, a Democrat, the most ignorant president ever and said Vice President Joe Biden was not bright. Asked if he would recognize Crimea as Russian territory, Trump said he would be looking into that. Crimea has long been part of Ukraine, but Russia annexed it in 2014 after pro-Russian separatists and special forces took over the region. The U.S. government considers it still part of Ukraine.

Activist Steyer expands agenda in bid to defeat 'dangerous' Trump,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer is expanding his political agenda beyond climate change to embrace issues ranging from immigration to income inequality, which he expects will be critical to mustering votes for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the November presidential election. Steyer, who four years ago left the hedge fund firm he co-founded in order to devote himself full-time to environmental activism, said he hoped the broader agenda for his NextGen Climate organization would help undermine Republican nominee Donald Trump. He derided the New York real estate magnates policies as dangerous and delusional.  Steyer has directed NextGen, his main advocacy arm, to delve into immigration, racial justice, wealth inequality and education instead of just environmentalism to better drive youth and minority voter turnout for the Nov. 8 election. Were talking about a broader group of connected issues,  and we dont think any of them stand without the others, Steyer told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, explaining the shift. NextGen has already produced ads in California attacking Trump on immigration and his temperament. In one, a group of young people are filmed listening to Trump describe Mexicans as rapists and drug dealers and promising to wall off the border. In another, women look into the camera as Trumps voice is heard calling women fat, disgusting, and ugly. Steyer said he hoped the broader agenda for NextGen would help undermine Trump. I show him no respect, Steyer said. A Trump spokesperson was not immediately available to comment. NextGens shift into new issues began a few months ago, Steyer said, and was inspired by his work on Californias progressive Fair Shake commission, launched last year by a group of high-profile activists, academics and former politicians focused on wealth inequality in the state.  That was the genesis to some extent. It allowed us to look deeply at all the related issues, he said.  NextGen has spent about $20 million so far on the U.S. election, and is likely to spend at least another $55 million by election day.  Steyer, who has earned a reputation as Americas most influential environmental advocate, has had mixed results in his crusade on climate change, despite the money he has poured into mobilizing voters around the issue. Steyer has battled large-scale oil industry infrastructure projects like the Keystone XL pipeline, which was rejected by the administration of President Barack Obama last year, and has sought to bolster climate-friendly politicians. In 2014, NextGen pumped around $75 million into efforts to support six climate-friendly Democratic candidates in mid-term elections, but only two of whom won their contests. In the current presidential contest, NextGen has fallen short of its aim make climate change a critical issue, eclipsed by voter rage over issues including immigration, the economy and national security.  Reuters/Ipsos polling shows only about 25 percent of likely American voters will make a choice on the basis of a candidates views on climate change, although most agree that the United States should act to combat it. Steyer endorsed Clinton last month after she clinched the Democratic nomination following a heated battle against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Clinton has said she would seek to advance renewable energy use, boost regulation and reduce U.S. consumption of oil and coal if elected.  I can take them at their word that they are going to prioritize this, Steyer said. Trump has called climate change a hoax and has vowed to cut U.S. environmental regulation to expand U.S. drilling and coal mining, part of his bid to win over blue collar voters. Steyer called that position dangerous.  It would be funny if it werent so serious, he said. ",politicsNews,"July 27, 2016 ",1
Senior U.S. lawmakers want information on DNC hack declassified,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Democrats on the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives intelligence committees called on Wednesday for the White House to consider declassifying and releasing any intelligence community assessments of the hack into the Democratic National Committee email system. Experts have attributed the breach to Russian hackers. Given the grave nature of this breach and the fact that it may ultimately be found to be a state-sponsored attempt to manipulate our presidential election, we believe a heightened measure of transparency is warranted, Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Adam Schiff wrote in a letter to President Barack Obama. Obama said in an interview broadcast by NBC News on Tuesday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating the leak of more than 19,000 DNC emails, which showed the committee had favored Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders for the partys presidential nomination.

"WTO chief won't debate Trump, but rallies support for trade","GENEVA (Reuters) - The head of the World Trade Organization said on Wednesday he would not get into an argument with U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has described the global trade body as a disaster and threatened to quit it. But WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo told a news conference he thought the arguments in favor of global trade needed to be put more forcefully. He said he had warned before Britains referendum last month of the risks of leaving the European Union, saying it would require years of complex trade talks to complete, but sometimes people dont want to hear the arguments.  Appearing on NBCs Meet the Press on July 24, Trump said U.S. companies that move production to Mexico should be taxed and shrugged off suggestions this would break WTO rules. Were going to renegotiate or were going to pull out, he said. We think trade is so obviously positive for every economy that its like trying to argue with a friend that he needs to breathe, Azevedo said, adding: I dont think we do enough in making the case for trade. Azevedo, who said earlier on Wednesday that he would seek a second four-year term as the head of the WTO, said he was impressed by the number of people who had responded to Trump by speaking up for trade, sometimes from unexpected quarters. He declined to comment on what would happen if the United States did withdraw from the 21-year-old trading club, which now boasts 163 members and governs the vast majority of global commerce through a system of mutually agreed rules. Under President Barack Obama, the WTO has been an important arena for the United States to defend its commercial interests against China, India and other major trading powers.  A debate over trade also raged before Britains June 23 referendum on leaving the European Union. Britain voted in favor of Brexit despite warnings from Azevedo and others about the risks, and the country now faces years of protracted and complex trade talks to try to extricate itself from the EU. Asked how to improve the quality of debate and help voters understand the issues, Azevedo said people sometimes make decisions on a basis of things that is completely foreign to the rationale of the issue that you are discussing. It has nothing to do with how trade helps or does not help. ",politicsNews,"July 27, 2016 ",1

If it is Russia and they are interfering in our elections, I can assure you both parties and the United States government will ensure there are serious consequences, the Indiana governor and Donald Trumps running mate said in a statement.

"No plans to release tax returns as pressure mounts, Trump aide says","(Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump will not be releasing his tax returns due to a federal audit, his campaign manager said on Wednesday, despite pressure to release them and provide a window into his finances before the Nov. 8 election. Mr. Trump has said that his taxes are under audit, and he will not be releasing them, campaign manager Paul Manafort said in an interview with CBS on Wednesday. That issue will be dealt with when the audits are done. His Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has released tax returns and called on Trump to put out his. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, has called it disqualifying for a partys White House nominee not to make tax returns public.  Trump has come under new pressure to release financial information and show whether he has any ties to Russia. That came after U.S. officials this week said there was evidence that Russia was involved in the recent release of sensitive Democratic Party emails, potentially to influence the U.S. election. Trump has often praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a strong leader, but on Tuesday he said it was crazy for Democrats to suggest Russia would try to help his election bid. For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia, Trump wrote on Twitter. Manafort said on CBS on Wednesday that Trumps hesitance to release his tax returns has nothing to do with Russia. Asked to clarify that Trump has no financial relationships with any Russian oligarchs, Manafort responded, Thats what he said. ... Thats obviously what our position is.

Make Hillary Likable Again: Democrats seek to recast Clinton,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - When Hillary Clinton first ran for president in 2008 she was badly stung by a backhanded compliment from rival Barack Obama, who called her likable enough before going on to win the Democratic nomination and the White House. Eight years later, with her partys nomination to succeed Obama firmly in hand, the question of her likability, trustworthiness and honesty still hangs over her bid to become Americas first woman president, this time in a Nov. 8 election against Republican Donald Trump. The Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia this week is, in part, an effort to reintroduce her to American voters, more than half of whom view her unfavorably, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. The criticisms have dogged her for years: She can appear stiff in front of crowds, struggling to show off the compassion her supporters say she shares in private and leaving some voters with the impression she is not giving straight answers to tough questions. Clinton recognizes the problem, aides say. She knows that she has work to do to earn peoples trust, said Jennifer Palmieri, Clintons communications director. She also realizes there arent some magic words you can say to earn that trust overnight. Speaker after speaker at the convention took the stage on Monday and Tuesday to offer testimonials on her behalf, including her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who filled his prime-time speech on Tuesday with anecdotes and private moments shared by Americas best-known political couple. Gay basketball player Jason Collins told of the support she offered when he went public with his homosexuality; a grandmother described how her daughters battle with drug addiction inspired Clinton to address the drug crisis. A parade of others offered behind-the-scenes glimpses of the former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state, describing how she drove through a blizzard to attend a funeral, planned birthday parties and visited survivors of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.  Clintons personal image, which has fluctuated during her 25 years in the public eye, slumped after a divisive Democratic primary, a lingering controversy over her use of a private email system while serving as the top U.S. diplomat, and repeated Republican attacks on crooked Hillary. Reuters/Ipsos polling showed 55 percent of Americans had an unfavorable view of Clinton. Trump is even less popular, with 61 percent holding an unfavorable view. Many Americans think both candidates struggle with the truth. Some 59 percent of Americans believe she is not honest and truthful, while 53 percent think the same of Trump, according to the poll. Republican strategist John Feehery said it was too late to rehabilitate Clintons image. You only get one decade to make a first impression, he said.  Instead, a  better strategy would be to focus on tearing down Trump, given that his negatives surpass her own, Feehery added. Clintons campaign appears to be trying just that, running an ad in which Trump can be seen in newsclips, as children watch, swearing, condemning Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers, and mocking a disabled journalist. Clinton, 68, has been a lightning rod for conservative attacks for more than two decades and Republicans serenaded speakers at their convention in Cleveland last week with chants of Lock Her Up and signs touting Hillary for Prison.  For many Democrats who back Clinton, the poor polling numbers are the result of those relentless attacks - along with a strong dose of sexism toward a woman seeking power. If you have somebody who is out there pounding you and pounding you and pounding you, eventually its going to take a toll, Richard Trumka, head of the AFL-CIO labor federation, said. Ive said this and Ive said it publicly: Hillary Clinton has to do A+ work to get a C-. For Democrats, this week affords perhaps their best chance before the election to fortify her against inevitable attacks by Trump that could further dent her image. Praise came from invitees ranging from party superstars (First Lady Michelle Obama) to unknowns (former White House interns).    In one video broadcast to delegates, Clinton embraces and comforts an 11-year-old girl who fears her parents will be deported. In another, shown before the appearance of the Mothers of the Movement - mothers who lost children to gun violence or in police-involved incidents - she encourages them in a private meeting to band together and speak out. A 30-minute meeting turned into two hours because she listened to us. Nobody else listened to us, said Sybrina Fulton, mother of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old whose fatal shooting death by a neighborhood watch volunteer in 2012 launched a series of protests around the country. Actress Eva Longoria said it was time for Democrats to rally to Clintons defense. Shes had a 25-year smear campaign run against her. Its understandable Americans are confused about what is true and what is not, she told a womens delegate caucus on Tuesday. ",politicsNews,"July 27, 2016 ",1
Kremlin says allegations it hacked U.S. Democratic Party 'made-up horror stories',"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin on Wednesday dismissed allegations Russia had hacked Democratic Party emails as horror stories dreamt up by U.S. politicians, saying it never interfered in other countries election campaigns. Moscow is at pains to avoid any words that could be interpreted as direct or indirect interference in the election process, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters. ... We see that the Russian card is in the red corner on the writing table of all Washington politicians during the election campaign, and that very often they make it a trump card in their game. Peskov was responding after U.S. President Barack Obama in an interview with NBC News said it was possible Russia would try to influence the U.S. presidential election after a leak of Democratic National Committee emails that experts have blamed on Russian hackers. This reminds me of a company where they tell each other horror stories and then start being frightened of their own stories, said Peskov. The Kremlin on Tuesday said unidentified individuals in the United States were trying to cynically exploit fear of Russia for electoral purposes.      ",politicsNews,"July 27, 2016 ",1
Bill Clinton portrays Hillary as 'change-maker' in speech to Democrats,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Former President Bill Clinton portrayed his wife Hillary on Tuesday as a dynamic force for change and a longtime fighter for social justice as he made a case for her historic 2016 bid for the White House.      The ex-president told the Democratic Party convention in Philadelphia that Hillary Clinton was a natural leader with an in-built sense of responsibility. Hillary is uniquely qualified to seize the opportunities and reduce the risks we face, and she is still the best darn change-maker I have ever known, he said. Earlier in the day, Hillary Clinton secured the Democratic Partys nomination for the Nov. 8 election, coming back from a stinging 2008 defeat in her first White House run and surviving a bitter primary fight to become the first woman to head the ticket of a major party in U.S. history. Bill Clinton told the convention in a keynote speech that Hillary had been an activist for social justice since the couples early days as law students together. He told how she gave legal aid services to poor people and went undercover to expose a segregationist school in Alabama in the 1970s.   After a tough battle with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders during the state-by-state nominating contests, Clinton is now the partys standard-bearer against Republican nominee Donald Trump.  Bill Clinton said Republicans led by Trump had made Hillary out to be a cartoon but the real thing was nothing like the their portrayal of her.      Theyre running against a cartoon. Cartoons are two-dimensional, theyre easy to absorb. Life in the real world is complicated and real change is hard, and a lot of people even think its boring, he said. Then speaking directly to the crowd, he said to cheers and applause: Good for you because earlier today you nominated the real one.     President from 1993 to 2001, Bill Clinton, 69, left office with high approval ratings and is known as one of the most powerful political orators in the country. His speech offered an unusual twist to the warm spousal endorsement of a presidential candidate traditionally given in party conventions by a wife, not a man - let alone a former president of the United States. Hillary Clintons nomination was a milestone in Americas 240-year-old history. U.S. women got the right to vote in 1920 after ratification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.  Supporters of Hillary Clinton say her Washington credentials show she has the experience needed for the White House during troubled times as the United States tries to speed up its economic recovery and faces security challenges abroad. Detractors view her as too cozy with the establishment and say she carries political baggage dating back to the start of Bill Clintons first White House term in the 1990s.

"Trump, Pence master delicate art of dancing together on campaign trail","MIAMI (Reuters) - Donald Trump was in the middle of creating another nickname for Democratic rival Hillary Clinton - Hillary Rotten Clinton! - when he suddenly thought of his mild-mannered vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence. You think Mike Pence would say this? he smiled to the audience in Roanoke, Virginia. What a high-quality person. On their first campaign swing together this week, Trump and Pence are giving voters an initial look at their odd-couple pairing as they prepare to battle against Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, the Virginia governor, in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Their public routine is a work in progress, but its clear that theyve learned from their first joint appearance, a sometimes awkward interview on CBSs 60 Minutes. In that session, Trump frequently talked over Pence and Pence went out of his way to wave off his differences with Trump on policies like his past support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump wants to renegotiate. They now have a system: When they campaign together, Pence introduces Trump enthusiastically as the modern-day equivalent of 1980s Republican President Ronald Reagan and speaks of himself as the son of a combat veteran and the father of a U.S. Marine. Then he steps aside. The Trump-Pence union was a political marriage of necessity. The combustible, free-wheeling Trump needed the staid, staunchly conservative Pence, the governor of Indiana, to give him some credibility with establishment Republicans and a boost in the Midwest. The risks for Pence seem minimal and the upsides are huge. He opted out of the 2016 Republican presidential sweepstakes in the fallout over his fight over a religious freedom law in Indiana that critics said was anti-gay, and he faced a potentially difficult re-election race for governor. With his experience as a former member of Congress, he could serve as a conduit to lawmakers in a Trump administration, something that could be important for a presidential candidate who has never held elective office. In the two weeks since he was named Trumps running mate, Pence has become a lightning rod for criticism from Democrats who portray him as holding extreme right-wing views. Clintons campaign chairman, John Podesta, described Pence as an incredibly divisive and unpopular running mate known for supporting discriminatory politics and failed economic policies that favor millionaires and corporations over working families. Pence seems to be still getting accustomed to Trumps worldview. While introducing Trump in Roanoke on Monday, he hewed closely to the establishment Republican position in criticizing Clinton for not doing more to ensure that a contingent of U.S. troops was left in Iraq after a U.S.-Iraqi agreement expired. Remember, it was Hillary Clinton who squandered the gains that were made at the close of our presence in Iraq, the failure in judgment that sent ISIS on the loose, Pence said in Roanoke, using an acronym for the Islamic State militant group. That was at odds with Trumps view that the American invasion of Iraq was wrong. I didnt want to go to Iraq, Trump said moments after Pence spoke. Still, Pences loyalty to Trump seems absolute.  In his speech introducing Trump at their appearance before the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Tuesday, Pence tried to show what Trump is like behind all the bluster. I know this mans heart, Pence said. I know the way he speaks, when the cameras are off. Trump chose Pence over former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, the two other finalists. Although Republican elites have been divided over Trumps presidential bid, many approve his choice in a No. 2. Mike Pence is a good man. He will add value to the ticket, tweeted Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor and one of Trumps former rivals for the nomination. Gingrich said via email that Pence is proving to be a good balance for Trumps powerful personality.  Trump himself jokingly brought up the vetting process that led him to Pence, describing a candidate who was squeaky clean compared to others whose background checks turned up many pages of materials. With Mike, they came back with like nothing. Hes the most perfect human being, this guy. I love him. Where is he? I love him, Trump said. ",politicsNews,"July 26, 2016 ",1
Obama says it is possible Russia would try to sway U.S. election,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said it was possible that Russia  would try to influence the U.S. presidential election, after a leak of Democratic National Committee emails that experts have attributed to Russian hackers. Anything is possible, Obama told NBC News in an interview broadcast on Tuesday when asked if the Russians would try to influence the Nov. 8 election. Obama said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating the leak on Friday of more than 19,000 DNC emails, which showed the committee had favored Hillary Clinton over  Senator Bernie Sanders for the partys presidential nomination. I know that experts have attributed this to the Russians, Obama said. What we do know is that the Russians hack our systems, not just government systems but private systems, he said. The email leak forced Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida to resign as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. Clinton, who received the Democratic nomination on Tuesday at the partys convention in Philadelphia, will face Republican Donald Trump in the election. What the motives were in terms of the leaks, all that, I cant say directly. What I do know is that Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin, Obama  said. Trump has often praised Putin, calling him a strong leader. The New York businessman also told the New York Times last week that with him in the White House, NATO might not automatically defend the Baltic states that were once part of the Russian-led Soviet Union. I think that Trump has gotten pretty favorable coverage back in Russia, Obama said. ",politicsNews,"July 26, 2016 ",1
UAW chief says Clinton told him she would renegotiate NAFTA,"(Reuters) - United Auto Workers President Dennis Williams said on Tuesday that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has assured him she would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement if she is elected president. Williams comments come as Clinton is under pressure on international trade deals from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and supporters of her former Democratic rival Bernie Sanders. Clinton has previously said she wanted to rework NAFTA. Her campaign on Tuesday declined to comment on the meeting with Williams. Williams said he met with Clinton one-on-one prior to the unions endorsement of her in May, when Sanders was still in the race to be the Democratic partys nominee. The UAW has more than 400,000 members.  Shes committed to me that not only would (she) dig into NAFTA but she made every indication that she would sit down and try to redo NAFTA, Williams told reporters during a telephone press conference from Philadelphia, where he is attending the Democratic National Convention. Williams said Clinton recognizes that NAFTA was not the success that it was supposed to be, when her husband, Bill Clinton, pushed for it as president two decades ago. Stephen Miller, senior policy adviser to the Trump campaign, said Hillary Clinton will never renegotiate Bill Clintons NAFTA. The Trump campaign adviser said, You can be certain when she was personally getting paid millions and millions by Wall Street and big banks to deliver secret speeches she wasnt breathing a word against globalist trade pacts.  NAFTA, which eliminated most tariffs on trade between the United States, Mexico and Canada, was promoted as a way to support economic growth by eliminating barriers to trade. Opponents say it has robbed Americans of jobs because it makes it easy for U.S. companies to move operations to Mexico where wages are much lower.   Williams said he hopes that an updated treaty would help foster stronger worker unions in Mexico, where many auto manufacturers have factories. She told us all that, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in an interview, referring to Clintons assurances to labor unions that she would rework NAFTA. The AFL-CIO, a federation of unions which includes the UAW,  stayed neutral during the Democratic primary but endorsed Clinton in June once it was clear she would become the partys nominee. The UAW endorsed Clinton in May. Williams said that support among UAW members for a Trump presidency has fallen to about 19 percent from 28 percent last year, before Trump said that new automotive industry jobs could be placed in states without strong union support at lower wages than those earned by UAW members.

Democrats beat Republicans in first night TV convention audience,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrats beat Republicans in U.S. television ratings, according to Nielsen data released on Tuesday for the first night of the Democratic National Convention. An estimated 26 million people watched Monday evening  between 10 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. Eastern time, when first lady Michelle Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders were among the key speakers, Nielsen said. The data represents people watching across seven broadcast and cable TV networks.  The total is about three million more TV eyes than for the first night of the Republican convention last week when White House contender Donald Trumps wife Melania was the keynote speaker. All in all, some 23 million Americans watched the first night of the Republican convention last week - in line with the audience for the 2012 gathering. Trumps big acceptance speech on Thursday night last week, however, failed to deliver the record audiences many TV executives had been expecting. In 2012, the Democratic convention generally drew more nightly TV viewers than the Republican gathering, when Mitt Romney was running for the White House. ",politicsNews,"July 26, 2016 ",1
U.S. expands Central American refugee screening program,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration announced a broad expansion on Tuesday of a program to let people fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras enter the United States as refugees, and said Costa Rica agreed to temporarily shelter some of those with no other recourse. Under the plan, Costa Rica will host up to 200 applicants at a time deemed too vulnerable to remain in their homelands while the U.S. Department of Homeland Security evaluates them for possible resettlement, which could take up to six months. The United States will also expand a program for child refugees and allow some people to apply for refugee status in their home countries. The steps, after months of criticism of President Barack Obamas handling of the crisis, are modest in comparison to plans announced by Secretary of State John Kerry in January to open several refugee processing centers in the region. Our current efforts to date have been insufficient to address the number of people who may have legitimate refugee claims, Amy Pope, deputy homeland security adviser at Obamas National Security Council, told a telephone briefing for reporters. Many details, including how the program would be financed or how many people might be eligible, were unavailable. Advocates said they were pleased the administration was  moving to provide the migrants, especially children, with an alternative to staying home with their lives at risk or relying on smugglers for the dangerous journey through Mexico. Its really the way the program should have been established from the start, but even belatedly were happy to see that this is the direction that theyre taking it, said Bill Frelick, director of the refugee rights program at Human Rights Watch. Since October, nearly 80,000 children and families from the three countries have been apprehended at the U.S. border with Mexico. The crisis has fueled heated debate on the campaign trail over whether to welcome migrants fleeing violence or build a wall to keep them out, a centerpiece of Republican Donald Trumps run for president. Republican Representative Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, called the plan an abuse of the law. Todays expansion of the Obama Administrations policy is simply a continuation of the government-sanctioned border surge, he said in a statement. The program also met resistance in the region. Guatemalan government officials rejected the description of those seeking to leave the country as refugees. The administration also will expand its Central American Minors program, which allows those under 21 with a parent in the United States legally to seek refugee status. The program will now allow siblings, care givers or another parent to do so. Only 267 minors have entered the United States since the program began in December 2014. Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said 2,880 applicants have been approved and are awaiting resettlement. The New York Times reported in January that the United States planned to admit up to 9,000 Central American refugees. Costa Rican Minister of the Presidency Sergio Alfaro told a news conference in San Jose the government reserved the explicit right to ask for more information if there were doubts about those granted the six-month humanitarian visas. Carlos Maldonado of the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) said the UNHCR and International Organization for Migration would handle costs incurred as applicants were processed in Costa Rica. If approved, they would most likely head to the United States, but could go to Canada, Sweden, Argentina, Brazil, Chile or Uruguay. Convincing countries to host a center has been difficult amid concern slow processing would lead to a backlog of people with nowhere to go, U.S. sources said. Nearly 8,000 Cubans migrating to the United States were stuck in Costa Rica recently when neighboring Nicaragua closed its border. Costa Ricas location is also a challenge. Salvadorans, Hondurans and Guatemalans seeking to move to the United States must travel south, across Nicaragua, to get there. ",politicsNews,"July 26, 2016 ",1
Kremlin says idea it hacked U.S. Democratic Party emails absurd,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin dismissed as absurd on Tuesday allegations it was behind the hacking of U.S. Democratic Party emails, saying unidentified individuals were trying to cynically exploit fear of Russia for electoral purposes. It responded after cyber security experts and U.S. officials said there was evidence Russia had engineered the release of sensitive Democratic Party emails in order to influence the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. The emails, released by activist group WikiLeaks at the weekend, appeared to show favouritism within the Democratic National Committee (DNC) for Hillary Clinton and prompted the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. President Vladimir Putin has tried to avoid giving the impression he favours any U.S. candidate, but has hailed Republican Party nominee Donald Trump as being very talented. Russian state TV, which hews closely to the Kremlins world view, has left little doubt however that Moscow would prefer Trump. It casts Clinton, whom Putin accused of stirring up protests against him in her role as U.S. Secretary of State in 2011, as a warmonger. We are again seeing these maniacal attempts to exploit the Russian theme in the U.S. election campaign, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked about the leaked emails.  This is not breaking new ground, this is an old trick which is being played again. This is not good for our bilateral relations, but we understand that we simply have to get through this unpleasant period. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said earlier on Tuesday he had raised the hacking issue at a meeting in Laos with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.  I dont want to use four-letter words, was Lavrovs only  response to reporters when asked whether Russia was responsible for the email hack. Earlier this month, Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser to Trump, visited Moscow, where he gave a lecture complaining that Western governments had often had a hypocritical focus on democratisation in the post-Soviet world. Analysts say the Kremlin would welcome a Trump win because the billionaire U.S. businessman has repeatedly praised Putin, spoken of wanting to get along with Russia, and has said he would consider an alliance with Moscow against Islamic State.  Trumps suggestion he might abandon NATOs pledge to automatically defend all alliance members is also likely to have gone down well in Moscow, where the military alliance is cast as an outdated Cold War relic.

Trump edges ahead of Clinton in U.S. presidential race: Reuters/Ipsos poll," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump posted a two-point lead over his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday, the first time he has been ahead since early May.  Trumps gains came as he accepted his partys nomination to the Nov. 8 ballot at the four-day Republican National Convention in Cleveland last week, and as Clintons nomination in Philadelphia this week was marred by party divisions and the resignation of a top party official.  MORE FROM REUTERS:  Musk sees 'modest' capital raise for Tesla's next strategic turn Clinton makes history with Democratic nomination for president Breakingviews: Hillary Clintons one percent dilemma gets more awkward The July 22-26 poll found that 39 percent of likely voters supported Trump, 37 percent supported Clinton and 24 percent would vote for neither. The poll had a credibility interval of 4 percentage points, meaning that the two candidates should be considered about even in support.  Clinton held a three-point lead on Friday, which was also within the credibility interval.  Clinton has solidly led Trump in the poll throughout most of the 2016 presidential race. The only times that Trump has matched her level of support were when the Republican Party appeared to be roughly aligned with his campaign.  In early May, Trump briefly pulled even with Clinton after his remaining rivals for the party nomination dropped out of the running. He held a 0.3 percentage point lead over Clinton on May 9, the last time he was nominally ahead.  Trump fell back in the poll as he feuded with party bosses over comments he made about Hispanics, Muslims and immigrants, but he rebounded this month as his candidacy took the national spotlight at the Cleveland convention.  The Democratic party is hoping for a similar boost during its convention this week in Philadelphia, but the confab had a rough start: the Wikileaks website released emails on Friday that enraged many voters who had supported Clintons rival for the nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, showing that party officials had looked for ways to undermine his candidacy.  The chair of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, announced her resignation afterward.  On Monday, some speakers at the Democratic convention were booed by Sanders supporters, and hundreds of protesters took to the streets to protest Clintons candidacy.  Presidential candidates usually get a boost in popularity following their party conventions.  In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney jumped by 5 percentage points to pull about even with President Barack Obama after the Republican convention. After the Democrats held their convention, Obama then rose by a few percentage points and again pulled ahead.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English with about 962 likely voters.

U.S. opens door to a change in blood donation policy for gay men,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration opened the door on Tuesday to a change in its blood donor deferral recommendations, which currently prohibit donations from gay men for a year following their last sexual encounter in order to reduce the risk of transmitting HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. In December the FDA overturned a 30-year ban on all blood donations from men who have sex with men, saying the change was based on science showing an indefinite ban was not necessary to prevent transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus. The FDA is now signaling it may go further. Gay rights advocates say the latest update did not go far enough and that the agencys recommendations should move closer to individual risk assessments, which could, for example, look at whether an individual has been in a monogamous relationship. Their criticism intensified in the wake of a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June, which saw many gay men unable to donate blood even as blood banks put out calls for donors. In a notice posted to the Federal Register, the FDA said it was establishing a public docket for comment about its current recommendations and that interested people should submit comments, backed by scientific evidence, supporting alternative potential policies to reduce the risk of HIV transmission.  Such suggestions could include the feasibility of moving from the existing time-based deferrals related to risk behaviors to alternate deferral options, such as the use of individual risk assessments. The agency said it would take the comments into account as it continues to reevaluate and update blood donor deferral policies as new scientific information becomes available. The FDAs action comes after 115 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, led by Democrat Mike Quigley, vice chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, wrote to FDA Commissioner Robert Califf calling on him to end the current policy, saying it discriminated against men who have sex with men. A similar letter was signed by 22 senators. In a statement on Tuesday, Quigley said he was encouraged by the FDAs announcement. The tragedy at Pulse nightclub in Orlando highlighted the discrimination gay and bisexual men face when attempting to donate blood to those in need, he said. Moving towards an individual risk assessment would provide for a fair, equitable, nondiscriminatory blood donation policy, one based in science that allows all healthy Americans to safely donate blood.

Trump pledges reforms at Veterans Administration if elected,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump sought to turn a scandal involving the Veterans Administration to his political advantage on Tuesday, pledging to war veterans that he would clean up a mess he blamed on Washington politicians. Our debt to you is eternal, Trump told a gathering of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Charlotte, North Carolina. Yet our politicians have totally failed you. The 2014 VA scandal revolved around long wait times for patients and other negligent activities. Trump spoke shortly after the crowd heard from Bob McDonald, President Barack Obamas secretary of Veterans Affairs. The scandal fits in with Trumps effort to portray himself as a political outsider dedicated to fixing the problems left by Washington special interests. The VA scandals that have occurred are widespread and totally inexcusable, he said. Trump is on his first campaign swing with his vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, after they were nominated last week at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. They made two stops in North Carolina, a state that could be crucial to their chances in the Nov. 8 election. The New York real estate developer pledged to set up a White House hot line for a ranking official to keep track of reform efforts in the VA to ensure they are carried out. If a problem cannot get solved, he said, I will pick up the phone personally and get it completed and get it taken care of. ",politicsNews,"July 26, 2016 ",1
"Orban says Trump's migration, foreign policy plans 'vital' for Hungary","BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Tuesday said the migration and foreign policy plans of U.S. Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump were vital for Hungary, whereas those of rival Democrat Hillary Clinton were deadly.  The outspoken conservative leader Orban is the first European head of state to express a clear preference for either of the two candidates, who will face each other in elections in November 2016. Orban has in the past upset fellow members of the European Union over policy, most recently with his tough stance on Europes migrant crisis, objecting to EU resettlement plans and having a fence built along Hungarys southern border.  Orban said the U.S. Democrats supported migration as well as what he described as democracy export, while Hungary - like Trump - opposed both, making it clear where Hungarys interests lie. The Democrats foreign policy is bad for Europe, and deadly for Hungary, he said. The migration and foreign policy advocated by the Republican candidate, Mr Trump, is good for Europe and vital for Hungary. Orban had on Saturday called Trumps security policies valiant. His remarks came after Trump raised ire for telling the New York Times last week that he would tie any U.S. military help to NATO allies to conditions in the event of a Russian attack. Clintons campaign struggles to contain the political fallout from a leak of thousands of emails in a hacker attack that they said were designed to help Trump. Experts and U.S. officials say the attack came from Russia. Both Moscow and the Trump campaign have said those claims were absurd. Orbans government has unnerved some partners with its close ties to Russia. It secured large business deals with Moscow, such as the construction of a big new nuclear power plant, and criticized the European Unions embargo on Russia. Hungarys foreign policy has borne an eerie resemblance to Russian diplomatic interests in recent years, and indeed has been little short of an extended arm of the Russian government in foreign policy matters, Political Capital analyst Peter Kreko said. I dont think Putin is behind the budding relationship between Trump and Orban but both are interested in improving Russian ties so theirs is an alliance of interests.

"Behind Democrats' email leak, U.S. experts see a Russian subplot","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If the Russian government is behind the theft and release of embarrassing emails from the Democratic Party, as U.S. officials have suggested, it may reflect less a love of Donald Trump or enmity for Hillary Clinton than a desire to discredit the U.S. political system. A U.S. official who is taking part in the investigation said that intelligence collected on the hacking of Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails released by Wikileaks on Friday indicates beyond a reasonable doubt that it originated in Russia. The timing on the eve of Clintons formal nomination this week for the Nov. 8 presidential election has raised questions about whether Russia may have been trying to hurt her, to help Trump, her Republican rival, or to fan populist sentiment against establishment politicians as it has sought to do across Europe in recent years. Certainly Russia has become a master at manipulating informationfor their strategic goals: Witness the information bubble they have created for their threatening behavior in the Crimea, the Ukraine and elsewhere, said former CIA and National Security Agency director Michael Hayden. A step like this, however, would be really upping their game. The emails showed that DNC officials explored ways to undermine U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders presidential campaign against Clinton and raised questions about whether Sanders, who is Jewish, was really an atheist. The disclosures confirmed Sanders frequent charge that the party played favorites against him and clouded a party convention Clinton hoped would signal unity, not division. Two U.S. intelligence officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the hack could be part of a broader campaign by Russian President Vladimir Putin to push back against what he thinks is an effort by the European Union and NATO, a military alliance of European and North American democracies, to encircle and weaken Russia. One of the officials called the fear a hangover from Putins service in the KGB, the Soviet intelligence agency. Time and again, were seeing Russia push back at what Putin considers Russias mortal enemies, said the other official. Hes been actively attacking the U.S.-backed rebels in Syria, buzzing ships and planes in the Black Sea and the Baltic, not to mention invading Ukraine and seizing Crimea. This fits the pattern. Despite Clintons short-lived attempt as secretary of state to reset U.S.-Russian relations after U.S. President Barack Obama took office in 2009, the leaked emails could damage a candidate the Kremlin may consider hostile and benefit her opponent, who has been friendlier. Putin accused Clinton of stirring up protests against his rule after a December 2011 Russian parliamentary election that was marred by allegations of fraud, saying she had encouraged mercenary Kremlin foes by criticizing the vote. She set the tone for some opposition activists, gave them a signal, they heard this signal and started active work, Putin told supporters. Asked about claims that Russian intelligence had hacked the DNC to obtain the emails, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange told NBC News Richard Engel there is no proof of that whatsoever and said this is a diversion pushed by the Clinton campaign. TRUMPS WARMER TONEAnalysts said Russias goal may be much broader than simply meddling in the U.S. presidential election. Its a gross oversimplification to suggest that the Russian government is all-in for Donald Trump, said Andrew Weiss, a Russia analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington-based think tank. Its in Russias interest ... to portray the United States as riven with popular discontent, xenophobia and high-level political corruption, Weiss said. It fits nicely with the Kremlins standard narrative ... that the White House rushes to criticize others without getting its own house in order. The Russian leader may well have been encouraged by Trumps comments to The New York Times last week that with him in the White House, NATO might not automatically defend the Baltic states that were once a part of the Russian-led Soviet Union. Despite public Trump-Putin exchanges of praise, Eugene Rumer, a former national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia, warned against reaching any quick conclusions about Putins view of Trump.  We can say with some degree of confidence that they dont like Hillary, Rumer said. Its less clear that they like Trump, although over the years the Russians have said they prefer to deal with the Republicans  (that) they are kind of hard-line but they can do deals. A diplomat with experience working on Russia said the Kremlin also might be betting that Clinton will win and is sending a shot across her bow.  Messing with her like this now puts her on notice that these are tough guys that shes got to be really careful with, said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. A U.S. intelligence official who is reviewing the emails as part of the investigation into their origin said that those emails describing the privileges the Democratic National Committee showers on its wealthiest donors bolster the Russian narrative of an American political system rigged by the wealthy and riddled with corruption. In addition to countering the U.S. narrative that the Russian government is a corrupt oligarchy, leaking these emails fits rather conveniently with Trumps charges about a rigged system and crooked Hillary, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss domestic politics.

Some in Sanders' army seem determined to march on without him,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - It should have been a triumphant night for Hillary Clinton when her rival Bernie Sanders gave a rousing speech urging his supporters to vote for her in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Instead it turned into a sign of potential trouble for her White House bid. His speech on Monday to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia urging the party to unite against Republican Donald Trump was met with some jeers when he endorsed Clinton  a sign he had lost control of his own movement. Im beyond disappointed, California delegate Aleece Depuey, 49, said after Sanders sought to rally support for his one-time rival.   Hundreds of Sanders supporters marched through the streets on Day One of the four-day convention, chanting: We want Bernie! Delegates wore Bernie or Bust buttons. Others donned Robin Hood-style hats, a call to redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor.  When he spoke, a scuffle broke out between a Sanders supporter and a Clinton supporter in the hall.  The backlash raised questions over whether - and how - Clinton could ever win over Sanders supporters.  With opinion polls showing the Clinton-Trump race tightening, Clinton needs Sanders voters more than ever. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, arrived in Philadelphia with 1,894 of 4,763 delegates after winning 13 million votes in the Democratic nominating contest. To many of Sanders backers, Clinton is a bridge too far. They see her as the kind of political insider, backed by reams of corporate money, that drove them to Sanders and his fight to rein in Wall Street and remove income inequality. Others simply do not trust her, opinion polls show.  In a Reuters/Ipsos poll released at the end of June, some 15 percent of Sanders backers said they would vote for Trump, and 19 percent would support neither Clinton nor Trump. Sanders won the states of Colorado, Indiana, Michigan, and New Hampshire in the run-up to the convention, and nearly won Iowa - all states that could be closely contested by Trump in the general election. Clinton likely will need some portion of Sanders support to stay competitive in those states.  Clintons campaign had hoped in Philadelphia to put the bare-knuckle primary fight behind it, but Sanders voters were enraged by Fridays embarrassing release of internal party emails by the activist group WikiLeaks showing party officials clearly favored Clinton over their candidate.  Sanders supporters seemed to be everywhere, often with a bigger presence than Clinton supporters, a jarring sight at an event where she is due to be formally nominated as the partys presidential candidate.   At a delegate welcoming event on Sunday night, shouts of Bernie! filled the air as his supporters circulated a petition to force convention organizers to hold an extended roll-call vote on the floor this week that would require each delegate to declare his or her support. Others pledged to contest Clintons choice of Democrat Tim Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia, as her running mate.  When at mid-day Sanders addressed more than a thousand of his delegates at the citys convention center, the crowd erupted in fury when he asked them to switch their allegiance to Clinton. Brothers and sisters, he said over their jeers, this is the real world that we live in. Trump is a bully and a demagogue. People started shouting back: So is Hillary! Sanders did not mention Clinton again. But he already had lost the attention of some of his most fervent fans. As soon as he said back Clinton, everyone stopped listening, said Cindy Melchert, a protester who listened to the appeal over a loudspeaker at a local park. A Michigan native, Melchert said she would not vote for Clinton in November under any circumstances. For her, the movement now was less about Sanders and more about showing the Democratic National Committee they had us and absolutely lost us. Another protester, Michael Arnold of Atlanta, would not have been out of place at a Trump rally, sporting a T-shirt that read Hillary for prison.  Fearing a similar scene on the convention floor would embarrass Clinton, Sanders campaign emailed delegates before Monday nights program, urging them to restrain themselves. Our credibility as a movement will be damaged by booing, turning of backs, walking out or other similar displays, it read. Some Sanders supporters appeared willing to set aside their qualms about Clinton, largely out of a desire to see Trump defeated in the election. Diana Hatsis-Neuhoff, a delegate from Florida adorned with buttons backing Sanders, said she planned to vote for Clinton in the general election. Yes, she said, well hold our nose and vote. Others felt their fellow Sanders supporters had taken the movement too far. We are surrounded by people who are so selfish and so self-absorbed, said Melissa Robbins, who worked for the Sanders campaign in Philadelphia. Not voting for Hillary is a sure win for Donald Trump. But that may not be enough to sway Sue Spicer from Indiana, who said she had trouble imagining voting for either Clinton or Trump. Its hard to feel they have our best interests in mind, she said.

"An Obama, not the president, brings down the house at Democratic convention","PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Democrats divided over the future of their party agreed on at least one thing at their national convention in Philadelphia on Monday night: Michelle Obama was a star. The first lady gave a speech in support of a former first lady, presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, and described America as the greatest country on earth, clashing with Republican Donald Trumps Make America Great Again slogan and bringing an arena crowd riven by a fierce fight for the nomination to its feet. I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves, and I watch my daughters - two beautiful, intelligent, black young women  playing with their dogs on the White House lawn, Michelle Obama said.  Obamas husband, President Barack Obama, for years has drawn praise for his oratorical skills. But Monday night belonged to her. Dont let anyone ever tell you that this country isnt great, that somehow we need to make it great again, because this right now is the greatest country on earth, she said. The speech triggered wild applause among delegates in the Wells Fargo Center, where anger over Senator Bernie Sanders loss in the primary elections against Clinton had taken the form of jeers during speeches earlier in the day.  Some Sanders supporters had called out at some points early in Obamas speech, but were shushed. Garry Mauro, head of the Clinton delegation for Texas, called Michelle Obamas speech stunningly good. Several Twitter users said the speech brought them to tears, while others marveled at its positive tone in an election year marked by blunt exchanges. Mrs. Obama deconstructed Trumps entire campaign without using a single pejorative word, Twitter user @weddady said in a post after the speech. Mrs Obamas speech also disassembled Trumps entire narrative without ever mentioning his name. Michelle Obama became the top searched speaker of the night on Google.On Twitter, about 40 tweets mentioning the first lady were posted every second, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph. The president lauded her performance. Incredible speech by an incredible woman. Couldnt be more proud & our country has been blessed to have her as FLOTUS. I love you, Michelle, he wrote in a Twitter post, using an acronym for first lady of the United States. His tweet became the most re-tweeted post of the night. Michelle Obama, a lawyer who has advocated for military families and working women during her seven-and-a-half years as first lady, has earned a reputation for inspirational speeches.  Last week, during the Republican National Convention, Trumps wife Melania delivered a speech that appeared to borrow phrases from Michelle Obamas convention speech in 2008, drawing accusations of plagiarism. A Trump Organization staff writer accepted responsibility for the similarities. One can completely understand why people plagiarize Michelle Obama, actress Mia Farrow said in a Twitter post after the first ladys speech. ",politicsNews,"July 26, 2016 ",1

Email leak may hurt Democratic party chair's re-election bid,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An email leak that led to the resignation of Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz could plague her bid for re-election to Congress, after a challenger said on Monday he would file a complaint alleging she had broken election rules. Political newcomer Tim Canova, who is challenging Wasserman Schultz in the Aug. 30 Democratic primary for her House of Representatives seat representing Floridas 23rd Congressional District, said he would file the complaint against her with the U.S. Federal Election Commission. Wasserman Schultz said on Sunday she would be stepping down as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee after Wikileaks released more than 19,000 emails showing Democratic officials had worked to undermine U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in his presidential primary battle with Hillary Clinton. Canova suggested that the leaked emails also showed Wasserman Schultz had used the partys resources in her congressional campaign against Canova in south Florida. Sanders has endorsed Canova in that race.  The Wikileaks emails indicate thatDebbieWasserman Schultz used DNC resources to assist her reelection campaign in violation of federal law. According to the emails, top DNC officials used party resources to monitor, respond to, and impede my campaign on numerous occasions, Canova said in a statement emailed to Reuters by his campaign. My campaign election lawyers are investigating these circumstances and preparing a complaint against Wasserman Schultz with the Federal Election Commission, Canova said. He also repeated his call for a series of campaign debates with Wasserman Schultz. Searching for Canovas name in the cache of emails released by WikiLeaks turned up dozens of emails. One indicated Wasserman Schultz had asked staffers to take Canovas name out of a headline on a statement that was being sent out in response to Sanderss endorsement of Canova. Sanders told CNN in May that he favored Canova, saying His views are much closer to mine than as to Wasserman Schultzs.  Canovas south Florida campaign for Congress has reflected some of the themes that Sanders used nationwide to appeal to progressives, including a push for campaign finance reform. Canova has also been a critic of financial deregulation and the Federal Reserve Board under former Chairman Alan Greenspan, according to his biography on the website at Nova Southeastern University, where he is a professor of law and public finance. Sanders made attacks on Wall Street a central theme of his presidential campaign, and called for structural reforms in the Fed. Since Sanders endorsement, Canova has almost caught up with Wasserman Schultz in fundraising. Canova has raised $2.27 million so far; Wasserman Schultz has raised $2.81 million, according to the most recent Federal Election Commission filings.    There are also two Republicans seeking Wasserman Schultzs seat in Congress, Martin Feigenbaum and Joe Kaufman. ",politicsNews,"July 25, 2016 ",1
Trump says he would consider alliance with Russia over Islamic State,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - Republican nominee Donald Trump said on Monday that if elected U.S. president he would weigh an alliance with Russia against Islamic State militants but rejected any suggestion Russian President Vladimir Putin might be trying to help him win. Speaking at a rally in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Trump dismissed any suggestion that Putins intelligence services might have had a hand in hacking the Democratic National Committees email system. Emails leaked last week disclosed that some party officials had been in favor of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton winning the Democratic presidential nomination over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and sought ways to thwart Sanders. The uproar over the WikiLeaks revelations prompted Debbie Wasserman Schultz to resign as DNC chairwoman, and Trump eagerly injected himself into the controversy. Trump dismissed a charge from Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook that Russian hackers might have stolen the emails and leaked them to embarrass Democrats and help Trump defeat Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. I dont think its coincidental that these emails were released on the eve of our convention here, and I think thats disturbing, Mook told CNNs State of the Union. Trump dismissed what he called one of the weirdest conspiracy theories he said he had heard. He said he had never met Putin. But over the course of his year-long campaign, Trump has praised the Russian leader and one of his top foreign policy advisers, retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, had dinner with Putin last December. When you think about it, wouldnt it be nice if we got along with Russia? Trump said. Wouldnt it be nice if we got together with Russia and knocked the hell out of ISIS? he added, using another name for Islamic State. As it happens, skeptics in the U.S. government, European allies in the anti-Islamic State coalition and the main Syrian opposition, distrustful of Russias intentions, are questioning Secretary of State John Kerrys own latest proposal for closer U.S.-Russian cooperation against militant groups in Syria. Trump, kicking off a three-day campaign swing with his vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, returned to his freewheeling style after giving a scripted speech on Thursday accepting the Republican presidential nomination. During an earlier event in Roanoke, Virginia, Trump labeled Clinton low-energy, the same characterization he lobbed at Republican rival Jeb Bush; attacked her running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia; and complained about the air conditioning in the hotel ballroom where he spoke. I think the ballroom and the people who own this hotel ought to be ashamed of themselves, Trump said. Trump made light of Democratic disunity as party loyalists gathered in Philadelphia on Monday to anoint Clinton as their nominee this week, after a week in which Republicans struggled to unite behind Trump at their convention in Cleveland. Trump waved away Republican disunity as essentially isolated pockets of resistance and made an apparent reference to U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, who was booed in Cleveland when he would not endorse Trump after losing to him in a bitter primary race. We had a couple people who probably destroyed their career, but who knows, Trump said. Look whats going on in Philadelphia. ... We had no riots, no nothing. It was unbelievable. Ill never forget it as long as I live. On Twitter, Trump added, Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. ",politicsNews,"July 25, 2016 ",1
Democrats in disarray on eve of convention to nominate Clinton,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - The head of the Democratic Party resigned on Sunday amid a furor over embarrassing leaked emails, hoping to head off a growing rebellion by Bernie Sanders supporters on the eve of the convention to nominate Hillary Clinton for the White House. Lingering bitterness from the heated primary campaign between Clinton and Sanders erupted after more than 19,000 Democratic National Committee emails, leaked on Friday, confirmed Sanders frequent charge that the party played favorites in the race. In a statement, DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said the best way for the party to accomplish its goal of putting Clinton in the White House was for her to step aside after the convention. Sanders had demanded earlier in the day that Wasserman Schultz resign. The furor was a blow to a party keen on projecting stability in contrast to the volatility of Republican candidate Donald Trump, who was formally nominated at a raucous convention in Cleveland last week. It also overshadowed preparations in Philadelphia for Clintons coronation as the nominee to face Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election. She will be the first woman nominated for president by a major U.S. political party.  The four-day Democratic convention will open on Monday. In some good news for Clinton, The New York Times reported that businessman and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg will endorse her in a prime-time speech on Monday, saying she will be the best choice for moderate voters in 2016. The cache of emails leaked on Friday by the WikiLeaks website disclosed that DNC officials explored ways to undermine Sanders insurgent presidential campaign, including raising questions about whether Sanders, who is Jewish, was really an atheist. Sanders said Wasserman Schultz, a U.S. representative from Florida, had made the right decision for the future of the Democratic Party. The party leadership must also always remain impartial in the presidential nominating process, something which did not occur in the 2016 race, he said. The Clinton camp questioned whether Russians may have had a hand in the hack attack on the partys emails and were interested in helping Trump, who has exchanged words of praise with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Whats disturbing to us is that experts are telling us that Russian state actors broke into the DNC, stole these emails and other experts are now saying that Russians are releasing these emails for the purpose of helping Donald Trump, Clinton campaign chairman Robby Mook said on CNNs State of the Union. Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort said the Clinton camp was trying to distract from its party discord ahead of the convention. Whats in those emails show that it was a clearly rigged system, that Bernie Sanders ... never had a chance, Manafort said on ABC.  Clinton, 68, a former secretary of state, and Sanders, 74, an independent U.S. senator from Vermont who ran for president as a Democrat, waged a bruising months-long battle for the nomination. Branding himself a democratic socialist, Sanders galvanized young and liberal voters with his calls to rein in Wall Street and eradicate income inequality.    But Sanders repeatedly voiced frustration with a DNC and party establishment he felt was stacked against him, and the resentment from Sanders and his supporters threatened to disrupt the convention. Im not shocked but Im disappointed, Sanders said of the emails earlier on Sunday on ABCs This Week. The emails showed DNC officials pondering various ways to undercut Sanders. Brad Marshall, the DNCs chief financial officer, apologized on Facebook on Saturday for an email in which he discussed how some voters in upcoming nominating contests in Kentucky and West Virginia would reject an atheist. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage, Marshall wrote in a May 5 email to three top DNC officials. No names were mentioned, but Sanders was the only Jewish candidate. I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist. Clinton told CBSs 60 Minutes in an interview that aired on Sunday that she had not read any of the emails but it was wrong and unacceptable to bring religion into the political process. The emails angered many Sanders supporters who were already dismayed by Clintons choice on Friday of low-key U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia as her vice presidential running mate. Kaine, 58, who could appeal to independents and moderates, has never been aligned with party liberals. Sanders, who has endorsed Clinton and will speak on her behalf to the convention on Monday, said he would have preferred she pick U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a favorite of the partys liberal wing, as her No. 2. I have known Tim Kaine for a number of years. ... Tim is a very, very smart guy. He is a very nice guy, Sanders said on NBCs Meet the Press.  He is more conservative than I am. Would I have preferred to see somebody like an Elizabeth Warren selected by Secretary Clinton? Yes, I would have, he said.  Carrying pitchforks meant to portray Clinton as the devil, hundreds of Sanders supporters took to the streets of Philadelphia earlier on Sunday to say they felt betrayed by the DNC. It just validated everything we thought, everything we believed to be true, that this was completely rigged right from the beginning, and that you know it was really about what they were doing everything to set it up so she would win, Sanders supporter Gwen Sperling said. DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile will serve as interim chair through the election, the DNC said on Twitter. ",politicsNews,"July 24, 2016 ",1
"U.S. lawmaker wants new budget requests for Iraq, Afghanistan troops","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee called on the Obama administration on Monday to ask Congress for more money to fund its plans for Iraq and Afghanistan, amid expectations of a defense budget battle when lawmakers return to Washington this fall. The administration needs to come over with a supplemental (budget request), Republican Representative Mac Thornberry said at a roundtable discussion with reporters shortly after returning from a trip to Iraq and Afghanistan. He said U.S. and allied forces were making progress in Afghanistan and in the fight against Islamic State militants in Iraq, but that stiff challenges remained in both campaigns. Thornberry and other congressional Republicans have been saying President Barack Obama must formally request additional funds for the fiscal year that starts on Oct. 1 since he announced plans earlier this month to send more troops to Iraq and keep more in Afghanistan than had been expected. The request for more troops, without a plan to pay for them, added another wrinkle to the simmering dispute between the Republican-led Congress and the Democratic administration over spending. Obama has threatened to veto a $602 billion defense policy bill because of its use of special funds for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to avoid mandatory budget limits. Democrats say the Department of Defense should be subject to the same spending restrictions as non-military programs. Republicans accuse Democrats of stinting on national security in order to fund pet domestic projects. That is holding our military hostage, Thornberry said. The congressman said he had had no official numbers from the Pentagon but that he had been told it faces roughly $6 billion more in expenses than when the administration made its budget request earlier this year. He said military commanders in Afghanistan were grappling with how to handle Obamas plan to reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan to 8,448 by December 31 from about 9,800 currently. They are looking into using more contractors and whether some functions can be moved out of Afghanistan, Thornberry said.  Defense Secretary Ash Carter has said the Pentagon was evaluating how to proceed, comparing its estimated costs with what is already in its budgets. ",politicsNews,"July 25, 2016 ",1
"Illinois Republican lawmaker resigns, cites Facebook, Twitter hacks","CHICAGO (Reuters) - A prominent Illinois Republican has resigned from the state legislature, citing multiple incidents of fake Facebook and Twitter accounts set up in his name in recent weeks.  After some cyber security issues arose, I began to re-evaluate my continued public service, Representative Ron Sandack, House Republican floor leader, said in a resignation letter dated Sunday and provided on Monday by the Republican Caucus. Sandack, known as an adamant defender of Republican Governor Bruce Rauners initiatives on the floor of the Democratic-dominated House, was up for re-election in November against Democrat Greg Hose. His resignation comes as both major U.S. political parties are increasingly bedeviled by hacking, including Fridays leak of emails that have embarrassed Democrats as they gather for the partys convention in Philadelphia this week. Sandack had been battling since July 4 to remove multiple fake Facebook and Twitter accounts in his name, he told Capitol Fax, a respected political blog based in Springfield, the state capital. It is not clear what, if anything, the fake accounts posted in his name. Sandack, who was an active user of social media, has shut down his Facebook and Twitter accounts and has filed a police report regarding the fake ones, Capitol Fax reported. A spokeswoman for Jim Durkin, leader of the House Republicans, did not respond to a question on who would replace Sandack as Republican candidate for his seat. Rauner did not respond to reporters questions about Sandack following an event on Monday morning.  Sandack is a Chicago lawyer and former mayor of Downers Grove, Illinois. He was appointed in 2010 to the Illinois Senate to fill in for a senator who resigned, and went on to be elected as representative for his suburban Chicago district. In his resignation notice he also said he was no longer willing to miss so many family events. ",politicsNews,"July 25, 2016 ",1
"Democratic Party email leak points to Russia: cyber experts, U.S. officials","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cyber security experts and U.S. officials said on Monday there was evidence that Russia engineered the release of sensitive Democratic Party emails in order to influence the U.S. presidential election. The FBI said it was investigating a cyber intrusion at the Democratic National Committee (DNC), which has led to discord as  the partys convention in Philadelphia opens on Monday to nominate former U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton as its candidate. Although the hacking of the DNC was known to officials and cyber security experts a month ago, the timing of the release of the contents of communications within the party is what is causing concern for U.S. authorities. A U.S. official involved in the investigation said that the classified information collected on the hack so far indicated beyond a reasonable doubt that it originated in Russia.  The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the timing of the release of emails has all the hallmarks of a classic intelligence operation intended to damage a perceived adversary. The official said, however, that it may be impossible to prove definitively that Russian President Vladimir Putins government directed the attack. The emails, released by activist group WikiLeaks at the weekend, appeared to show favoritism within the DNC for Clinton over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who ran a close race for the nomination for the Nov. 8 election. The committee is supposed to be neutral and the disclosure forced chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a congresswoman from Florida, to resign. The U.S. House of Representatives intelligence committee has been briefed and will seek information on any potential connection to Russia or any other state, said Representative Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the panel. That foreign actors may be trying to influence our election - let alone a powerful adversary like Russia - should concern all Americans of any party. Schiff said in a statement. On Sunday, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told CNN that the campaign had been told by experts that the emails were released by suspected Russian hackers to help Republican Party nominee Donald Trump. The businessmans campaign dismissed the allegation as absurd. Trump has often praised Putin, calling him a strong leader. Trump is a critic of NATO and last week he  told The New York Times that he might not back countries in the alliance if they were attacked by Russia, unless he was sure they had made sufficient contributions to the group.  Russia has long been considered among the most elite U.S. adversaries in cyberspace, though its actions are generally viewed as efforts at covert intelligence gathering. Usually, the Russians are not ham-handed, said Jim Lewis, a cyber security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. He said Russia was believed to have hacked Democratic and Republican campaigns in 2008, but that it did not leak material. It would be a bold move to try and shape the election, but we cant rule it out, Lewis said. CrowdStrike, a cyber firm that helped clean up the breach, said last month it had identified two hacking groups that infiltrated the DNC and that both were believed to be working on behalf of two competing arms of the Russian government. Its findings were later supported by similar conclusions reached by FireEyes (FEYE.O) Mandiant unit and Fidelis, two other U.S.-based cyber companies.   Experts said that forensic analysis of the breach also links the same hackers to attacks at the White House, the State Department, the German Bundestag and private companies. The Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to say when its probe of the hack began. A compromise of this nature is something we take very seriously, and the FBI will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace, it said in a statement. WikiLeaks released more than 19,000 DNC emails on Saturday. On Twitter it rejected as speculation claims made that Russia was the source of the cache. The group also said that there would be more leaks related to the U.S. election. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he could not speak to the veracity of private sector conclusions pointing to Russia as the culprit in the DNC hack, but that he was confident the FBI would thoroughly investigate the matter.

Florida man admits helping funnel 2012 foreign political contribution,"(Reuters) - A Florida man pleaded guilty on Monday to working with another man to illegally funnel $80,000 in foreign contributions to U.S. President Barack Obamas joint fundraising committee in 2012 so that a foreign national could attend a campaign event. William Argeros, 57, pleaded guilty in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, to charges that he knowingly and willfully made foreign contributions and donations and made a false  declaration to a federal grand jury, prosecutors said. U.S. law prohibits contributions from foreign nationals to candidates or fundraising committees in federal elections. A lawyer for Argeros did not respond to a request for comment. The Tampa, Florida, resident is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 9. The proceedings came a month after an earlier guilty plea in the case by Bilal Shehu, a New Jersey limousine driver to whom prosecutors said Argeros facilitated the transferring of $80,000 from a foreign source. Prosecutors said Shehu, a Paramus, New Jersey resident, then provided the money to Obamas joint fundraising committee so that a foreign national could attend a campaign event on Oct. 8, 2012, in San Francisco. In announcing both guilty pleas, prosecutors have not specifically identified the foreign source of the money or the foreign national. But the cases came after a Republican congressman in 2013 called for investigations into the purchases by Shehus family of two $40,000 tickets for a San Francisco fundraiser, one of which was used by now-Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama. At the October 2012 event, Rama, the Albanian Socialist Party leader, was photographed with Obama. U.S. Representative Dana Rohrabacher of California at the time contended the photo was then used for deceitful purposes by Rama to imply a relationship with Obama during Albanias own election, which brought him into leadership. Prosecutors have said that the foreign national in the case was denied entry to the campaign event but was allowed to be photographed with Obama. Prosecutors said no one on the joint election committee has been accused of any wrongdoing and that it had cooperated fully in the investigation. ",politicsNews,"July 25, 2016 ",1

Obama's brother plans to vote for Trump," NAIROBI (Reuters) - President Barack Obamas half-brother, Malik Obama, says he will vote for Republican nominee Donald Trump in the U.S. election in November because he likes the candidate and he is unhappy with his brothers leadership.  Malik, who is in his 50s, told Reuters by phone from Obamas ancestral home of Kogelo in western Kenya that he supports Trumps policies, especially his focus on security.  He appeals to me and also I think that he is down to earth and he speaks from the heart and he is not trying to be politically correct. Hes just straight-forward, he said.

Trumps stance against Muslims coming in to the United States was understandable even to Muslims like himself, Malik said.  Im a Muslim, of course, but you cant have people going around just shooting people and killing people just in the name of Islam, he said.  He criticized President Obamas record in the White House saying he had not done much for the American people and his extended family despite the high expectations that accompanied his election in 2008, both in the United States and Kenya.  The two men appear to have drifted apart but were previously close. Malik has visited the president in the Oval office and was also best man at Baracks wedding.  Obamas election created much excitement in Kenya especially in Kogelo village where their father was born before going to study at the University of Hawaii.  Obama visited Nairobi, in the first ever trip by a sitting U.S. president to the East African nation last July, and promised to visit more often when he leaves office.

"Attacking Trump, Democrat Kaine makes campaign-trail debut","MIAMI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Tim Kaine made his first appearance on the campaign trail as Hillary Clintons vice presidential running mate on Saturday, touting an optimistic view of America and leaping to attack Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps record. Joining Clinton at a rally in the battleground state of Florida, the bilingual Kaine peppered Spanish-language phrases into a speech focused on introducing himself to voters unfamiliar with the low-key U.S. senator from Virginia. Kaine criticized Trumps recent suggestion he might not honor U.S. security commitments to NATO in Europe, and the real estate moguls history of casino bankruptcies and founding the failed Trump University. When Donald Trump says he has your back, you better watch out, Kaine said, with Clinton sitting at his side nodding. He leaves a trail of broken promises and wrecked lives wherever he goes. We cant afford to let him do the same thing to our country. In contrast, he said, Clinton doesnt insult people, she listens to them. What a novel concept. He said they shared a common creed: Do all the good you can. Clinton unveiled her choice of Kaine late on Friday, grabbing the political spotlight from Trump, who accepted the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday night after a chaotic four-day convention. The former secretary of state will formally be nominated as her partys presidential candidate in the Nov. 8 election at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, which opens on Monday. In choosing the soft-spoken Kaine, a former Richmond mayor and Virginia governor with a long establishment resume, Clinton opted for a steady and experienced hand who she hopes will offer a clear alternative to Trumps volatile campaign and his Republican vice presidential choice Mike Pence. Senator Tim Kaine is everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not. He is qualified to step into this job and lead on day one, Clinton told the Miami crowd. Trump was unimpressed, saying on Twitter he had watched the joint appearance and ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They dont look presidential to me! In his speech, Kaine said he was an optimist and described his childhood in Kansas City helping his father in his metal-working shop and his Catholic mission to Honduras, where he helped teenagers with carpentry and welding and they taught him Spanish. He said in Honduras he learned the values Fe, familia, y trabajo  faith, family, and work. Kaine became emotional when he recalled the 2007 shooting deaths of 32 people at Virginia Tech University during his stint as governor, calling it the worst day of his life. He promised to take on the National Rifle Association and fight for common sense gun control. Judith Sweeney, 58, from West Park, Florida, said she knew little about Kaine before attending the speech but was impressed by his resume and liked his civil rights work and school reform efforts. Wonderful, very experienced, an innovator, she said. Peter Daou, a former adviser to Clinton who now owns a media company, said Kaines speech would turn around some of the doubters about the choice. The combination of his tone, his demeanor, his life story -it just said a lot about her capacity to choose the right person and not listen to pressure from the outside, he said. Clinton is hoping Kaine will help her appeal to independents and moderates, but some supporters of Clintons Democratic primary rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, were dismayed by the choice because of Kaines past advocacy for an Asian free-trade pact. But in a nod to party liberals, the Clinton campaign said Kaine will not support the final version of the 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership, which is pending in the Senate. A spokeswoman for Kaine confirmed his opposition to the pact. The decision drew cheers from liberal groups and labor leaders. Were glad to see the Clinton-Kaine ticket taking steps to campaign on big, bold, populist ideas that voters want to hear from Democrats, said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progessive Change Campaign Committee. Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO labor federation, said Kaines decision to join Clinton in opposing the trade pact sets an irretrievable, progressive path forward for America. In picking Kaine, Clinton passed over liberal candidates who would have generated more grassroots enthusiasm like U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey, and Hispanic Cabinet members Julian Castro and Thomas Perez. Clinton tried to reassure party liberals, offering an extended list of Kaines efforts on behalf of low-income workers, education and civil rights, and for expanded gun control laws and immigration reform. He fights for the people he represents, and he delivers real results, Clinton said, applying one of her favorite self-descriptions to him. When I say hes a progressive who likes to get things done, I mean it. Sanders supporters lost their bid to eliminate or reduce the influence of superdelegates, party leaders who are not bound to any candidate, during a meeting of the convention rules committee in Philadelphia. Sanders had complained about the superdelegates, which overwhelmingly backed Clinton. But enough committee members backed the effort to let them take the fight to the convention floor during next weeks convention, participants said.   ",politicsNews,"July 23, 2016 ",1

"Democrat Clinton picks Kaine as running mate, bypassing liberals","WASHINGTON/TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton named U.S. Senator Tim Kaine as her running mate on Friday, opting for an experienced governing partner who will help her present the Democratic ticket as a steady alternative to the unpredictable campaign of Republican presidential rival Donald Trump. The selection of Kaine, a self-described boring Virginian with a reputation for low-key competence, could appeal to independents and moderates, but it quickly angered liberal groups that object to his advocacy for an Asian free-trade pact. The Spanish-speaking former Virginia governor and Richmond mayor fit Clintons long-stated criteria that the vice presidential choice be a capable and reliable partner who is ready to take over the presidency if necessary. Clinton made the announcement via Twitter and a text message to supporters after the first day of a two-day campaign swing in Florida. She called Kaine to tell him about 40 minutes before the announcement, and called President Barack Obama shortly after Kaine. Im thrilled to tell you this first: Ive chosen Sen. Tim Kaine as my running mate. Welcome him to my team, she said in her text message. Kaine, 58, edged out two other finalists - Cory Booker, a U.S. senator from New Jersey, and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, according to a Democratic source familiar with the discussions. Clinton also bypassed candidates who would have generated more excitement among liberal and Hispanic activists, including progressive favorite U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and two Hispanic members of Obamas Cabinet, Julian Castro and Thomas Perez. The former secretary of state will be formally nominated as the partys presidential candidate for the Nov. 8 election at next weeks Democratic convention in Philadelphia. She leads Trump in many opinion polls. Clintons choice of a running mate could give her campaign momentum heading into the convention, as the fight for the White House begins a more than three-month push to the finish.             Clinton, 68, acknowledged in an interview earlier this week that even Kaine admits he is boring, and said she did not mind. I love that about him, she told Charlie Rose of CBS News and PBS. Hes never lost an election. He was a world-class mayor, governor and senator and is one of the most highly respected senators I know. A campaign official said Clinton was impressed with Kaines down-to-earth style when she campaigned with him in Virginia last week. Afterwards, Kaine went back to her house in Washington, D.C., for a 90-minute evening meeting. Two days later, Kaine and his wife, Anne, joined Clinton in New York for lunch, along with Clintons husband, former President Bill Clinton, daughter Chelsea and Chelseas husband. Kaine was the only vice presidential candidate to have a private family lunch during the vetting process, the official said. Clintons campaign chairman, John Podesta, who led the search, offered her advice. It needs to be someone who whenever they walk into a room you are glad to see them and want to have them as part of any conversation, the campaign official quoted Podesta telling her. Kaines first appearance with Clinton will be on Saturday at an event in Miami, a campaign aide said. Just got off the phone with Hillary. Im honored to be her running mate. Cant wait to hit the trail tomorrow in Miami, Kaine said on Twitter. Liberal groups, which had pressured Clinton not to pick Kaine because of his support for fast-track authority for the White House to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership, were dismayed by the choice. Critics of the Asia free-trade deal, including Trump and Clintons Democratic primary rival Bernie Sanders, say it would be unfair to U.S. workers and kill jobs. Clinton praised the deal when she was secretary of state, but has since distanced herself from it. Republicans will run hard against Democrats on trade this year. Unfortunately, since Tim Kaine voted to fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Republicans now have a new opening to attack Democrats on this economic populist issue, said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. Hispanic activists also may be annoyed with the pick of Kaine given that Latino candidates were again passed over, though some Latino advocacy groups praised the choice. She has chosen a running mate that has a track record of advocating and fighting for the issues that affect the Latino community and our nation: immigration, healthcare, womens rights and the environment, said Ben Monterroso, executive director of Mi Familia Vota.  Top Republicans were quick to criticize Clintons choice. The Trump campaign called Kaine an ethically challenged insider and called Clinton and Kaine a Status Quo ticket. If you think Crooked Hillary and Corrupt Kaine are going to change anything in Washington, its just the opposite, campaign aide Jason Miller said in a statement. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus condemned the pick, saying Clinton spent the past week pandering to Sanders and grassroots Democrats, and now has chosen someone who holds positions that shes spent the entire primary trying to get to the left of. But Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who has been critical of Trump, said on Twitter that he was trying to count the ways he hated Tim Kaine. Drawing a blank. Congrats to a good man and a good friend, Flake said.  Kaine could help Clinton in Virginia, a heavily contested swing state, and choosing Kaine will not cost Democrats a seat in the Senate, where Republicans now hold a majority. Virginias Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, a close Clinton friend and ally, will name a replacement for Kaine if he and Clinton win the White House. Some Democrats who know Kaine well dismissed fears that he lacks the toughness to stand up to Republican attacks, given how deftly Trump chewed up low-energy Jeb Bush and little Marco Rubio in the Republican primaries.  Its not the Donald Trump sledgehammer. But hes not a shrinking violet, said Luke Albee, a former chief of staff to Democrat Mark Warner, the senior U.S. senator from Virginia.  Albee, who has watched Kaine up close over the years, added, I wouldnt mistake a thoughtful and genial disposition for an inability to really forcefully articulate differences. Kaine has good relations with senators from the opposing party, according to senior Senate Republican congressional aides. One aide speculated Kaine would be effective in reaching out to congressional Republicans if he becomes vice president, a role that Vice President Joe Biden has played for Obama. Kaine, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, has been a leading voice calling for a formal authorization of war against the Islamic State militant group. He played an important role in securing congressional review of the 2015 international deal on Irans nuclear program, although he eventually backed it. He has a track-record of backing liberal causes such as ending across-the-board automatic budget cuts and providing a pathway to citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants.        Kaine, a Catholic who became fluent in Spanish speaker while serving as a missionary in Honduras, has expressed personal opposition to abortion, but has a public record in support of abortion rights.

Trump pulls nearly even with Clinton after Republican convention: Reuters/Ipsos poll," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has pulled nearly even with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for the first time since May, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken over the course of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this week.  The July 18-22 national online poll found that 41 percent of likely voters supported Clinton, while 38 percent supported Trump. Given the polls credibility interval of about 4 percentage points, Trump and Clinton should be considered to be about even in the race.  MORE ELECTION 2016 COVERAGE: Just before Republicans opened the convention on Monday, Trump had trailed Clinton by nearly 10 percentage points in the poll.  The New York businessman-turned-politician formally accepted the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election during a convention at which the party at times struggled to show unity.  The week started with a dustup between convention leaders and delegates who wanted to change the partys rules to derail Trumps nomination. Later in the week, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who dropped out of the nomination race in May, refused to endorse Trump in a prime-time speech.  Yet, on the final night of the convention, Republicans gave Trump a standing ovation as he pledged to take back a country that he said is plagued by crime, terrorism and ineffective leadership.  Party conventions are partly meant to introduce the candidate to the country, and nominees tend to get a boost in opinion polls afterward. In 2012, then-Republican nominee Mitt Romney rose by about 5 percentage points in the Reuters/Ipsos poll after his partys convention.  Clinton, who is expected to be formally nominated by her party at its convention in Philadelphia next week, has led Trump most of the year in the poll.  The last time Trump drew about even with Clinton was in mid-May, after his last two rivals for the Republican nomination dropped out of the race and party leaders started to get behind his campaign.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted in English in all 50 states with 1,036 likely voters.  ",politicsNews,"July 22, 2016 ",1
Women in male-dominated career fields watch a unique U.S. presidential campaign,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Dr. Linda Liau works with the precision of a master, peering into a patients head with magnifying loupes as she removes a brain tumor. When Liau was called into an emergency room as a surgeon more than 20 years ago to help treat a car crash victim, another member of the medical team assumed she was a nurse. Even today, the 49-year-old neurosurgeon sometimes gets a surprised reaction from new patients who were expecting a man.  Such an assumption is common in career fields dominated by men. Neurosurgery, welding, venture capitalism, construction, film directing and the electrical trade - these are six jobs where U.S. women have made inroads but are still vastly outnumbered. And one position, U.S. president, has never been filled by a woman. With presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton seeking to become the first to break that barrier, several women in career fields made up mostly of men told Reuters that they saw her candidacy as significant. I think ultimately the goal would be to be gender-blind completely, so the fact that were even talking about having a female president as a novelty is, in a way, sad, Liau said. On a construction site, Joundi White, 31, has often been reminded of her gender. Early in her career, the reminders were pet names such as sweetheart and honey. Now, she can rarely shake the sense that she is outnumbered. I eat lunch alone, White said. I dont have people to relate to at work.  Dont get me wrong, I identify more with the guys, but to them, ultimately, Im just a girl. Wearing a hard hat, White passes under heavy steel beams, walking along the commuter train tracks she is helping build in her working-class neighborhood in southern Los Angeles.  Welder Darlene Thompson, 45, is also no stranger to the construction site, or to the hostility that she says women often encounter in the field. These days, she teaches others as an instructor at Los Angeles Trade Technical College.  In a heavy coat and blue gloves, she looks from under her helmet at the white-hot flame of a welding torch.  It was a fight to learn these skills. More than a decade ago, when she began receiving job training as a welfare recipient, Thompson had to argue for the chance to study welding. Public assistance administrators wanted to push her toward cosmetology or culinary arts, she said.  Thompson did not say how she would cast her ballot in November but said she would not vote for Clinton just because the candidate is a woman. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps slogan has resonated with her. When they talk about Lets make America great again, Thompson said, what I think of is the companies in Detroit, the automotive industry going back to Detroit and giving back jobs. A well-paid job as an electrician has opened up opportunities for Hannah Cooper, 28. For one thing, she was able to buy a house in the expensive Los Angeles real estate market. Sometimes, she will encounter someone on a construction site who knows her mother, Kelly Cooper, who also was an electrician.  Everyone remembers her because theres only a few women, Cooper said. Kelly Cooper began as an apprentice in 1975. You have to have thick skin to be anyone in the trade,she said. To be a woman in the trade, you have to have a particularly thick skin.  She is now director of construction for the Los Angeles Department of General Services. Eva Ho, 44, is a woman working in the technology field, which is unusual enough. But she is also a venture capitalist, which is rarer still. In some ways the V.C. career has really been an old boys club, and its been dominated by white men for the last three or four decades, Ho said.  A graduate of Harvard and Cornell, Ho said she was drawn to work in technology because of its ability to drive social change. But she came late to it, never having used a computer until college. For the Burtons, who work together as filmmakers through their company Five Sisters Productions, their career had its seeds in their childhood as the daughters of a writer and a former professional musician.  Both parents were feminists who thought their five daughters could do anything, said Ursula Burton, a director, producer and actor.  Now the possibility of a female president could help create more opportunities for women, she said.  Having a woman president opens up the presidency for girls, Burton said, and it will shift the perception for boys of what girls can do.  ",politicsNews,"July 23, 2016 ",1
Hungary's Orban likes what he hears of 'valiant' Trump's security plans,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Saturday said Donald Trump had proposed security policies that Europe should take to heart to solve a security crisis he blames on uncontrolled immigration. Speaking at a summer university in Baile Tusnad, Romania, the Hungarian leader tied increased security threats to increased migration and cited Trumps proposals at the Republican National Convention to combat terrorism. Orban is one of Europes most outspoken politicians and has in the past upset fellow members of the European Union over policy. Most recently he has taken a tough stance on Europes  migrant crisis, objecting to EU resettlement plans and calling for a razor wire fence to be built along his countrys southern border. Trump accepted the Republican nomination for president on Thursday with a speech that outlined an increased intelligence effort, an end to a failed policy of nation-building and regime change and a total suspension of immigration from states compromised by terrorism. He wants a wall to be built along the U.S. border with Mexico. Orban sought to buttress his own security proposals with Trumps points. I am not a Donald Trump campaigner, he said in the televised speech. I never thought I would ever entertain the thought that, of the open options, he (Trump) would be better for Europe and for Hungary. But I listened to the candidate and I must tell you he made three proposals to combat terrorism. And as a European I could have hardly articulated better what Europe needs. Orban has accused the EU of weakness in the face of a what he sees as a fundamental threat from more than a million migrants who arrived on the continent last year, with hundreds of thousands following them this year. For the most part, the migrants are fleeing the war in Syria. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has called Orban Viktator - a pun on Viktor and dictator - as a way of putting down the Hungarians views. But Orban also has supporters. Slovak premier Robert Fico, joined Orbans court challenge of the EUs mandatory migrant resettlement quotas. Tapping into Trumps proposals to create the best intelligence-gathering organisation in the world, Orban said that Europe too needs to create a network of national intelligence agencies that ranks with the worlds best. He then took aim at some of his EU colleagues. The second thing, said this valiant American presidential candidate, is to abandon the policy of exporting democracy. I could not have said it more precisely. Orban said Western countries acted recklessly to remove the undemocratic but stable regimes in Libya, Syria and Iraq without guaranteeing stability in the aftermath, exposing Europe to a mass wave of migration. Worse, he said, instead of supporting the regimes that try to control the civil-war-torn countries in North Africa and the Middle East, Europe criticises them for democratic shortfalls. If we keep prioritising democracy over stability in regions where we are unlikely to succeed with that, we will create instability, not democracy. ",politicsNews,"July 23, 2016 ",1
Alaska's top court rejects parental notice for abortions,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - An Alaska law requiring doctors to notify the parents of girls under the age of 18 seeking an abortion violates the states constitution and cannot be enforced, the states top court ruled on Friday. The 4-1 decision marks a long-awaited victory for Planned Parenthood and other abortion-rights advocates in Alaska who argued the 2010 law violates the privacy of pregnant teens. It also comes on the heels of the U.S. Supreme Court decision to strike down a Texas abortion law imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities in the strongest endorsement of abortion rights in America in more than two decades. A womans right to abortion was established in the courts landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, but several states have tried to restrict access to abortion through their own laws.  In Alaska, Planned Parenthood and doctors argued that the notification law was particularly threatening to vulnerable teens who live in abusive homes. Justice Daniel Winfree, writing for the majority, said that the notification laws discriminatory barrier to those minors seeking to exercise their fundamental privacy right to terminate a pregnancy violates Alaskas equal protection guarantee. Another justice, Dana Fabe, in a concurring opinion, wrote that the Alaska Constitution permits a parental notification law, but not one that contains provisions that are among the most restrictive of any states notification laws. The office of Alaskas Attorney General did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Alaskas law required 48-hour advance notice to parents before a physician may terminate a minors pregnancy, though it allowed a minor to seek a judges permission to bypass the notice process and granted an exception for medical emergencies. The law took effect in 2010 after a Superior Court ruled that the state had an interest in promoting communication between a pregnant girl and her family. Christine Charbonneau, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest and the Hawaiian Islands, said in a statement that We all want teens to be safe - and the sad truth is that some teens live in dangerous homes and cant go to their parents.

Kaine's crime-busting past may hurt Clinton's outreach to blacks,"RICHMOND, Va. (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clintons pick of Tim Kaine as her vice presidential running mate could hamper her efforts to reach out to African-American voters because of Kaines past embrace of crime-fighting strategies that have driven up the U.S. prison population and are unpopular in the black community. The now-defunct Project Exile that Kaine backed was so unusual it was championed by Republicans and Democrats alike and by both the top U.S. gun lobby group and gun-control advocates. But the federal program launched in 1997 in Richmond, Virginia, was also criticized at the time as a racially biased initiative that condemned young black men to lengthy prison terms. Clinton has come under fire herself from black activists for her past support for tough-on-crime policies of the 1990s now blamed for a surge in U.S. prison population and heightened tensions between law enforcement and black communities. One of her fundraisers got disrupted earlier this year by activists who asked her to apologize for mass incarceration.  Clinton named Kaine as her running mate late on Friday, making what is considered a safe choice for her battle against Republican presidential rival Donald Trump. As Richmond mayor from 1998 to 2001, Kaine, 58, was a vocal supporter of Project Exile, crediting it with reducing the citys murder rate. Its goal was to literally live up to its name by making illegal gun possession a federal, not a state, crime, which allowed prosecutors to send convicted felons, most of them black, to a distant federal penitentiary for at least five years. Sam Sinyangwe, co-founder of Campaign Zero, a group focused on curtailing police violence, said Kaines choice could exacerbate Clintons problems rallying support of African-Americans, particularly younger people. To select somebody like (Kaine) is not a sign of good leadership potential in a president, Sinyangwe said. Nicole Lee, a civil-rights lawyer and activist in Washington, D.C. who is African-American, also expressed concern. Project Exile broke black families, she said. This is not a benign thing to be for. These measures were not used against white kids in the suburbs with guns, they were used against black kids in the cities. To defeat Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election, Clinton needs high turnout among blacks and other minority voters to offset Trumps popularity among white voters. During the 1990s, she supported tough-on-crime initiatives backed by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, but now vows to end the era of mass incarceration. Her campaign is trying to walk a political tightrope after the killings of two black men by police and the shooting deaths of police officers in Texas and Louisiana. She has offered support for the Black Lives Matter movement, while also strongly condemning the killings of police officers. Officials who were in Richmond during Kaines mayoral tenure believe the community, ravaged by the crack-cocaine epidemic and an escalating murder rate, had to take dramatic steps. Amy Dudley, a spokeswoman in Kaines Senate office, said the senator stood by the program, believing that it reduced gun violence. Jerry Oliver, the police chief at the time and an African-American, said the program focused on black communities out of necessity. We had to be where the problems were, he said.  The National Rifle Association, the nations biggest gun lobby, was an early proponent of Project Exile as was the gun-control advocacy group Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.  As Richmonds first white mayor in more than a decade, Kaine was widely credited for helping to bridge racial divisions in the city, but Project Exile drew fire from defense lawyers and community advocates who argued that the program unfairly targeted African-Americans. Kevin Ring, vice president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a Washington advocacy group lobbying against federal sentencing minimums, said that Kaine, like Clinton, will have to demonstrate to black voters that he has evolved on the issue.  There are some that will be bothered. There will be questions, Ring said. Kaine supports legislation that would roll back some mandatory minimum federal sentences and give judges more discretion, although his office says he still supports firm sentences for illegal gun possession. Kaines backing of Project Exile also makes him odd bedfellows with Trump, who has made law and order a central theme of his candidacy. Trump has called for the programs revival and his campaign website said it was tremendous. ",politicsNews,"July 23, 2016 ",1
Judge tentatively rejects bid to toss Trump University lawsuit,"SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday tentatively rejected Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps bid to dismiss a lawsuit by Trump University students who said they were defrauded through its real-estate seminars. U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel in San Diego told a hearing he would take under consideration arguments on both sides in the case and issue a written ruling in the coming weeks.  The 2013 lawsuit, one of three over the defunct Trump University venture, was filed on behalf of students who paid up to $35,000 to learn Trumps real estate investing secrets from his hand-picked instructors.  The plaintiffs have sought class-action status. The cases against Trump University have regularly cropped up during the presidential campaign. Trump was roundly criticized in May when he accused Curiel, who is of Mexican descent, of being biased against him because of the candidates pledge to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico.  Curiel, who was born in Indiana, is presiding over two of the cases, with one set for trial in late November. A separate lawsuit by New Yorks attorney general is pending in that state. Trumps lawyers say Curiel should toss the 2013 California lawsuit on the grounds that the New York real estate mogul, though personally involved in developing the concept and curriculum, relied on other executives to manage Trump University by the time the plaintiffs purchased their seminars. By 2007, his involvement was fairly minimal. He was not the person running this company. He founded it, he established it and he went off and let other people run it. Its like any other celebrity endorsement, Trump attorney Daniel Petrocelli said during the hearing. Trumps lawyers claim references in marketing materials to secrets, hand-picked instructors or university were mere sales puffery. According to the defense, there is no evidence Trump intended to defraud students. Lawyers for the students say the wealthy developer conducted the marketing for Trump University more than anyone else, starring in and approving promotional materials. They claim Trump University instructors were high-pressure sales people, not professors and adjunct professors as Trump touted, and that New York authorities told Trump back in 2005 to stop calling his unaccredited venture a university.  Somehow, belligerence trumps substance, plaintiffs attorney Jason Forge said. If we say it loud enough, forcefully enough, it becomes true. Well, it doesnt. Trump owned 92 percent of Trump University and had control over all major decisions, plaintiffs court papers say. ",politicsNews,"July 22, 2016 ",1
Obama signs into law opioid addiction bill to protect newborns,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Friday signed into law a measure that pledges greater efforts to protect drug-dependent newborns and assist their parents. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act also stresses drug treatment and overdose prevention to help stanch the nations heroin and opioid drug epidemic. Obama said in a statement that 78 Americans die from opioid overdose every day, and noted that the legislation included only modest steps to address the epidemic. I am deeply disappointed that Republicans failed to provide any real resources for those seeking addiction treatment to get the care that they need, Obama said.In fact, they blocked efforts by Democrats to include $920 million in treatment funding. The bill was passed nearly unanimously by both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Efforts to enforce provisions to protect newborns and help their parents come in response to a Reuters investigation last year titled Helpless & Hooked. The new law requires that the federal government and every state follow a 2003 law that was routinely ignored. That law called on states to require hospitals and social services to report, track and assist drug-dependent newborns and their families. Reuters found that no more than nine states were following that requirement. Most children born to addicted mothers, including many mothers who were taking prescribed methadone, were not being reported by hospitals as required by law. Often, that was because medical workers feared involving child protective services, as the existing law requires. When cases were reported to social services, Reuters found, efforts to protect the child and help the parents often were limited. The failures came at a cost. Reuters found more than 110 babies since 2010 died under preventable circumstances after being sent home to families ill-equipped to care for them. Experts said far more children have likely died but gone uncounted. The new law promises a non-punitive approach that includes safe care plans aimed at keeping newborns at home with their parents, who will receive additional help. This is a step forward for vulnerable babies who, due to an opioid dependency, will begin their lives facing enormous challenges, said Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, the ranking Democrat on the Senate subcommittee on children and families. Reuters initial reporting shined a light on a darkness that had enveloped far too many lives. There is much more work to do but this is a genuine step forward. Representative John Kline, a Minnesota Republican who chairs the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, which initiated the measure, said it will track state actions. These reforms are an important part of our broader efforts to combat the nations opioid epidemic and provide these vulnerable families a better chance at a brighter future, Kline said in a statement. In 2013, the latest year with nationwide hospital reporting, 27,315 babies were diagnosed with newborn drug withdrawal syndrome, a five-fold increase from a decade earlier. Reuters found that one drug-dependent baby was born on average every 19 minutes in the United States. Some suffer shaking, crying and feeding problems as they battle withdrawal. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the broader addiction law was no more than a half measure without more funding. Wyden has co-sponsored a measure setting aside money for substance abuse treatment for parents in danger of losing their children. It passed the House but stalled in the Senate. Jim Greenwood, a former Pennsylvania congressman who championed the 2003 law, said the deaths Reuters revealed represent a national disgrace and glaring failure at the federal, state and local level to implement Plans of Safe Care for infants. Greenwood, now president of a Washington, D.C.-based biotechnology group, applauded the new measure to improve the health and safety of these babies and their families. Stephen Patrick, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University and leading researcher on the condition, said the new law is good news but added: Wish there was funding that came with it.

Trump leaves some on Wall Street wary and confused," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump has said a lot of things that, were he a sitting U.S. president instead of a candidate for the job, could be expected to roil financial markets.  If investors were taking the Republican presidential nominee at his word, they would be selling shares of Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) and Ford Motor Co (F.N), and cashing out of Mexican equities - all targets of Trump threats of boycotts, barrier walls or import taxes. Investors betting on a Trump presidency would be buying shares of U.S. companies that dealt exclusively with domestic customers and suppliers.  Yet the Trump trade is not much in evidence on Wall Street, where some market strategists and investors told Reuters they find it difficult to position their portfolios for his possible presidency, in part because many of his proposals are contradictory or lack specific implementation details.  MORE BUSINESS COVERAGE: Ex-Goldman banker Gordon Dyal beefs up M&A boutique Amazon makes its debut in thestudent loan business More pain for U.S. crude Should Trump win the Nov. 8 election, some investors said, it is not clear how the New York businessman could push through policies that clash with mainstream Republican party views on free trade and low taxes.  The investment community in particular is having trouble figuring out what (Trump) is about, said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland.  They are not taking individual items as seriously as they would with other candidates, he said.  Traders said they will be watching Trumps speech at the Republican convention on Thursday night for signs of how he would address business and tax issues, though they expect scant detail.  The Trump campaign did not respond to calls and emails requesting comment on how investment strategists viewed his policies.  U.S. stock indexes have rallied to new highs as Trump received the nomination of his party on a platform that includes a proposal to reinstate the 1933 Glass-Steagall law that would require a breakup of the largest U.S. banks.  A Trump presidency would not be good for markets at all, because of the uncertainty among investors about his true priorities, said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies and solutions at Voya Investment Management in New York.  Zemsky, however, said he has not so far been selling securities because of Trump. Its hard to react to things that are said because of the lack of specificity, and the probability of him being elected is still low so changing your portfolio because of him is not likely to be profitable, he said.  To be sure, Trump has supporters on Wall Street. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital, has backed Trump and said he would be good for the economy because he would cut back on business-limiting regulations, such as those governing bank investments and labor policies. He also thinks Trump would bring in tax reform.  Although never elected to public office, Trump defeated 16 Republican rivals to win the nomination. He trails Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by 7 percentage points, narrowing the gap from 15 points late last week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday.  If Trumps stated proposals were carried out, that could leave the economy significantly weaker because they would result in large federal budget deficits and an anti-global stance that could hurt trade, according to a June analysis by Moodys Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi.  Zandi forecast the loss of 3.5 million jobs during a Trump administration alongside a drop in stock prices and real estate value.  Trump has said he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, build a wall between the United States and Mexico to stop illegal immigrants, and raise a 35 percent tariff on products made in Mexico by Ford and United Technologies Corps (UTX.N) Carrier Corp.  Yet there has been no selloff of Mexican stocks, which are up 10 percent so far in 2016. That is the best gauge of investment reaction to Trump, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.  For the most part, Ablin said, that suggests to me the investment community has not considered a Trump presidency a probable scenario at this point.  ",politicsNews,"July 21, 2016 ",1
Obama: dark Trump vision 'doesn't really jibe' with facts,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The dark vision of America under siege described by Donald Trump in his acceptance speech for the Republican presidential nomination does not mesh with reality, U.S. President Barack Obama said on Friday. Obama noted that the birds were chirping and the sun was out for most Americans after Trumps Thursday night speech, which expounded on the threats to America from illegal immigrants, Islamic State militants, and race-related violence. This idea that America is somehow on the verge of collapse, this vision of violence and chaos everywhere, doesnt really jibe with the experience of most people, Obama said at a White House news conference after meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. Obama said the violent crime rate in America has been lower during his 7-1/2 years in office than any time during the last three or four decades, despite an uptick in murders in some cities this year, and the recent high-profile killings of black men and police officers. The timing of Obamas quickly arranged short meeting with Pena Nieto presented both leaders with a convenient platform from which to criticize Trump. Just three weeks ago, Obama - who has six months left in the White House - invited the Mexican president to visit one last time before the U.S. president leaves on Jan. 20. Trump has pledged to build a wall at the Mexico border to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs, and to force Mexico to pay for it. The New York businessman has also promised to slap tariffs on some U.S. products made in Mexico, and seek radical changes or even discard the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Pena Nieto was first to mention Trump, but said he respected both Trump and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and would work with constructively and in good faith with whoever wins the Nov. 8 election. In March, Pena Nieto likened Trumps strident tone to the ascent of dictators Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. But he said on Friday that he had never pointed the finger at any of the candidates, saying that anything he had said had been taken out of context. And he stressed that the two nations futures were closely bound. The closeness between the United States and Mexico is more than a relationship between governments. Its a solid and unbreakable relationship between millions of people who live in both nations, Pena Nieto said. Obama said the rate of illegal immigration is down from past decades, and praised Mexico for helping to address a flood of migrants fleeing Central America and for work on drug trafficking. A Mexico that has a healthy economy, a Mexico that can help us build stability and security in Central America, thats going to do a lot more to solve any migration crisis or drug trafficking problem than a wall, Obama said. Obama and Pena Nieto praised the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal as addressing some of the criticisms of NAFTA. Both Trump and Clinton have said they oppose the TPP, which has yet to be ratified by the U.S. Congress. There are going to be different visions about where we should go as a country, Obama said, running down a list of economic issues facing the nation. But were not going to make good decisions based on fears that dont have a basis in fact, he said. ",politicsNews,"July 22, 2016 ",1
Former Ku Klux Klan leader Duke runs for U.S. Senate in Louisiana,"BATON ROUGE, La. (Reuters) - David Duke, a former leader of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan, launched his candidacy on Friday for the U.S. Senate from Louisiana, saying white people are threatened in America and that he hears echoes of his views in Donald Trumps rhetoric. Duke, a Republican, is a former Louisiana state legislator and unsuccessful candidate for governor who served a 15-month federal prison sentence after pleading guilty in 2002 to felony charges of tax evasion and mail fraud. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, drew criticism in February for failing to quickly disavow support from Duke. At a news conference in Baton Rouge after officially filing as a candidate to succeed outgoing Republican Senator David Vitter, Duke, 66, said he watched Trumps speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday in Cleveland and heard echoes of his own past political platforms. I dont really care what Donald Trump says about me. I respect what hes doing, Duke said. In an online video announcing his candidacy, Duke also said, Im overjoyed to see Donald Trump and most Americans embrace most of the issues that Ive championed for years. In his video, Duke said he believes in equal rights and respect for all Americans but what makes me different is I also demand respect for the rights and heritage of European-Americans. Dukes announcement came as Louisianas capital grapples with racial tensions after the fatal July 5 shooting by police of a black man named Alton Sterling and the July 17 shooting deaths of three police officers by a black U.S. Marine Corps veteran. In his comments to reporters, Duke called the Black Lives Matter protest movement that arose after a series of killings of black men by police in various U.S. cities a terrorist group. Duke said that European-Americans need a politician to fight for their interests and that white people are threatened in the United States. Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, said he was no longer affiliated with the group. HATE-FILLED FRAUD Dukes announcement drew and swift and scathing condemnation from Republican leaders and others. The Republican Party of Louisiana called Duke a felon and hate-filled fraud who does not embody Republican values. Ward Baker, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which supports Republican candidates in Senate races, said Duke will never get the organizations backing. Louisiana does not hold party primaries. Instead, candidates from all parties are placed on the same ballot. If no one wins a simple majority in the Nov. 8 election, the top two vote-getters enter a runoff. Duke used this system to his advantage when he ran for governor in 1991 and made it to a runoff against former Governor Edwin Edwards, who had left office under a cloud of controversy for misconduct in office. Other candidates seeking to replace Vitter in the Senate include Republican U.S. congressmen Charles Boustany and John Fleming. Vitter did not seek re-election to the Senate after a prostitution scandal helped derail his bid to become Louisiana governor. I strongly denounce the racism, bigotry and anti-Semitism of David Duke. His views are a relic of ancient history and are repugnant to Louisianians, Boustany said.  A spokesman for Fleming said the congressman is wholly focused on uniting Louisiana voters of all races, creeds and religions.  In February, Trump initially blamed his failure to reject Dukes support on not having heard an interviewer clearly.  I disavowed David Duke all weekend long, onFacebook, onTwitter, and obviously, it is never enough, Trump told NBCs Today show after being widely criticized. ",politicsNews,"July 22, 2016 ",1
"Trump accepts Republican nomination, vows to put 'America first'","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Donald Trump accused Democratic rival Hillary Clinton of a legacy of death, destruction, terrorism and weakness as U.S. secretary of state and vowed to be tough on crime and illegal immigrants in a speech on Thursday accepting the Republican presidential nomination. Trumps 75-minute speech was designed to set the tone for the general election campaign against Clinton, an answer to Republicans who say the best way he can unify the divided party is to detail why the Democrat should not be elected on Nov. 8. As the crowd chanted: Lock her up for her handling of U.S. foreign policy, Trump waved them off and said: Lets defeat her in November. Thousands of supporters who were gathered in the convention hall roared their approval.  When it was over, Trump was joined on stage by family members as balloons cascaded from above and confetti blew around the arena. A CNN snap poll of viewers of the speech said 57 percent had a very positive reaction to the address and 18 percent a somewhat positive reaction, while 24 percent said it had a negative effect. Social media sentiment toward Trump based on tweets that mentioned his name was slightly more negative than positive shortly after his speech.  The acceptance speech by Trump, 70, closed out a four-day convention that underscored his struggle to heal fissures in the Republican Party over his anti-illegal-immigrant rhetoric and concerns about his temperament. The event was boycotted by many big-name establishment Republicans, such as 2012 nominee Mitt Romney and members of the Bush family that gave the party its last two presidents. Trump presented a bleak view of America under siege from illegal immigrants, threatened by Islamic State militants, hindered by crumbling infrastructure and weakened by unfair trade deals and race-related violence. Accusing illegal immigrants of taking jobs from American citizens and committing crimes, Trump vowed to build a great border wall against the border-crossers. We will stop it, Trump said. Trump took positions in conflict with traditional Republican policies. He said he would avoid multinational trade deals but instead pursue agreements with individual countries. He would renegotiate the NAFTA trade accord linking the United States, Canada and Mexico. He would penalize companies that outsource jobs and then export their foreign-made products back into the United States. We will never sign bad trade deals, Trump thundered. America first! The New York businessman, who has never held elected office, filled his speech with some of the bravado he used to win the Republican nomination over 16 rivals, punctuating his rhetorical points by waving an index finger. I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves, Trump said. Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. In his speech, Trump portrayed himself as a fresh alternative to traditional politicians, willing to consider new approaches to vexing problems and help working-class people who may feel abandoned. Laying out his case against Clinton, he denounced nation-building policies that were actually put in place to some extent by George W. Bush, without mentioning by name the Republican president who launched wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Trump said policies pursued by Clinton in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria had made a bad situation worse. He blamed her for the rise of Islamic State militants and blasted her willingness to accept thousands of Syrian refugees. After 15 years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before. This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness, Trump said. Clinton senior adviser John Podesta dismissed the speech as painting a dark picture of an America in decline and called it a reminder that Trump is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the United States. John Weaver, a senior adviser to Ohio Republican Governor John Kasich, a former presidential rival to Trump, said in a tweet that Trump had delivered the saddest, darkest, most depressing acceptance speech in modern history.  Trump needed a strong performance on Thursday night to improve his chances of getting a boost in opinion polls as Democrats prepare for their own, more scripted convention next week in Philadelphia. In a contest that pits two politicians viewed as unfavorable by large segments of the American people, Trump also accused Clinton, 68, of being the puppet of big business, elite media and major donors who want to preserve the current political system. That is why Hillary Clintons message is that things will never change. My message is that things have to change  and they have to change right now, Trump said. Trump said he would speedily address the violence that has dominated headlines, such as the shooting deaths of five Dallas police officers earlier this month. He vowed to defeat the barbarians of ISIS, the acronym for Islamic State. I have a message for all of you: The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end. Beginning on Jan. 20, 2017, safety will be restored, Trump said. The next president takes office on Jan. 20. The prevailing narrative at the Cleveland convention has not been about Trumps positions, but dominated instead by the failure of he partys various factions to unite behind Trump. A series of distractions at the convention largely thwarted a bid by the Trump campaign to show him as a caring father and magnanimous business leader who would bring greater prosperity and safety to the United States.  But in the end, many of these points were made when Ivanka Trump, Trumps daughter, introduced her father. I have seen him fight for his family. I have seen him fight for his employees. I have seen him fight for his company and now I am seeing him fight for our country, she said. Trumps text of his speech, released by his campaign,  included extensive footnotes to show where the material originated. That was perhaps in reaction to the speech given on Monday night by Trumps wife Melania, who was accused of plagiarism when she repeated lines from a 2008 speech by Michelle Obama, Obamas wife. A staff writer for the Trump Organization later took responsibility for the misstep. ",politicsNews,"July 21, 2016 ",1
"Obama, after meeting Mexican leader, praises Mexico as critical partner","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Friday after meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto that Mexico is a critical partner to the United States on a host of issues, including security and climate change.

Undocumented immigrants given roles at Democratic convention,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Democratic Party has selected a handful of undocumented immigrants for official roles at next weeks Democratic National Convention, in a bid to highlight the gaping policy divide on immigration between White House hopeful Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump. Clinton is hoping to drive Latino voters to the polls on Nov. 8 to shore up her chances against Trump, who has campaigned on a promise to crack down on illegal immigration by building a wall along the Mexican border and deporting millions of undocumented foreigners if elected. Our nation is a nation of immigrants that believes in being inclusive, and thats exactly what we will continue to work toward, saidLeah Daughtry, the chief executive officer of the committee organizing the July 25-28 convention in Philadelphia. The voices of our nations brave undocumented youth will be heard loud and clear, Daughtry added. The picks include two members of the convention credentials and platform committees, as well as several speakers. The positions are unpaid, officials said. Trumps campaign, which has argued that unchecked immigration hurts American workers and undermines national security, criticized the move. Apparently speaking at Hillary Clintons convention is just one more job Hillary Clinton thinks Americans wont do, a Trump campaign aide said in an emailed statement. She should have instead invited unemployed Americans, or victims of crime, or law enforcement.  The selections are legal because of a deferred action program adopted by President Barack Obamas administration, which postpones deportations and provides work authorization for some immigrants brought to the United States as children. The Supreme Court blocked efforts to expand those protections last month. The nominations mark the first time a major U.S. political partys convention has featured so many undocumented workers among its ranks. While there was an undocumented speaker at the 2012 Democratic convention, the party has not previously tracked the immigration status of its committee members. It changes the whole conversation when you have someone directly affected at the table, said Cesar Vargas, a Mexican immigrant chosen for the partys policy platform committee.  Hareth Andrade, 23, an undocumented immigrant from Bolivia who was approved under a deferred action program, was picked for the credentials committee.The convention will also feature at least two undocumented immigrant speakers, Astrid Silva and Francisca Ortiz. Clinton already has overwhelming support from minorities. Some 70 percent back her, compared with 9 percent for Trump, according to recent Reuters/Ipsos polling, suggesting that she could have a strong chance in states like Florida, Nevada and Colorado that swing between voting Democratic and Republican in presidential elections.  However, voter turnout among Latinos has traditionally been low, hitting only about 40 percent in 2012, meaning her challenge is to get more of them to cast ballots this year. Luis Fraga, co-director of the Institute for Latino Studies at the University of Notre Dame, said showing a commitment to progressive reform of U.S. immigration policy could help Clinton do that.  He called immigration a gateway issue for minority voters that can help engage them. Thats especially so because even Latinos born in the United States are often not far removed from family members who are immigrants themselves.  Although its not their individual experience, it is their familys experience, Fraga said. ",politicsNews,"July 22, 2016 ",1
A divided Republican party: Donald or Ivanka for president?," CLEVELAND/NEW YORK (Reuters) - At times, the speech was drowned out by the cheering crowds in the arena of the Republican National Convention. Social media crowned a new political star. Some Republicans said they were seeing the U.S. president they longed for.  It was Ivanka Trumps night.  The eldest daughter of New York businessman-turned-presidential nominee Donald Trump almost stole the show on Thursday night with a speech about her father that roused a packed Cleveland convention hall, broadcast to millions.  READ OUR TOP STORIES: Verizon emerges as front-runner in Yahoo auction OPINION - Dumb money:How political mega-donors got it wrong Silicon Valley leads avalanche of quarterly reports On Google, there were more searches for Ivanka Trump than for her father.  The 34-year old businesswoman and former model talked about her fathers yearning to improve America, childcare, equal pay for women and other issues close to her heart, with a poise some found befitting of the White House.  Okay, why isnt @IvankaTrump running for President? television actor Anson Mount said in a Twitter post.  One of the best speeches - if not the best speech - tonight, said Chris Herrod, a 50-year-old delegate from Utah who had worked for Trumps vanquished rival Ted Cruz, the U.S. senator from Texas.  One of Trumps five children, Ivanka was chosen to introduce her father, who then officially accepted the Republican Partys presidential nomination. Since Trump announced his intention to run for the White House last year, she has been steadily drawn into her fathers presidential campaign along with her 35-year-old husband Jared Kushner.  The couple both take part in the Trump campaigns family meeting each Monday morning, helping make decisions about spending and strategy, according to a source familiar with the meetings.  Among the children, Ivanka is the one who is often the bridge to women voters and seems to have the mission of selling her fathers softer side. When she is not involved in the campaign, she helps to run the familys sprawling business empire from its New York City headquarters.  This week in Cleveland she has been everywhere, lobbying for her father with delegates and donors, appearing in television interviews and leaving a trail of picture-taking fans in her wake. One man, a Republican delegate in Cleveland, carried a placard all week around the convention that read: Ivanka, 2024. First Female President.  Her star turn in Cleveland was one of the top trending topics on Twitter late on Thursday, with about 121 tweets mentioning her name posted every minute. Overall sentiment on her was more positive than negative by a ratio of 3 to 1, according to analytics firm Zoomph.  Ivanka missed her one chance to date to vote for her father: she had not changed her party registration from Democrat to Republican in time to cast a ballot in the April 19 New York primary election.  She more than compensated on Thursday night, some convention delegates said.  She gave us enormous insight into him and the kind of man he is, said retiree Fernando C. deBaca, a 78-year-old New Mexico delegate. Shes (an) enormously capable young lady, as is her brother. Were going to see the beginning of a dynasty here.  ",politicsNews,"July 22, 2016 ",1
"To wonks hungry for policy details, Trump team serves lighter fare","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - People seeking a deeper understanding of Donald Trumps economic policy came up empty-handed this week at the Republican National Convention. Best known to Americans previously as a reality TV host and having never held public office, the New York businessman on Thursday accepted the partys nomination for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. The party establishment has fretted over some of his plans to curb illegal immigration, renegotiate trade deals and levy tariffs on China. Trumps skepticism about free trade puts him at odds with Republican orthodoxy. Wall Street investors are wary and confused. In speeches from the main stage and in panel discussions on the sidelines, the four-day convention was notable for a paucity of policy details, the result perhaps of a desire to play down differences among the party faithful. The lack of specifics was too much for one head of a multinational corporation, who complained at a business forum that he had no idea what to expect from Trump, a New York real estate developer.  We feel anxious, said Michael Thaman, chief executive officer of Owens Corning, which operates in 25 countries. In business, obviously details matter. Trump offered little insight himself in his convention-ending acceptance speech. He spoke in broad, thematic strokes without much detail, sticking closely to positions he had outlined during 13 months of campaigning. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo, Trump said. Speakers in Cleveland placed a greater emphasis on defeating the presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, than on what Trump has called the failed economic policies of President Barack Obama. On Tuesday night, when the theme was Make America Work Again and the economy was the designated topic, a rough search by Reuters of the prime-time speeches found some 80 mentions of the word Clinton compared to about 15 mentions of economy. According to transcripts of the speeches delivered at the convention, only Trumps son Donald Trump Jr. mentioned Dodd-Frank, the financial oversight law many Republicans rail against.  Asked on Thursday, before the older Trumps speech, about the shortage of policy specifics, his campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said:  The campaign is pleased with the convention program, the content of which has been diverse and dynamic and we look forward to an exciting conclusion tonight. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was chief economic policy adviser to Republican presidential nominee John McCain in 2008, was not satisfied with his experience. He described taking part in a panel discussion on Wednesday with two Trump advisers, television commentator Larry Kudlow and Steve Moore of the conservative Heritage Foundation, that he said was light on details. Isnt Mr. Trump bad on trade? he said someone would ask.  Yes, but were going to fix it. Dont worry. Isnt his tax plan a problem thats going to lose $12 trillion?  Yes, but well fix it. Dont worry. Kudlow and Moore also appeared on Tuesday at an event hosted by conservative advocacy group FreedomWorks, along with donor Andy Puzder, the chief executive of CKE Restaurants, which owns fast-food restaurants Hardees and Carls Jr. The group discussed trade and immigration policy, with panelists at times shrugging off Trumps lack of specifics. All you really need to know is the alternative is Hillary Clinton, Puzder said at one point, reinforcing the weeks theme.  Republicans typically use their nominating conventions to emphasize their candidates main policy points. Think tanks and lobby groups hold panel discussions. Experts circulate white papers.  With Trump, the events were built more around his personality and the need for the party to unite behind him.    There were some such gatherings in Cleveland, but fewer than usual, Holtz-Eakin said. Some advisers to past Republican candidates suspected Trump was not relying on a vast team of policy advisers.  Lanhee Chen, an adviser to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, sorted through convention speeches in 2012 before speakers delivered them because, he said, he wanted to make sure they hewed closely to Romneys positions. I imagine the Trump campaign doesnt have that process in place because they dont have a lot of policy to talk about, Chen said. It just says that policy hasnt been a priority for them. You end up with a situation where the candidate is making pronouncements that dont seem particularly well informed. Some delegates who spoke to Reuters seemed unconcerned by the policy-light approach to the convention, arguing that it was more important for the gathering to whip up enthusiasm among the delegates and forge unity. This is more of a party, said Ray Suttle, a 53-year-old lawyer and delegate from Virginia. You dont like people talking shop at a cocktail party, do you? ",politicsNews,"July 22, 2016 ",1
"Clinton faces pressure to pick VP who is tough on trade, Wall Street","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Members of the Democratic Partys liberal wing on Thursday nervously awaited Hillary Clintons announcement in coming days of a vice presidential running mate, urging her to choose someone who opposes a massive Pacific free trade deal and backs tough Wall Street reform. Two U.S. senators, Tim Kaine and Cory Booker, and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack were among the contenders, according to a Democratic source with knowledge of the discussions. After promising to oppose the TPP, its important for Clinton to pick someone who shares that position, said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee The Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade deal, known as TPP, became a key issue during the primary season, with critics contending that it would be unfair to American workers. Clintons chief rival for the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has headed the effort on the U.S. left to oppose the TPP and trade deals like it. The Democratic source said that while Clintons decision was being closely held, there were vibes she may be leaning toward Kaine as a partner to take on Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his vice presidential running mate Mike Pence in the Nov. 8 election. But the source said that the consideration of Vilsack, a former governor of Iowa, is real, even if Kaine, a senator from Virginia who is also a former governor of the state, might have an edge. Clinton wants somebody who will be a reliable partner she can trust and make the policy decisions and potentially step into the presidency, the source said, adding that Clinton sees Kaine as someone who would fit that bill. Hispanic-Americans, meanwhile, continued to push for a first-ever Latino on the Democratic ticket. For our members that kind of a message would certainly resonate, said Yvanna Cancela, political director for the Culinary Workers Union in Las Vegas. It is way past the time for when we have a Latino in one of the highest offices in the country. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro had both been mentioned. Others have also come under consideration. The source added that U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a favorite of the partys liberal wing and a fierce critic of Wall Street, received close consideration by Clinton but would not provide the right balance for the ticket. Others have also been under consideration in recent days, including Booker, to see if they hit a surprise chord with Clinton, the source said. Booker, an African-American, is a first-term senator and a former mayor of Newark, New Jersey. Both Kaine and Vilsack have backed free-trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiation by the Obama administration, encompassing about 40 percent of the worlds economies stretching from Japan to Chile. Critics include Trump as well as Sanders. Clinton herself has distanced herself from the trade deal.  Taylor said that it is also important she pick someone committed to strong Wall Street reform, saying that the wrong pick could hamper Democrats drive to keep Trump from winning the White House. Booker traveled to Cleveland to defend the Clinton campaign, which has come under continued attack at the Republican convention there this week. The vile and the viciousness, it doesnt reflect who we are as a country, Booker said of the Republican convention, in an interviewed with MSNBC. Asked about his appearance Thursday on Clintons official Instagram account, Booker said it should not be read as tea leaves about a potential vice presidential pick.  You have a social media-minded person and I understand this platform, he said.  The Democratic source knowledgeable about the process said Clinton could announce her running mate as early as Friday in Florida. She will campaign there in the run-up to next weeks Democratic convention in Philadelphia, where Clinton is expected to be formally nominated. Another Democratic source said Clinton might wait until Saturday to help keep the media focused on the Republican convention in Cleveland, where opposing wings of that party were in open warfare.  Television interviewer Charlie Rose, speaking with Clinton recently, noted that some view Kaine as boring. Clinton responded, I love that about him. Susie Tompkins Buell, a founder of the Esprit fashion label and close friend of Clinton, on Thursday would not comment on who might be the choice. But Buell, a major donor to Clintons campaign, said the person would be a high contrast to Trumps choice of Pence. ",politicsNews,"July 21, 2016 ",1
Trump NATO plan would be sharp break with decades-long U.S. policy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican foreign policy veterans and outside experts warned that the suggestion by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump that he might abandon NATOs pledge to automatically defend all alliance members could destroy an organization that has helped keep the peace for 66 years and could invite Russian aggression. Statements like these make the world more dangerous and the United States less safe, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Trump critic who is one of the Republican Partys leading foreign policy voices and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement on Thursday. I can only imagine how our allies in NATO, particularly the Baltic states, must feel after reading these comments from Mr. Trump. Im 100 percent certain how Russian President Putin feels  hes a very happy man, he said.Trumps comments in a New York Times interview would seem to put him on the same page with Mr. Putin, Richard Armitage, who was deputy secretary of state in the George W. Bush administration, said in an interview with Reuters. In the New York Times interview, Trump, in response to a question about potential Russian aggression toward the Baltic states - Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - said that if Moscow attacked them, he would decide whether to come to their aid only after reviewing whether those nations have fulfilled their obligations to us. He added, If they fulfill their obligations to us, the answer is yes. Its the end of NATO, Robert Hunter, a former U.S. ambassador to the alliance under President Bill Clinton, told Reuters. The essence of NATO, more than any other single factor, is the commitment of the United States of America to the security of the other 27 members. Asked about Trumps comments, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the EU knows it needs to work more on our defense capabilities, but said the United States needs to keep solidarity with its allies. Its very simple to realize that in the world of today, which is quite a complicated one and quite a dangerous one, you need friends, said Mogherini, who spoke in Washington at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. A letter signed by a bipartisan group of 39 national security experts said Trumps inflammatory remarks do not represent the interests of the United States. The strength of our alliances is at the core of those interests, said the group, which includes prominent Republicans such as former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and former State Department official Eliot Cohen. The United States must uphold the North Atlantic Treaty Organizations commitments to all of our allies, including Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the letter said. U.S. Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the mutual defense commitment was the essence of the Atlantic alliance. But he added that both Republicans and Democrats are becoming exasperated that most members of the alliance are not honoring their obligations for military spending, Corker, a Tennessee Republican, said in a statement. Responding to Trumps suggestion that his decisions would depend in part on whether states that were attacked were meeting their financial commitments to the alliance, former diplomat Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said it is important not to see NATO or any alliance solely in budget terms. More important is the net benefit the U.S. derives from the stability and security of the country and region affected and the price the U.S. would pay if stability were to be lost or its interests undermined, Haass told Reuters. Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, which created NATO in 1949 and calls an attack on one member an attack on all, has been invoked once - to help defend the United States after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Following the attacks, NATO sent AWACS planes to patrol over U.S. skies, with more than 800 crew members from 13 NATO countries flying over 360 sorties. As part of the eight measures approved to support the United States, NATO, about three weeks later, sent elements of its Standing Naval Forces to patrol the Eastern Mediterranean and monitor shipping, expanding that to include the entire Mediterranean several months later. A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also noted that the alliance deployed a third of the troops in Afghanistan for over a decade, where over one thousand soldiers from non-U.S. NATO allies and partners gave their lives. Still, some experts downplayed Trumps comments, even as they criticized them. Kurt Volker, who was U.S. ambassador to NATO under both Republican President George W. Bush and Democratic President Barack Obama, said it was inadvisable to create doubts in adversaries minds about the consequences they would face if they invaded a country. Putin loves it, Volker said. But he said the general European attitude was to take Trumps pronouncements with a grain of salt. Everyone knows its an election campaign, he said.

"As Republicans anoint Trump, party grapples with identity crisis","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - On the floor and corridors of the basketball arena hosting the Republican National Convention, in restaurants and bars, hotel lobbies and conference rooms across Cleveland, the talk was of the rise of Donald Trump, whose unlikely presidential candidacy has caused seismic fractures in the Republican Party. While the venues changed, the question didnt: Where do we go from here? This was the week that Trump was officially nominated as the Republicans 2016 presidential candidate and was effectively given control of a party whose leaders have criticized him for his incendiary rhetoric, personal attacks on fellow Republicans, and tendency to stray from decades-old party orthodoxy.  He packed the convention hall with his grassroots army of supporters, who seemed almost completely disinterested in his policy positions, even though they could reshape the party for years to come on core issues like trade, immigration and foreign policy. Those who were interested - party veterans, lawmakers, donors and lobbyists - found little clarity in any of the speeches delivered from the convention stage or in conversations with members of the Trump campaign. Are we still a party that embraces free trade and free markets, they asked. Are we still committed to ending abortion rights? Do we want to create a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants or ship all of them out of the country? Paul Ryan, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and the most powerful elected Republican, acknowledged that Trump has transformed his party. But he hedged on whether he believes Trumps impact will be lasting or simply a temporary phenomenon that will dissipate if he loses on Nov. 8.  I dont know the answer to that question. I really have no idea, Ryan said at an event in Cleveland. Trump had changed the party, he said, but how specifically and in what direction, I dont know.  Even after two days of speeches, Utah delegate Matt Throckmorton was still trying to figure out what a Trump presidency would mean for the Republican Party. What happens next? asked Throckmorton. In many way the uncertainty about Trump reflects the conflict within the Republican electorate. The party has struggled to find consensus on a number of key issues, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling during the 2016 campaign season. For example, when asked in March about international trade, the same number of Republicans said it creates jobs as said it causes job losses. When asked about abortion in June, the number of Republicans who wanted it to be illegal in all cases was matched by those who wanted it to be legal in most cases.  Trump had his biggest stage on Thursday night, when he officially accepted the partys nomination, to spell out his vision of where he would take the Republican Party if he won the presidency. But his speech, rich in rhetoric, offered scant detail beyond sweeping promises to put America first. If this Trump speech - and this GOP platform -  defines what a Republican is today, then its hard to say Im one. Hard for a lot of us, tweeted Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman under President George W Bush.  A week earlier, Republican activists were celebrating the adoption of a deeply conservative political platform that condemned gay marriage and opposed abortion with no exceptions, among other things. Trumps lineup of speakers at the convention this week barely referenced it.  Its a little bit frightening, said Chris Herrod, another Utah delegate, explaining that the platform was one of the main ways delegates could help shape party policy. And he seems to have an attitude of just completely disregarding it.  Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump was the future of the Republican Party. Away from the floor, some anti-Trump Republicans were quietly debating whether it would be better in the long-term interests of the party to lose the White House in November. This week were having some real anguished discussions, said Vin Weber, a former congressman from Minnesota. People are falling in line with Trump, Weber said, but what does this party believe? Take trade, for example. Republicans have long been the party of free trade, but Trump has said current trade deals have impoverished American workers and wants to renegotiate them or in some cases block them altogether, like President Barack Obamas signature Trans-Pacific Partnership. Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker and a close Trump ally, worked to ease fears that a Trump administration would derail the U.S. economy by scrapping trade alliances. He has no interest in breaking up the world market, Gingrich told a group of diplomats, adding that Trump was, in fact, committed to free trade with some added protections for American companies.  Now how Trump will work this out, I have no idea, Gingrich added. Some attendees at the convention expressed the hope that Trump would align himself with many of their cherished conservative values but admitted they just didnt know what he would do once he was in office. They would have found little solace in Gingrichs remarks to the diplomats. You will not know what hes doing every morning, because he will not know what hes doing every morning, Gingrich told them, suggesting a Trump presidency would be similar to his candidacy - reactive, spontaneous and centered almost entirely around Trumps instincts. But Trumps instincts are sometimes at odds with key elements of the party. For example, he has been more accepting of gay rights and has see-sawed on abortion rights, first defending them and then saying he opposes abortion.  Conservatives are prepared to believe Trump might be wrong 20, 25, maybe 30 percent of the time, Richard Viguerie, a veteran Republican activist, told Reuters at an anti-abortion event. But, Trumps opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, will be wrong 100 percent of the time. Asked if Trump supported the conservative social values espoused in the platform, he laughed. Well, I dont know, he said. Well have to wait and see. Some lawmakers at the convention dismissed some of Trumps most provocative proposals, like his vow to deport an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants, as unlikely to be implemented.  Full-blown deportation is not going to sell politically and I dont think a Republican Congress, or any Congress, would stand by and watch it happen, Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma told a group of convention attendees.   Some Republicans believe should Trump lose, the party will simply return to its more traditional conservative principles.  The Republican Party is bigger than any one candidate, even a presidential candidate, said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. But Trump supporters said those Republicans were in denial and that Trump had permanently wrested control of the party away from the establishment elites.  Wheres Mitt Romney, where are the Bushes? said Mary Lou McCoy, who had traveled to Cleveland from Buffalo, New York, referring to the 2012 Republican nominee and the Bush political dynasty. The people have spoken. ",politicsNews,"July 22, 2016 ",1
"Glitzy parties, bowling: Scenes from the other Republican convention","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Bourbonflowed, a jazz band played, and pink and violet lights bathed the vaulted stone ceilings at a party thrown by a liquor producers lobby group on Mondayfor attendees of the Republican National Convention. Seven blocks away in Cleveland, in the arena where Donald Trump was to officially accept his partys nod for the White House, a fight boiled over between Trump supporters and foes about the rules concerning his nomination. Delegates shouted at each other. The chairman tasked with keeping order briefly abandoned the podium. Microphones went dead. Typically, the Republican convention that takes place every four years is a tale of two conventions. At the official one, activists from all 50 states come to hear testimonials about their partys presidential nominee and watch the candidates official coronation. At the other, Republicans in the professional class - strategists, lobbyists, pollsters, lawmakers - rub elbows at cocktail hours and concerts, woo donors at power breakfasts and toss back booze at night, all the while conducting informal business, swapping pledges of support and plans for the future. This year, the disconnect between the two conventions seemed more pronounced, several lobbyists and activists said, and some parties were more subdued. The Distilled Spirits Councils soiree, normally a jam-packed affair, drew a more modest crowd this year, according to some Republicans who have attended it at past conventions. The councils senior vice president, Frank Coleman, pooh-poohed the idea that attendance was down. It was a very large venue, he said, saying that the party still attracted about 700 people over the course of the evening. Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said there was a muted tone at some Cleveland gatherings, which he attributed to the unique relationship between Trump and his partys establishment. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate and a former Massachusetts governor, and Senator John McCain, the partys 2008 nominee, hailed from the establishment and had extensive ties with businesspeople and strategists who are convention regulars. By contrast, Trump, a real estate developer and former reality TV star who has never held elective office, clinched the Republican nomination by touting his outsider status. You have a non-politician, a Hollywood entertainer trying to show Americans hes fit for office, and you have Republicans who are used to coming to these things for years, Bonjean said. The two groups, he said, werent mixing so smoothly. Inside the convention arena on Thursday evening, Trump fans cheered, danced to a band and roared support for a succession of speakers as they awaited the events finale - Trumps speech formally accepting the nomination.But in bars and parties nearby, there was hardly any clapping and cheering as those same scenes flashed across televisions. Some Republicans flew in to Cleveland for only for a day or two, to host events for lawmakers and clients, then left before TrumpsThursdaynight speech. One lobbyist for a large industrial conglomerate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, had a mission in Cleveland that had little to do with Trump: mingling with congressional Republicans and showing support for their re-election efforts. The informal convention did still take place, although more subdued. One strategist skipped a night of speeches and pageantry to gamble at a nearby casino. He won $8,000. A group of three made quick glances at a TV screen as Trumps wife, Melania, spoke on Monday night, checking on her progress between turns at a bar with bowling lanes that had been converted to a private lounge. But there were constant reminders that Cleveland was different. As an outsider, Trump lacks the kind of donor network that is typical of major party candidates and only recently has begun to ramp up his fundraising. Before the convention started, companies that habitually donate to the RNC withheld pledges or withdrew them, leading organizers to ask casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, a generous party benefactor, for an urgent donation. A strategist who asked for help to raise a last-minute $15,000 to sponsor food and drinks at a country music concert for delegates could not find any corporate donors willing to pony up. Eight of the 12 people he contacted said they were skipping the convention entirely. On Tuesday, Trump passed up a chance to forge closer ties with more big donors when he failed to appearat a breakfast  held on the field of the new football stadium in town, according to a report in Time magazine. Later that day, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie met with donors to brief them on plans for a team that would ease Trump into office if he wins the Nov. 8 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Such gatherings often attract billionaires and other moneyed luminaries. A man in charge of fundraising surveyed attendees in the modestly sized conference room and declared, I think I see about $600,000 in here. ",politicsNews,"July 22, 2016 ",1
"They held a convention in Cleveland, and (so far) few protesters came","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Kirtland Park, on the shores of Lake Erie near downtown Cleveland, was designated as a place where hundreds of protesters could camp during the Republican National Convention. It is less than a quarter full. One measure of the shortfall: With about 10 transportable toilets on hand Tuesday night and about 15 tents, the city was providing one plastic commode for every two campers.  U.S. political conventions typically are protest magnets, and the Republican National Convention that nominated Donald Trump as its presidential candidate after a bitter primary campaign had been seen as a major draw. But three days in, the crowds were far smaller than expected.  Activists said deadly attacks on police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Dallas had scared off some would-be protesters. Others saw the presence of open carry gun-rights advocates as a threat to their safety. Clevelands heavy police presence discouraged others, protest leaders said. Im extremely disappointed with turnout, said Lee Garnett, a 39-year-old tech worker who came from San Francisco to protest Trumps nomination. As he stood in Kirtland Park on Tuesday night, about two dozen activists listened to a man strum a guitar and sing. Garnett said friends had backed out. It was fear of violence. Fear of violence from the police and fear of violence from the Trump supporters, he said, citing Trumps prediction in March of riots if he were denied the nomination.  City records show three of five officially permitted protests planned for the first three days of the convention did not occur. Either organizers canceled events or supporters failed to take part, city officials said.  The American Civil Liberties Union had won a court battle to reduce the size of the security area around the convention hall, arguing that people needed more space to exercise their free speech rights. But the designated 1.7-square-mile (440-hectare) event zone easily accommodated the few hundred protesters on hand at any given time. At rallies, police officers appeared swiftly and often outnumbered the protesters. On Wednesday, police arrested 18 people - the biggest number of the convention so far - after they scuffled with police while trying to set fire to an American flag near the convention entrance. Cleveland has put 500 police officers on the streets, backed by about 3,000 reinforcements from as far away as California and Texas. Hundreds of cops on bicycles, with others on foot and horseback, have directed and controlled crowds.  It has a chilling effect on the exercise of free speech, which is so critical in a democratic society, said Terry Gilbert, a veteran Cleveland civil rights lawyer. Thats dangerous. I think that could change the whole dynamic of protest. Cleveland police say the events have gone smoothly so far, with little violence and only 23 convention-related arrests through Wednesday. Cleveland activist Art McCoy, founder of civil rights group Black Mans Army, which often protests against police use of force, said his group is not marching. Weve decided to be still and observe, McCoy said, adding that he doubted convention protests would change relations between minorities and local police. The convention is just a distraction. Local activist Rachelle Smith said the Dallas shooting, in which five people were killed, influenced her choice to act as a legal observer and adviser rather than leading protests. I expected numbers to be bigger  whether from people coming in from out of town or people from Cleveland getting involved, she said. But Christine Link, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, said Clevelanders have little experience assembling large-scale protests.  Cleveland is not Chicago or New York, she said. We dont have the activist networks, we dont have the populations of those cities. Ann Wright, 70, a member of the antiwar group Code Pink who  traveled from Honolulu, said the same fear that caused some to stay home prompted her to travel to Cleveland.  People who have privilege - Im a white woman, Im a retired lieutenant colonel - have to do this because we can, said Wright, a former U.S. Army officer and former U.S. diplomat. Protest organizers were not giving up. On Wednesday, a group of immigrant-rights activists donned ponchos with a brick pattern and stood shoulder to shoulder in what they called a human wall. Trump has promised to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Its a beautiful sight, Ivan Vargas, a 28-year-old business consultant from Atlanta, said as the march kicked off. These are people who are ready to put their bodies on the line.  At the end of the event, piles of unworn ponchos remained on the ground. ",politicsNews,"July 21, 2016 ",1
Pentagon revises law of war manual after criticism of press treatment,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon on Friday updated its law of war manual after a previous version came under fire for appearing to allow commanders to treat journalists as belligerents or spies. The U.S. Department of Defense manual, the first and most comprehensive of its kind, was first released last June. It compared some of the tasks of journalism to spying or other hostile actions by an enemy. The manual said some journalists may be considered unprivileged belligerents  a legal category with fewer protections than combatants, such as prisoner-of-war status. Reporting on military operations can be very similar to collecting intelligence or even spying, one passage of the manual said. Press freedom advocates said the manuals wording blurred the line between journalists and combatants and gave commanders the authority to detain reporters without charge. They also warned that it would erode U.S. credibility abroad at a time when journalists are being targeted by governments and militant groups. Sixty-nine journalists were killed for their work in 2015, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, up from 61 in 2014. In 2015, 199 journalists were being detained worldwide, compared to 221 in 2014. After the manuals release last year, news organizations including Reuters met with Pentagon officials to protest the language and ask for changes.  The revised manual provides greater detail on the legitimate purposes that journalists serve and makes clear that journalists have all the rights of civilians. Press freedom groups, including CPJ and Reporters Without Borders, praised the revisions. Advocates said the new manual acknowledged journalists right to interview enemy combatants and placed the onus on commanders to discern between the actions of reporters and combatants. These are major changes, said Frank Smyth of the CPJ. This affirms the rights and the practice of open and independent reporting on the battlefield. The Pentagon eliminated the passages comparing reporting to spying or hostile acts, but gives specific examples of how an act of reporting could result in the loss of civilian status. Journalists could still be considered unprivileged belligerents, the manual states, if they were a member of a non-state armed group and were carrying out propaganda or other media activities. Journalists could also lose their civilian status in certain cases, such as relaying target coordinates for an artillery strike against opposing forces, the manual said.  The new manual also eliminates language that called for journalists to seek permission from relevant authorities for their work to avoid being mistaken for spies. That passage drew criticism for setting an unrealistic standard for war reporting, in which frontlines can shift quickly. To cover conflicts in Libya or Syria, for instance, reporters often have to cross borders illegally. Pentagon officials also said they would be willing to revise the manual again if needed. The departments mission is to defend the very freedoms that journalists exercise, the Pentagons top lawyer, Jennifer OConnor, said in a statement. We have learned a lot during this process, and the department and the manual are better off for the experience. ",politicsNews,"July 22, 2016 ",1
Peter Thiel tells Republican convention he is 'proud to be gay',"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, the only big-name supporter of Donald Trump from the countrys technology hub, spoke on Thursday at the Republican National Convention to urge the country to discard petty cultural battles and turn its attention to solving the United States economic decline. Thiel offered a full-throated endorsement of Trump, echoing the Republican candidates themes of economic decline while  lambasting economic and foreign policies that have allowed the country to get embroiled in stupid wars. Our nuclear bases still use floppy disks. Our newest fighter jets cant even fly in the rain, Thiel said on the final evening of the four-day convention in Cleveland. Instead of going to Mars, we have invaded the Middle East. A co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook Inc  who sits on that companys board of directors, Thiel is well-known for contrarian and even eccentric views: a Libertarian who supports gay rights and legalizing marijuana, and who has proposed floating cities beyond the governments reach while encouraging students to drop out of college and start companies. His support of Trump has been both a source of curiosity and the butt of jokes in Silicon Valley, where Trumps anti-immigrant, anti-trade positions are regarded with horror. Many tech executives lean Democratic, and prominent Republican tech executives such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman have also rejected Trump. Thiel, who is gay, was expected to address gay rights in front of a political party whose platform rejects gay marriage and gay rights in general. He stopped short of such an appeal, however, addressing his sexuality only when saying: I am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. But most of all, I am proud to be an American. He is only the second openly gay man to address the Republican National Convention, CNN reported. When I was a kid, the great debate was about how to defeat the Soviet Union, and we won, Thiel said. Now we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom. This is a distraction from our real problems. Who cares? Thiel said his support for Trump was based on the belief that the candidate could address the countrys economic decline. He cited the space program and other government technology achievements as examples of what has been lost. Thiel drew parallels between himself and Trump each as a builder. His family emigrated from Germany when Thiel was one year old, and arrived in Cleveland - the city hosting this weeks convention. When Thiel pointed that out, he got loud applause. Back then, Thiel said, Opportunity was everywhere. In 1968, the worlds high-tech capital wasnt just one city. All of America was high-tech. ",politicsNews,"July 22, 2016 ",1
White House calls for Malaysian transparency in wake of fund scandal,"WASHINGTON/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The White House urged Malaysia on Thursday to demonstrate good governance and a transparent business climate, a day after U.S. prosecutors sued to try and seize $1 billion in assets they said were bought with money stolen from a state development fund. The civil lawsuits present a potentially thorny issue for the two countries that have grown closer during the administration of President Barack Obama, who has visited the southeast Asian nation twice in the last two years. The lawsuits will likely affect relations, but they did not come as a surprise, said a U.S. congressional aide. It has been a concern of a lot of people for a long time. Corruption in Malaysia is a huge problem, the aide said. No criminal charges have been filed in the scandal surrounding Malaysias 1MDB sovereign wealth fund, which was overseen by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. Obama spoke generally with Najib on a visit to Malaysia last year about the need for transparency and good governance, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at a news briefing. For business interests who are considering doing business in Malaysia, theyre going to be looking for signs that there is good business climate, Earnest told reporters. The Malaysian government should be conspicuous about making clear that theyre committed to transparency and good governance, and the kind of rules that will encourage people who are considering investing in Malaysias fast-growing economy to have confidence that they can do so fairly, Earnest said. Najib said in response to the lawsuits that his government would give its full cooperation to international investigations of the 1MDB case. Malaysias foreign minister Anifah Aman met the U.S. Ambassador to Malaysia Joseph Yun on Thursday to discuss the lawsuits. Malaysia highly values its bilateral relations with the United States and calls on the U.S. to recognize the various steps taken by the Government of Malaysia to address the 1MDB issue, the ministry said in a statement on Thursday night. Malaysias Attorney-General Mohamed Apandi Ali, however, expressed strong concerns at the insinuations and allegations of wrongdoing against Najib in the lawsuits.  He said in a statement that none of the probes conducted by law enforcement agencies across the globe over the past year show that any funds were misappropriated from 1MDB. The U.S. investigation is the largest set of cases brought by the Justice Departments Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, which seeks the forfeiture of the proceeds of foreign corruption. Targeting assets ranging from valuable paintings and a private jet to the 2013 hit movie The Wolf of Wall Street and rights to popular songs, the civil lawsuits said $3.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB. 1MDB said in a statement that it was not a party to the lawsuit, did not have any assets in the United States, nor has it benefited from the various transactions described.

"Trump warns he could end NATO guarantee, scrap NAFTA","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he might abandon NATOs guarantee of mutual defense and would renegotiate or scrap the NAFTA trade deal if he is elected, drawing fire from some senior Republicans and his Democratic rival. In response to a question about potential Russian aggression against the Baltic states, Trump told the New York Times that  Washington would help defend other NATO members only if they had fulfilled their obligations to us.  All three Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, are former Soviet republics and now NATO members. Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort did not dispute the quotes, saying they were consistent with the candidates desire to modernize the United States international treaties.  But national security officials and some Republicans said abandoning NATOs mutual defense guarantee, enshrined in  Article 5 of the treaty, would abandon 66 years of U.S. foreign policy and threaten the worlds most powerful military alliance. Also weighing in was the campaign for Democrat Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and Trumps likely opponent in the Nov. 8 election. Trump has apparently decided that America lacks the moral authority to advance our interests and values around the world, Clintons senior foreign policy adviser, Jake Sullivan, said in a statement.      Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told CNN he disagreed totally with Trumps comments on NATO. Its the most important military alliance in world history. It remains relevant today. Many Americans dont know that the operation in Afghanistan is a NATO operation, McConnell said, adding: I want to reassure our NATO allies that we will come to the defense of any member that is threatened. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a former presidential rival of Trump, said Trumps remarks made the world more dangerous and the United States less safe. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday he would not interfere in the U.S. election campaign but that allied solidarity was a key value for the group. This is good for European security and good for U.S. security, the NATO head said in a statement. The United States has always stood by its European allies. Trump previously said he would force allies to shoulder more of the defense costs that the United States has borne for decades, cancel long-standing treaties he considers unfavorable, and redefine what it means to be a partner of the United States.Stoltenberg said defense spending among European allies and Canada rose last year for the first time in many years. In 2016, he said, he expected a further 3 percent increase, or $8 billion. TRADE DISPUTESTrump has railed against the NAFTA trade deal with Canada and Mexico as a U.S. job killer and was quoted as saying in the New York Times interview that he would be prepared to scrap it if he could not negotiate much better terms for the United States. The North American Free Trade Agreement took effect in 1994 during the administration of President Bill Clinton, the husband of Hillary Clinton. Unlike the NATO treaty, U.S. laws appear to give presidents  significant authority to renegotiate foreign trade deals without consulting Congress, trade experts said.  Trump as president would have an enormous amount of discretion, said Barry Bosworth, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former White House staffer.  If elected, Trump could unilaterally terminate NAFTA or any other free trade deal, although a court would likely have to decide if the president had that authority, said Gary Hufbauer, a former deputy assistant secretary for trade at the Treasury Department. NAFTA was enacted by a law passed by Congress, but Article 2205 of the agreement allows any party to withdraw from the deal with six months notice, and Hufbauer said U.S. courts would likely allow Trump to make that decision.  The president has a lot more power than is generally recognized, said Hufbauer, currently at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank.

"U.S. may take movie, music roles in Malaysia fund asset seizure","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government may become a movie and music industry player, at least temporarily, after moving to seize $1 billion in assets that prosecutors said were bought with money looted from the Malaysian state development fund.  The 2013 movie The Wolf of Wall Street and an interest in the rights of EMI Music Publishing are among the targets of civil lawsuits that are filled with allegations that Malaysian officials, their relatives and associates laundered the funds money and hid it in property, artwork and luxury goods in the United States. Seizures of assets by government authorities are fairly common, but they more typically involve sports cars, yachts and jewelry bought with drug trafficking proceeds or with profits from white-collar crime. The case of the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB announced on Wednesday is unusually large and involves some out-of-the-ordinary assets, such as rights associated with the dark comedy film starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a corrupt New York stockbroker. The film could make another $100 million in the near future, a box office analyst said. According to the lawsuits, a Malaysian national involved in creating 1MDB, Low Taek Jho, used about $10 million from 1MDB to invest in the film and separately used about $107 million to buy a substantial interest in EMI, the worlds third-largest music publishing company by revenue.  Low did not respond to requests for comment sent to his Hong Kong-based company, Jynwel Capital. U.S. government-seized assets are usually sold off at auction to raise money for victims. Until that can happen, U.S. authorities must maintain the assets, officials said. The U.S. Marshals Service manages and auctions seized assets. If a judge approves the seizure of 1MDB-linked assets, the usual process would be followed, Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said. The assets would be initially restrained so their owners could not sell or transfer them. Any profits generated would be held in escrow until the case was resolved, Carr said. We would sell those interests and, if possible and appropriate, use the proceeds of those sales for the benefit of the victim citizens in Malaysia, Carr said in an email.  In the 1990s, the government owned shares in a California casino and through a trustee helped to manage it, putting Washington for a short time in the gambling business. A Marshals Service spokeswoman said she did not immediately know if the agency had previously auctioned film and music royalty rights. The agency had 17,564 assets on hand as of September 2015, valued at $3.1 billion, its website said. Court papers filed by the Justice Department would, if approved by a judge, grant sweeping powers to the Marshals Service to manage the 1MDB-linked assets. Under a proposed restraining order, Red Granite Pictures, which produced The Wolf of Wall Street, would have to maintain present contracts related to the film and allow the United States to join in and direct key business decisions about day to day operations. In a statement, Red Granite said that to its knowledge, none of the money it received was illegitimate and that co-founder Riza Aziz and the company did nothing wrong. Aziz is the stepson of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who oversaw the 1MDB fund. The Justice Department lawsuits said that high-level officials of 1MDB corruptly diverted more than $3.5 billion from the fund over six years. ",politicsNews,"July 21, 2016 ",1
"""Make Republicans Whole Again!"" A divided party struggles to rally behind Trump","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Ted Cruz was recounting to an audience how he had outlasted most of his 16 rivals for the Republican presidential nomination when a plane carrying the man who had won it all, Donald Trump, flew overhead, interrupting him mid-speech. All right, that was pretty well-orchestrated, said Cruz, a Republican U.S. senator from Texas who waged a bitter campaign against Trump. Hours later Cruz would take his revenge, refusing to endorse Trump and urging Republicans to vote their conscience during a prime-time speech on the floor of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. He left the podium to a chorus of boos, and his wife was escorted off the floor as the convention erupted in rancor. Susan Hutchison, chair of the Washington state delegation, said she confronted Cruz after his speech and called him a traitor to the party. So much for party unity. Over three days in Cleveland this week, Republican leaders sought to sell a story of unity. They repeatedly said the party was getting ever closer to rallying behind Trump, who is running on the slogan Make America Great Again! and whose candidacy has divided many and exposed deep discontent among  Republicans with their leaders.  But in a few minutes on Wednesday night that show of unity was blown apart in spectacular fashion. Cruzs non-committal speech infuriated Trump supporters among the thousands of delegates cramming the floor of the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. But their angry jeers triggered recriminations from other delegates.   They talk about unity and then they act like that. That is not going to get us to unify, said Manette Merrill, a Cruz delegate from Washington state.  Trump will get the opportunity to rally the party when he formally accepts its nomination on Thursday night in a speech expected to be watched by millions of Americans, including undecided and independent voters. One of Trumps key goals going into this weeks convention was to unite the party after a roughly 18-month primary season that was marked by personal attacks on candidates, sometimes violent rallies, and deep disagreement over what it means to be a Republican. In public and in private the Trump campaign tried to win over skeptics who feel the New York businessman and celebrity TV star does not represent the partys values. It took a harder stance against opponents, for example shutting down a desperate last-minute bid on the convention floor early in the week to stop his nomination.  Its like a slow crawl, former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said of the unity drive as he made the rounds at the convention. Youre kind of doing it. Youre kind of looking around to see if anyone else is doing it, he told Reuters.  But almost from the start there were blatant signs of party disunity.  Ohio Governor John Kasich, who lost to Trump in the nomination fight and disagrees with Trump on a host of issues, declined to attend the convention held in his own state. Instead, he greeted his supporters at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame close to the convention arena to the blaring tune of The Whos Baba ORiley with lyrics like, I dont need to fight to prove Im right. Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort told reporters that Kasich was embarrassing his state by refusing to get on the Trump train. His remarks were a reminder of the sort of insults that many Republicans had hoped would disappear after a brutal primary season that was characterized by Trumps often personal attacks on his opponents. The pleas for unity were frequent in Cleveland, led by House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top elected Republican, who has been slow in warming to Trump. What do you say that we unify this party at this crucial moment when unity is everything? Ryan asked thousands of convention attendees on Tuesday night. It was the biggest applause line of his speech - delegates cheered, clapped and waved signs. But U.S. Senator Mike Lee of Utah, one of the never Trump holdouts, is still not convinced.  Federalism and separation of powers  if he focuses on that, he brings along a lot of conservatives like me who havent been sold yet, Lee told Reuters. He needs to make that a distinct part of his message. Trump and his surrogates have offered scant policy details so far at the convention, nor have they been able to put to rest questions about whether they are capable of mounting a sophisticated presidential campaign to take on his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. The convention has been overshadowed, for example, by controversy surrounding his wife Melanias convention speech - which included lines uttered by first lady Michelle Obama at the Democratic convention in 2008 - and the campaigns initial reluctance to admit the plagiarism. Some Republicans thought it was an unnecessary distraction at a time when the party should be focused on selling itself and its new leader to Americans.  Others said that if Trump was really serious about uniting the party he would reach out to his vanquished foes on the campaign trail, including Cruz and Kasich.   Ken Cope, a Texas delegate who had backed Cruz for president but will vote for Trump, said the New York businessman needs to swallow his pride and stress the contributions his 16 defeated rivals made to the primary process instead of belittling them. Hes a prideful man and hes proud of what he is but were in a general election campaign and its going to take all of us pulling on the rope if were going to pull the ship to the final line, Cope said. Still others said Trump needed to be more disciplined. Trump supporter John Whitmer, a delegate from Wichita, Kansas, said Trump made a mistake by going on Fox News on Monday night to rail against Kasich as speakers were lauding his candidacy at the televised convention. You just stepped on your best act, Whitmer said. I get that you want to talk about Kasich, but everybody needed to be watching what was going on there. After Wednesday night, the best hope for the Republican Party to come together may rest on Clinton, who was frequently vilified at the Cleveland convention this week. She will be formally nominated as the Democratic presidential nominee at her partys convention in Philadelphia next week. When asked if the party was unified, former Speaker of the House of Representatives and close Trump adviser, Newt Gingrich, replied: No, but we will be by the end of Philadelphia. Trump will get us to 90 percent unity. Shell get us the rest of the way.  ",politicsNews,"July 21, 2016 ",1
"Trumping Trump, Vattenfall to build Scottish wind farm near golf resort","STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedens Vattenfall will invest 3 billion Swedish crowns ($349 million) in a Scottish offshore wind farm that U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump tried to stop being built near his luxury golf course in Scotland. State-owned utility Vattenfall, which will take 100 percent ownership of the project from Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group, described its investment as a vote of confidence in Britain after the nations decision to leave the European Union. The decision to invest ... comes only a few weeks after the British referendum on leaving the EU and demonstrates Vattenfalls continuing long-term commitment to wind power in Great Britain, the company said in a statement. Scotlands First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she would not rule out the possibility of Scotland remaining in the EU. Sturgeon said that a second independence referendum is now a possibility, though she has also emphasized that another vote would not take place until it is clear that most Scots are in favor of breaking from the United Kingdom. Vattenfall said the wind farm will have capacity of 92.4 megawatts, which could potentially supply about 130,000 households with energy. It will also serve as a center for testing and developing new technologies for offshore wind power. In December last year Britains top court threw out a bid by Trump to stop the 11-turbine wind farm from being built near his multimillion-dollar resort. The Trump Organization had denounced the Scottish government as foolish, small minded and parochial. The Scottish National Partys foreign affairs spokesman Alex Salmond replied that Trump was three times a loser. Construction is expected to start in the latter part of 2017, with the wind farm expected to start generating electricity in spring 2018. Onshore construction activity will start later this year.

NATO chief stresses solidarity among NATO allies,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday he would not interfere in the U.S. election campaign, but said that solidarity among allies was a key value for the group. This is good for European security and good for U.S. security, the NATO head said in a statement. The United States has always stood by its European allies. Stoltenbergs comments came after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump raised fresh questions about his commitment to automatically defend NATO allies if they were attacked, the New York Times reported.

"Ted Cruz jeered for refusing to back Trump, exposing Republican rift","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Ted Cruz refused to endorse Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at the partys convention on Wednesday, drawing angry jeers from Trump supporters and shattering the facade of party unity that has been carefully built up in Cleveland this week. Anti-Trump Republican delegate Ken Cuccinelli told Reuters he escorted Cruzs wife, Heidi, off the floor of the Republican National Convention out of concern for her safety following her husbands speech. For the third day in a row, what was supposed to be a carefully scripted show of unity was thrown into turmoil by unexpected events that have raised questions about whether the party can unite around Trump to defeat the presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, in the Nov. 8 election.  Cruz, who came in a distant second to Trump in the race for the Republican nomination, stopped short of endorsing Trump after a bitter and personal campaign and mentioned him only once, drawing boos and repeated chants of We want Trump. Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general, said: When the speech ended, there was an ugly crowd behind us. A witness said one person shouted: Goldman Sachs at Heidi Cruz in reference to her employment at the investment bank. Cruz began his speech saying: I want to congratulate Donald Trump on winning the nomination last night.  Later in the speech, he urged: Please, dont stay home in November. Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution. Some critics saw the appeal for people to vote their conscience as a vote of no-confidence in Trump. Republican strategist Eric Fehrnstrom, who is not affiliated with any campaign, tweeted: Vote your conscience was the rallying cry of the Never Trump movement. For Cruz to bring that message into #RNC hall was a colossal error. Its taken me about 30 minutes to calm down and stop shaking with anger, said Erik Layton, an alternate delegate from California who had shouted: Go home at Cruz after his speech. I just dont know why Cruz did this. It baffles my mind. Trump, 70, a businessman and former reality TV star who has never been elected to public office, made his entrance to the convention hall near the end of Cruzs speech, applauding Cruzs remarks but, by his appearance, drawing attention away from his former rival. In a tweet after the convention adjourned for the night, Trump wrote that Cruz broke a promise they both had made to endorse the partys White House choice. Wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage, didnt honor the pledge! I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway. No big deal! Trump wrote. During the campaign for the partys nomination, Trump insulted Cruzs wifes looks and suggested the Texans father was with John F. Kennedys assassin just before the president was shot in Dallas in 1963.  Cruz, 45, who as a Tea Party conservative in the U.S. Senate angered many mainstream Republicans in Congress and spearheaded tactics that led to a government shutdown over the federal budget, called Trump a serial philanderer and a narcissist during the campaign. A Cruz adviser who asked to remain anonymous said Cruz anticipated a backlash from the crowd if he did not endorse Trump. We knew people were going to be mad if he didnt say the words, but he congratulated him and called for unity behind common values. He expected people to not be thrilled about this, the adviser said.  Trump won the partys nomination on Tuesday with 1,725 delegates, followed by Cruz with 475 delegates. Several delegates were outraged by the reaction to Cruzs speech, saying it could undermine Trumps support among Republicans who had supported the senator from Texas. I thought it was shameful, said Manette Merrill, a Cruz delegate from Washington state, adding she was now confident she would not vote for Trump in November. They talk about unity ... and then they act like that. That is not going to get us to unify, she said. The drama did not prevent Trumps vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, from receiving a raucous welcome inside the convention hall to end the days events. Accepting the conventions nomination, Pence spoke of Trump as a friend of the working class who has persevered in the business world. Hes a doer in a game usually reserved for talkers, Pence said. Trump briefly joined Pence on the stage, shook his hand, patted him on the back, gave a thumbs-up and, in a signal to the crowd, pointed at Pence. But the Cruz speech, the latest in a series of disruptions, overshadowed any show of solidarity. Cruz swiftly became one of the top trending topics on Twitter and Facebook immediately following his speech, with about 157 tweets mentioning his official Twitter handle @tedcruz posted every minute. The overall immediate sentiment was slightly more positive than negative, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph. The most mentioned moment on Twitter on Wednesday was the crowds reaction to Trumps arrival at the conclusion of Cruzs speech. Cruz was also the most mentioned speaker of the night, followed by Pence. Cruz was the most searched speaker on Google. In a speech minutes after Cruz finished, former U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich veered from his prepared text to defend Cruz. I think you misunderstood one paragraph that Ted Cruz, who is a superb orator, said. And I just want to point it out to you. Ted Cruz said you can vote your conscience for anyone who will uphold the Constitution. In this election, there is only one candidate who will uphold the Constitution, Gingrich said. To paraphrase Ted Cruz, if you want to protect the Constitution of the United States, the only possible candidate this fall is the Trump-Pence Republican ticket, Gingrich said. The convention, due to end on Thursday with Trumps speech accepting the partys nomination, has been marked by turmoil from Day One. On Monday, chaos erupted when Trump opponents inside his party stormed out of the room and others chanted to vent frustration over a failed attempt to force a vote in opposition to Trump. On Tuesday, similarities between some phrases in a speech by Trumps wife, Melania, and a 2008 speech by first lady Michelle Obama triggered accusations of plagiarism, putting the Trump campaign on the defensive. A staff writer for the Trump Organization on Wednesday took responsibility for the chaos over the speech. Eminent Republicans such as the partys previous two presidential nominees, Mitt Romney and Senator John McCain, and members of the Bush family that gave the party its last two presidents have stayed away from Cleveland in a show of displeasure at Trump and his rhetoric against illegal immigration and free trade. Opponents brand Trump a bigot with his calls to temporarily ban the entry of Muslims and to build a border wall with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants. Underscoring the problems Trump has faced with U.S. allies abroad, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told Reuters on Wednesday that Trump threatened U.S. and world security with his politics of fear and isolation.

Exclusive: Trump considering fracking mogul Harold Hamm as energy secretary - sources,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is considering nominating Oklahoma oil and gas mogul Harold Hamm as energy secretary if elected to the White House on Nov. 8, according to four sources close to Trumps campaign. The chief executive of Continental Resources (CLR.N) would be the first U.S. energy secretary drawn directly from the oil and gas industry since the cabinet position was created in 1977, a move that would jolt environmental advocates but bolster Trumps pro-drilling energy platform.  Dan Eberhart, an oil investor and Republican financier, said he had been told by officials in Trumps campaign that Hamm, who has been an informal advisor to Trump on energy policy since at least May, was the leading contender for the position.  Eberhart said he had discussed the possible appointment with  top donors at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this week, where Trump was formally nominated as the partys candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Three other sources close to the Trump campaign confirmed Trump was considering Hamm for the post. One of the sources said he first heard that Hamm was a contender from Trump officials on Sunday. None of the sources was aware of who else Trump may be considering for the job. Representatives for Trump and Hamm did not respond to a request for comment.  Addressing the convention on Wednesday night, Hamm called for expanded drilling and said too much environmental regulation    threatened to limit U.S. oil production and increase the countrys dependence on Middle Eastern oil producers. Every time we cant drill a well in America, terrorism is being funded, Hamm told the cheering crowd. Every onerous regulation puts American lives at risk.     Hamm, 70, became one of Americas wealthiest men during the U.S. oil and gas drilling boom over the past decade, tapping into new hydraulic fracturing drilling technology to access vast deposits in North Dakotas shale fields. Past heads of the U.S. Department of Energy, which is charged with advancing U.S. energy security and technology and dealing with nuclear waste disposal, have typically boasted a political or academic background. This is not the first time Hamm has been in contention for the job. The Republican Partys presidential nominee in 2012, Mitt Romney, vetted Hamm to be energy secretary but ultimately decided against him because the two men have differing positions on renewable energy sources like wind.  He made headlines in 2015 after settling a protracted divorce case and agreeing to pay his ex-wife $975 million - reported to be the biggest divorce settlement in history. His fortune is now estimated at nearly $12 billion.   FRACKER-IN-CHIEF Trump, who has yet to make any announcements about his prospective cabinet, has already surrounded himself with strong advocates of traditional energy sources like oil, gas, and coal and has promised to gut environmental regulations to boost drilling and mining if elected. He tapped U.S. Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, a climate skeptic and drilling advocate, to help draw up his campaign energy platform, and picked Indiana Governor Mike Pence, also a climate skeptic, as his running mate.  Both moves cheered the energy industry but alarmed environmental activists who say a Trump presidency would set back years of progress on issues like pollution and climate change.  Given that Hamms as close as weve got to a fracker-in-chief in this country, it would be an apropos pick for a president who thinks global warming is a hoax manufactured by the Chinese, said leading environmental activist Bill McKibben. Trumps Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has promised to bolster regulation and increase use of renewable fuels to combat climate change if elected. ",politicsNews,"July 21, 2016 ",1
"Once a self-funder, Trump's new fundraising machine ramps up","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who gained popularity partly by bashing wealthy donors and vowing to fund his own campaign, raised nearly as much money in June as the campaign of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, according to federal reports filed on Wednesday. In the first month in which the Trump campaigns fundraising machine officially cranked up, Trump raised nearly $20 million from individual donors other than himself, as well as $2 million from donors to his joint fundraising committee with the Republican Party. The reports also showed that Trump converted the nearly $50 million in loans he made to his campaign into donations. He has $20 million in cash in the bank.  Clintons campaign brought in $24 million from individual donors during the same period, and a further $11.5 million from donors to her joint fundraising committee.  Trumps new money dash was also evident at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this week, where two Trump Super PACs - each dueling for supremacy and boasting a roster of marquee donors - held private events. Those in the donor class backing Trump include investor Foster Friess and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who associates say is considering pouring as much as $100 million into helping Trump get elected.

"China upset by U.S. Republican platform on South China Sea, Tibet","BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinas Foreign Ministry on Thursday urged the U.S. Republican Party to stop making groundless accusations against China in its party platform, which says China practices cultural genocide in Tibet and has ludicrous claims in the South China Sea. Chinas government has generally avoided making direct comments about the election, wary of being seen to interfere, though in April Chinese Finance Minister Lou Jiwei called Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump an irrational type due to his tariffs proposal on imported Chinese goods. In an English-language statement issued via the official Xinhua news agency on Thursday, the ministry said the Republican platform contained accusations about China on issues related to Taiwan, Tibet, trade and the South China Sea and are an interference in Chinas internal affairs. All political parties in the United States should view Chinas development in an objective and rational manner and correctly understand the issues that emerge in bilateral ties, the ministry said. We hope relevant parties stop their groundless accusations against China and interference in Chinas domestic affairs and contribute more to bilateral trust and cooperation, it added. The platform, adopted on Monday, says China has been asserting preposterous claims to the South China Sea to distract its people from economic problems, practices cultural genocide in Tibet and Xinjiang, and reaffirms a commitment to sell weapons to self-ruled Taiwan. Chinas foreign ministry said promoting stable growth in relations serves the interests of both countries and the peace and development of the Asia-Pacific region and the world, and both sides should adhere to this right direction. Chinese officials admit to knowing little about Trump compared with his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, who had extensive dealings with China when she was secretary of state.

Factbox: Clinton to name running mate as early as Friday,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton, who is running against Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election, is expected to announce her running mate as early as Friday. Here are some of the potential vice presidential candidates Clinton is considering, according to U.S. news media: The U.S. senator from Virginia is a former Roman Catholic missionary and civil rights lawyer who is fluent in Spanish. Kaine, a former Richmond mayor and former Virginia governor, has served on the Senates Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees.  He has backed liberal causes such as establishing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. But, like many Republicans and moderate Democrats, he has supported free-trade deals, a stance at odds with many party progressives. The U.S. agriculture secretary is a former governor of Iowa.  During the primary, he campaigned enthusiastically for Clinton, speaking about his familys struggles with addiction and mental health. Clinton has promised to address those issues if elected. Vilsack, a Pittsburgh native, was orphaned and adopted as an infant. He settled in his wifes home state of Iowa. New Jerseys first black U.S. senator is a former Newark mayor. He was elected to the Senate in a 2013 special election and won re-election in 2014. Booker campaigned enthusiastically for Clinton, including in the crucial early-voting state of New Hampshire during her primary race against Senator Bernie Sanders. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is a fierce critic of Wall Street who spearheaded the creation of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after the global financial crisis. President Barack Obama tapped her to help set up the agency, but congressional Republicans blocked her appointment. Warren is popular with progressives, and was urged to run for president in 2016 but declined. She endorsed Clinton in June, then joined her on the campaign trail. The retired Navy admiral and former supreme allied commander of NATO is the dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University near Boston. Stavridis worked closely with Clinton when he was at NATO and she led the State Department during Obamas first term. Though Stavridis would bring military heft to Clintons ticket, his role as a senior military official in the George W. Bush administration during the early years of the U.S. occupation of Iraq could provide Trump with a line of attack. Trump has criticized Clinton for, as a U.S. senator, voting for the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.  The U.S. senator from Ohio and former member of the U.S. House of Representatives is one of the Democratic Partys leading progressives. Brown was an early opponent of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement sought by the Obama administration, describing it as a giveaway to corporations. Obamas labor secretary has championed changes in regulations popular with organized labor and progressives.  Perez reversed a regulation exempting domestic and home-care workers from overtime pay and extended overtime protections to some salaried workers by lowering the eligibility threshold.  Perez has little campaigning experience, however, having only held one term on a county council from 2002 to 2006.  The Department of Housing and Urban Development secretary is considered a rising Democratic star. Castro has pushed for expanding opportunities while serving as housing secretary, including by broadening internet access across the country. But progressive groups have criticized his agencys sale of mortgage loans to big banks rather than non-profits during his tenure. A former San Antonio mayor, Castro was elected as the citys youngest councilman at the age of 26.  ",politicsNews,"July 21, 2016 ",1
Green Republicans resist Trump's climate denial in Cleveland,"CLEVELAND/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax and has vowed not to let regulation stand in the way of expanded U.S. oil drilling if elected. But a group of his supporters at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this week are lobbying him to soften that stance. Youth, religious and investor activists aligned with the Republican Party are working the sidelines of the July 18-22 conclave, arguing that a greener platform could help the New York businessman-turned-politician win voters in November. In an age where the Republicans are particularly interested in winning the presidency, they are not supporting an agenda that reflects that most Americans recognize climate change is a problem, said Rachel Lamb, national organizer forthe Young Evangelicals for Climate Action group. Lamb and representatives from other organizations like the Greater Cleveland Young Republicans, environmental advocacy group RepublicEn, and clean energy foundation ClearPath taken part in panel discussions and held private meetings with operatives on the sidelines of the convention. Trump was formally nominated on Tuesday to compete in the Nov. 8 presidential election against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who has made combating climate change a key theme in her campaign. The Republican Party has adopted a platform that calls coal a clean source of electricity and would open more federal land to drilling and mining, while Trump has said he would reverse some of President Barack Obamas key climate change initiatives. Some 64 percent of U.S. adults say they are worried a great deal or a fair amount about global warming, the highest reading since 2008, according to the results of a Gallup poll released in March. Cade Marsh, a representative of the College Republican National Committee, said he was hoping to convince Republicans in Cleveland this week that environmentalism and conservatism are not mutually exclusive. Climate change is a word that is seen as far left, Marsh said. But if you repackage clean energy in terms of national security and liberty, youll find people much more receptive, he said, referring to the role of renewable energy sources like wind power and solar power in reducing dependence on foreign oil. He said his message has been warmly received by convention attendees, but that he held out little hope of a turnaround in Trumps policies. This is about tomorrows Republican party, Marsh said. Jay Faison, a North Carolina Republican donor who founded the ClearPath foundation, said he was telling Republican operatives in Cleveland this week that he would prefer to fund candidates who can put clean energy on the partys agenda. I wonder about the opportunities with the persuadable voters in the middle in terms of the general election, he said. ",politicsNews,"July 21, 2016 ",1
Trump employee apologizes for Melania speech 'chaos',"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - A staff writer for the Trump Organization took responsibility on Wednesday for the chaos caused by a speech given by the wife of U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that drew accusations of plagiarism and cast a shadow over the partys convention this week. The writer, Meredith McIver, apologized and offered an explanation that threw into sharp relief two days of efforts by the Trump campaign to deny there had been a problem with Melania Trumps speech on Monday night. The Republican convention in Cleveland, which formally anointed Trump on Tuesday as the party nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, was meant to be an occasion for the party to rally around its unorthodox White House candidate after a bitterly divisive primary campaign. But the accusations of plagiarism, and the Trump campaigns responses to them, have been a major talking point just as the party tries to showcase a candidate who it believes can appeal to voters and a campaign operation capable of beating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. In a statement, McIver said she had inserted passages into the Melania Trump speech that resembled parts of a 2008 speech by first lady Michelle Obama to the 2008 Democratic National Convention, when Barack Obama was in his first campaign for the presidency. McIver said she had offered to resign over the speech controversy, but Trump and his family had rejected the offer.  The Trump Organization is owned by Donald Trump. Trump defended McIver in an ABC News interview on Wednesday, saying: She made a mistake. People make mistakes. Youve made mistakes. We all make mistakes. He said McIver had been with him for a long time and was a good person. Trump added: I thought it was terrific the way she came forward and just said, Look, it was a mistake that I made. She thought it was very unfair to Melania. In her speech on Monday, Melania Trump spoke of passing on to the next generation the value of hard work that she inherited from her parents and said that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them. My parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise; that you treat people with respect, Melania Trump told the Cleveland convention. In Denver eight years ago, Michelle Obama said she and her husband, Barack, were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect.     McIver said Melania Trump had read passages from Michelle Obamas speech over the phone to her as examples. McIver then wrote them down and later included some of the phrasing in a draft that became Melania Trumps speech. McIver said in her statement that Michelle Obama is a person Melania Trump has always liked.  I did not check Mrs. Obamas speeches. This was my mistake and I feel terrible for the chaos I have caused Melania and the Trumps, as well as to Mrs. Obama. No harm was meant, McIver said. Nowhere in the statement by McIver and comments by Trump campaign officials on the speech has there been any sense of irony that the wife of the Republican nominee was inspired by the words of Michelle Obama at the same time that speaker after speaker at the Republican convention, echoing Trump, assailed her husbands policies. Democrats have seized on the similarities in the speech and the Trump campaigns various explanations over the ensuing 48 hours as showing that his team is not ready for prime time. The charge was all the more embarrassing because Trump has repeatedly slammed Clinton as untrustworthy. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Wednesday the similarities showed the countrys values were largely shared, even if political leaders had differences. That certainly buttresses an argument that the president has been making quite frequently of late, about the country not being as divided as it might seem, Earnest told reporters.  Questions have lingered over why the Trump campaign had not run simple plagiarism software that is commonly used to ensure that speakers do not inadvertently lift other peoples words, and why the campaign sought to deny and brush away the problem. Republican strategist Ted Newton, president of Gravity Strategic Communications and a staffer in Republican Mitt Romneys failed 2012 presidential campaign, said the Trump campaign should have come clean much sooner. It sort of reflects the old adage: Its not the crime, its the cover-up, Newton said. To have it bungled so badly is really a shame and sad for her. If the campaign had admitted what happened sooner, Newton said, It would have been a bump in the road. Hours before giving the speech, Melania Trump, a Slovenian-born jewelry designer and former model, told NBCs Today that she had written it with as little help as possible. But her husbands campaign manager, Paul Manafort, told CBS This Morning on Tuesday that it was a collaboration with speech writers. As late as Wednesday, just hours before McIvers statement, Manafort was pressed again on the issue on CNN. He did not say words had been lifted from the Michelle Obama speech and sought to stress the overall effectiveness of the speech. The controversy that youre talking about is not meaningful at all, he said.  McIver is listed as a writer on some of Trumps most popular books, including Trump: How to Get Rich and Trump: Think Like a Billionaire. Her authors biography in How to Get Rich says she was a Ford Foundation scholar who graduated from the University of Utah, as well as a member of the Trump Organization.

Exclusive: Trump could seek new law to purge government of Obama appointees,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - If he wins the presidency, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would seek to purge the federal government of officials appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama and could ask Congress to pass legislation making it easier to fire public workers, Trump ally, Chris Christie, said on Tuesday. Christie, who is governor of New Jersey and leads Trumps White House transition team, said the campaign was drawing up a list of federal government employees to fire if Trump defeats Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election.  As you know from his other career, Donald likes to fire people, Christie told a closed-door meeting with dozens of  donors at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, according to an audio recording obtained by Reuters and two participants in the meeting. Christie was referring to Trumps starring role in the long-running television show The Apprentice, where his catch-phrase was Youre fired! The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Trumps transition advisers fear that Obama may convert these appointees to civil servants, who have more job security than officials who have been politically appointed. This would allow officials to keep their jobs in a new, possibly Republican, administration, Christie said. Its called burrowing, Christie said. You take them from the political appointee side into the civil service side, in order to try to set up ... roadblocks for your successor, kind of like when all the Clinton people took all the Ws off the keyboard when George Bush was coming into the White House. Christie was referring to pranks committed during the presidential transition from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush in 2001. During that period, some White House staffers removed the W key on computer keyboards and left derogatory signs and stickers in offices, according to a report by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress. One of the things I have suggested to Donald is that we have to immediately ask the Republican Congress to change the civil service laws. Because if they do, it will make it a lot easier to fire those people, Christie said. He said firing civil servants was cumbersome and time-consuming. Christie also said that changing the leadership of the Environmental Protection Agency, long a target of Republicans concerned about over regulation, would be a top priority for Trump should he win in November. Trump has previously vowed to eliminate the EPA and roll back some of Americas most ambitious environmental policies, actions that he says would revive the U.S. oil and coal industries and bolster national security. Christie added that the Trump team wants to let businesspeople serve in government part time without having to give up their jobs in the private sector. Trump frequently says he is better equipped to be president because of his business experience. Although Christie was repeatedly asked during the meeting, he declined to name any potential Cabinet picks. He said Trump was not ready to do that yet. Responding to Christies comments on targeting political appointees on Wednesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that allowing appointees to apply for career civil service positions was a longstanding precedent.  If you want to stack up the ethical record of President Obama and his political appointees against the ethical record compiled by Governor Christie and his political appointees, that wed welcome that kind of comparison, he said. The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union in the United States, said while it was concerned about the practice of burrowing, current law protected most federal employees from at will firing. The federal government is a serious undertaking. Its not a reality TV show, with Youre fired! said Jacqueline Simon, policy director at AFGE. Just as we dont want to hire anybody for political reasons, we dont want anybody to be fired for political reasons, she said. As of March 2016, there were a total of 3,164 political appointees, 852 of whom were presidential appointees.  In its most recent report on the topic, the Government Accountability Office said in 2010 that 143 former political appointees and congressional employees converted to career positions between May 1, 2005, and May 30, 2009.  The Republican-controlled House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee is investigating the practice of burrowing. It sent letters dated Wednesday to 23 federal departments and agencies, asking them to document all cases of burrowing that have occurred since Sept. 1, 2015. ",politicsNews,"July 20, 2016 ",1
U.S. appeals court voids forfeiture of Iran-linked New York office tower,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court said on Wednesday the U.S. government cannot seize a Midtown Manhattan office tower originally built by the Shah of Iran, whose owners it claimed were fronts for the Iranian government. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also said hundreds of victims of terrorist acts linked to Iran could not force the owners of 650 Fifth Avenue to turn over the building or pay unsatisfied money judgments they had won against the country, finding no proof that the owners and Iran were legally one and the same. Both decisions were written by Circuit Judge Richard Wesley for a unanimous three-judge panel, and totaled 145 pages. They overturned rulings by U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest against the nonprofit Alavi Foundation, which promotes Islamic culture and the Persian language, and 650 Fifth Avenue Co, of which Alavi is a 60 percent owner. The owners had claimed they were given no chance to show why they should not be held liable. Iran was not a defendant in the lawsuits, which were returned to Forrests courtroom, including for a possible trial in the governments forfeiture case. We are very pleased, Daniel Ruzumna, a lawyer for the owners, said in an email. We look forward to vindicating our clients rights and interests at trial. James Bernard, a lawyer for the victims, said his clients also looked forward to a trial. The office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan did not respond to a request for comment. The 36-story building in question is just north of Rockefeller Center and St. Patricks Cathedral, and would likely fetch hundreds of millions of dollars in a sale. In seeking the forfeiture of that building, several other properties and various bank accounts, authorities accused Alavi of engaging in money laundering that violated U.S. sanctions against Iran, and knowing that the buildings minority owner, Assa Corp, was backed by state-controlled Bank Melli. But Wesley said Forrest failed to properly review evidence that demonstrated a genuine dispute as to whether Alavi knew of Bank Mellis control over Assa. He also said Forrest acted too quickly in rejecting defense arguments that authorities waited too long to seek a forfeiture, and that evidence obtained by a search warrant should have been suppressed. In the victims case, Wesley said Forrest erred in finding that the buildings owners could under the federal Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act qualify as Iran itself, or be deemed its agents or instrumentalities. The appeals court directed Forrest to examine whether the victims could prevail under another federal law, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. The cases are In re: 650 Fifth Avenue and Related Properties, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-2027; and Kirschenbaum et al v. 650 Fifth Avenue and Related Properties in the same court, No. 14-1963.

"Daimler AG, Ferrari selling some new vehicles with faulty air bags: U.S. Senate report","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Daimler AGs Mercedes-Benz USA and Daimler Vans units and Ferrari NV are among a small group of automakers selling some new vehicles with faulty Takata airbags that will be subject to recalls by the end of 2018, a U.S. Senate report said on Wednesday. The vehicles are legal to sell since the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has said they will not become potentially unsafe until exposed to high humidity for an extended period. Safety advocates and some in Congress have criticized the sale of vehicles that will be recalled. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, said the vehicles include the 2016 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter and 2016-2017 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Coupe/Convertible and numerous 2016 and 2017 Ferrari models including the FF, California T, 488 GTB/488 Spider, F12/F12tdf and GTC4 Lusso. Nelson said the report underscores the failure of certain automakers and regulators to level with people about the true extent of the problem and to have the cars fixed before theyre sold. Mercedes Benz USA spokeswoman Donna Boland said the company has told regulators that its dealers will be informing prospective buyers of the pending recall on these models at the time of purchase in the very near future. Ferrari spokeswoman Krista Florin said the Italian automaker also plans to notify customers of the future recalls.Seven out of 17 automakers Nelson contacted have admitted to equipping some new vehicles with defective Takata airbags, including Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE). All agreed to notify buyers of the planned recalls. Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) is the only automaker that has not provided a written response, Nelson said. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday from Reuters. NHTSA said in May Tesla would be required to recall vehicles for Takata inflators. Takata inflators can explode with excessive force and spray metal shrapnel. They are suspected in at least 13 deaths worldwide and more than 100 injuries. In May, Takata agreed to declare as defective, by 2018, another 35 million to 40 million U.S. inflators that lack drying agents in frontal airbags after 14 automakers previously recalled more than 24 million U.S. vehicles. Worldwide nearly 100 million inflators have been declared defective. NHTSA said there have been no ruptures in vehicles built since 2008. According to NHTSA, the vehicles do not become vulnerable to exploding airbags without long-term exposure to high humidity. In the short-term, the agency says, they are safe to drive and much safer than older models. ",politicsNews,"July 20, 2016 ",1
Trump staff writer takes responsibility for Melania speech controversy,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - A staff writer of the Trump Organization, the company owned by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, has claimed responsibility for inserting passages in a speech given at the Republican National Convention by Trumps wife Melania that resembled parts of a 2008 speech by first lady Michelle Obama. The woman, Meredith McIver, released a statement on Wednesday apologizing for using the language, which she said Melania Trump recited to her in a phone call, without checking to see how closely it matched Obamas speech at the Democratic National Convention eight years ago.

"In a first, U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce endorses Clinton for president","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton, the groups first-ever endorsement for a presidential nominee and a rebuke of Republican Donald Trump in the middle of his partys convention. The Trump campaign has gone from frankly something that was entertaining, comical, and has devolved into something that is frankly scary, said Javier Palomarez, the chamber president and chief executive officer. He said the group weighed in because of Trumps rhetoric, which has angered many in the U.S. minority community. Trump has been accused of bigotry for his hard line on immigration, and many of his comments have been blasted as racist ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. It wasnt a step that was taken easily, Palomarez said, noting that many of the chambers board and members are staunch Republicans. Trump kicked off his campaign last year saying Mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers across the border, and he proposed building a wall to stop them. He has called for a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants to shore up national security and suggested an Indiana-born federal judge was unable to hear a lawsuit against his Trump University venture because the judge is of Mexican descent.  The New York businessmans positions have angered minority groups, liberals, Democrats, and even some Republicans, who have called them racist, divisive and callous.  Among black, Hispanic and Asian voters polled in the first 15 days of July, 70 percent supported Clinton while 9 percent supported Trump, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll. Over that time, 45 percent of all likely voters supported Clinton and 34 percent supported Trump.  Trump became his partys official nominee to the presidency on Tuesday at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Palomarez said the Clinton campaign earned their groups endorsement by doing significant outreach to Latinos, including asking to speak with chamber members in different parts of the country.  I think she understands the challenges of American small businesses, he said. The convention had a dramatic start, as anti-Trump delegates tried, and failed, to force a roll-call vote that would record the number of delegates opposed to the New York real estate developer. The chamber is an organization of Hispanic business leaders representing the interests of Hispanic-owned businesses nationwide. It had endorsed Clinton and Republican John Kasich in their respective primaries, the groups first-ever such endorsements. ",politicsNews,"July 20, 2016 ",1
Campaign aims to register a million U.S. Muslims voters in anti-Trump move,"FALLS CHURCH, Va. (Reuters) - U.S. Muslim leaders hope to register a million voters from within their community to help combat what they say is the anti-Muslim stance of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. The United States has only about 3.3 million Muslims, but campaign organizers say Muslim voters could have an outsize impact in swing states that are key to the November general election, such as Virginia and Florida. We want the Muslim community to understand that if you give up your rights voluntarily, no one will come and give it back to you, said Osama Abu Irshaid, a member of the board of the U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations, which is spearheading the drive. Imams have been asked to encourage their congregations to register to vote. Organizers have sent canvassers to college campuses, bus stations and gas stations in Muslim neighborhoods. The campaign began in December and is part of an effort among U.S. Muslims to combat an unprecedented rise in Islamophobia, said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). CAIRs database showed that 300,000 Muslims had registered since November, he said. Awad said anti-Muslim sentiment had grown since the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, last year that authorities have said was inspired by Islamist militants, and due to comments by Trump. He has called for a ban on Muslim immigrants. Campaign volunteers were outside the Dar al-Hijrah mosque in suburban Washington this month to get worshippers to register. I was thinking quite a long time to register but this time especially ... I really believed that I have to, said Sadat Najmi as he filled out a registration form. Najmi, a U.S. citizen since 1988, said Trump had motivated him to sign up for the first time. U.S. Muslim backers of Trump said they were trying to build their own coalitions in swing states.  Baltimore businessman Sajid Tarar said he launched American Muslims for Trump because he favored Trumps stance on combating radical Islam. ISIS (an acronym for the Islamic State), al Qaeda, Taliban, they have killed more Muslims than anything else, and thats a message Muslims need to hear and understand, he said, referring to various militant groups. Michael Cohen, co-chair of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump, which aims to mobilize minority support, said Muslim Americans were equally worried about violence at home and abroad. Trump is the only candidate who will enhance our national security, bring jobs back to America and fix our ailing economy, he said in an email. ",politicsNews,"July 20, 2016 ",1
"Behind the scenes, Ryan touts his agenda in Cleveland, not Trump's","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan offered his strongest support yet for Donald Trumps White House bid on Tuesday at the Republican National Convention, saying the New York businessman he has repeatedly criticized provides America a chance at a better way.  Behind the scenes in Cleveland, the highest-ranking elected Republican has been shopping a competing vision for the party, backed by some wealthy donors and Republican establishment figures who see him as the savior of a party thrown into turmoil by Trumps candidacy. The support reflects deep divisions within the party over Trumps harder line on stemming illegal immigration and his threats to scrap trade deals that he says have hurt American workers but establishment Republicans view as central to their free trade policies. The split has created an identity crisis for the party, embodied in the figures of Trump and Ryan.  Everybody knows the tough spot Paul Ryan is in, said Annie Dickerson, a New York delegate to the convention and close adviser to Republican financier Paul Singer, referring to Ryans dilemma in backing a candidate as the partys standard bearer in the Nov. 8 presidential election who does not represent many of its traditional values. Hes the antidote to all the frustration thats in Cleveland this week, she said, noting that despite a public push for unity, there are those still unhappy with Trumps nomination. Ryan, 46, is chairman of the convention at which Trump was officially nominated on Tuesday. But he has kept a low profile, avoiding the conventions opening day on Monday, and instead holding meetings with state delegations and addressing private gatherings of Republican supporters, according to aides and attendees. At the meetings, according to attendees, Ryan has been pushing his Better GOP platform, a six-part agenda that shares strong similarities to the form of conservatism President George W. Bush advocated - reduced regulation, lower taxes, and welfare reform. It contrasts with the speeches typically delivered by Trump, who prefers to lambaste his opponents and skip detailed policy discussions. Doug Heye, a former House Republican leadership aide close to Ryan, said Ryans platform gives them something that they can talk to constituents about that isnt divisive, that isnt name calling.  Heye said the approach could help Ryan position himself as the face of the party if Trump loses the election.  Ryan has publicly clashed with Trump over the latters promise to deport millions of illegal immigrants and end trade deals. He criticized Trumps call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country and called his remarks about the heritage of a Mexican-American judge racist. Ryan supports free trade and comprehensive immigration reform, and as chairman of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, he authored a document that called for a drastically reduced federal government.  The risk for Ryan is that a swath of the party is moving away from traditional Republican orthodoxy, and by not embracing Trump he could find himself isolated. Some of Trumps supporters see him as emblematic of the Washington dysfunction that has angered many Republicans.  Mark Bolin, a Canton, Ohio, business owner who supports Trump, called Ryans tepid endorsement of Trump political suicide. He said Ryan and other Republicans leaders cant admit their own failures. Instead of them thinking theres something wrong with their party, they think it must be us, the American people arent smart enough, Bolin said.  Ryan has long been seen as a rising star and some wealthy donors pushed Ryan, who was the vice presidential nominee in 2012, to run for president this year. He declined but hasnt ruled out running in the future. Advisers to Singer and the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers say the donors are banking on Ryan to carry the flag for traditional Republican values. I like Ryan and his day to lead the party will come - very soon, if Trump loses, said energy magnate Dan Eberhart, another major donor.   Linda Devore, 66, a retired attorney from Fayetteville, North Carolina, who met Ryan for the first time in 2012, rushed over to give him a hug when he arrived on Tuesday morning to speak to her delegation at a hotel in the Cleveland.  Hes just one of the smartest Republicans. Thats what I told him, Devore said. Hes a quick wit. He said, Pretty low bar, huh?  ",politicsNews,"July 20, 2016 ",1
"Beating rivals and the odds, Trump captures Republican nomination","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Thirteen months after launching an improbable bid for the White House, Donald Trump captured the 2016 Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday, having vanquished 16 party rivals, warred with much of its establishment and provoked controversy at every turn. His eldest child, Donald Trump Jr., announced the support of New York, their home state, during a roll-call vote at the Republican National Convention, ensuring Trump had the majority of delegates - 1,237 - needed to contest the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. With three of the candidates other children at his side, the younger Trump said: It is my honor to be able to throw Donald Trump over the top in the delegate count tonight. Congratulations, Dad. We love you, he said. Trumps Democratic rival, Clinton, who has been the target of withering verbal attacks during the convention, was quick to respond to the vote, tweeting: Donald Trump just became the Republican nominee. Chip in now to make sure he never steps foot in the Oval Office. Trump won with 1,725 delegates, followed by U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas with 475 delegates, Ohio Governor John Kasich with 120 and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida with 114. Three other candidates emerged with a total of 12 delegates. After the presidential nominating vote, the convention by voice vote nominated Indiana Governor Mike Pence, 57, Trumps choice for his vice presidential running mate. Speaking to the convention for the first time since winning the nomination, Trump appeared on a video screen from New York promising to win the election in November, create jobs, strengthen the military, safeguard U.S. borders and restore law and order in the United States. The state-by-state vote to put Trumps name in nomination took place a day after opponents staged a failed attempt to force a vote opposing his candidacy at the start of the four-day convention, and after a speech by his wife, Melania, drew accusations of plagiarism. A wealthy New York real estate developer best known to Americans for his starring role in a long-running TV show, The Apprentice, where his catchphrase was Youre fired, the 70-year-old Trump was a long shot when he entered the race for the Republican nomination more than a year ago, having never held elected office. On Tuesday, under the headline Make America Work Again, speakers at Clevelands Quicken Loans basketball arena were meant to assail Democratic President Barack Obamas record on the economy during his nearly eight years in power. Instead, speaker after speaker took aim at Clinton, presenting her as out of touch with the concerns of ordinary Americans and the inheritor of Obamas oppressive administration. A former secretary of state under Obama, Clinton, 68, was due to be formally nominated at the Democratic National Convention next week in Philadelphia. Trump trails Clinton in many opinion polls after a bruising Republican primary season. Trump narrowed his deficit against her to 7 percentage points from 15 points late last week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday.  Trump initially refused to rule out an independent run should he fail to win the Republican nomination.  Within weeks of announcing his candidacy at Trump Tower in New York on June 16, 2015, Trump had taken a commanding lead in the Republican race, defying pundits who were quick to write him off and eclipsing the man many had thought would be crowned on Tuesday night - former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, part of a Republican political dynasty. In a campaign marked by insults and inflammatory rhetoric, Trump tapped into a deep vein of unhappiness running through white Middle America, giving voice to millions who felt left behind in the rush to globalization and who eschewed traditional establishment Republicans like Bush in favor of a brash political outsider who promised to Make America Great Again. Weve lost the confidence in our leaders and the faith in our institutions, Donald Trump Jr. said in a convention speech. Were still Americans. Were still one country and were going to get it all back. I know well get it back because I know my father, Trump Jr. said. Opponents brand Trump a bigot with his calls to temporarily ban the entry of Muslims and to build a border wall with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants. Underscoring the problems Trump has faced with U.S. allies abroad, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Trump threatened U.S. and world security with his politics of fear and isolation. Steinmeier told Reuters in a written interview that he was concerned about what he called Trumps ambiguous vows to make America strong again, while simultaneously reducing its engagement overseas. Party officials hope to use the convention to smooth out some of Trumps rough edges and present him as a job creator and a strong hand to combat security threats at home and abroad. U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, an early backer of Trump, placed his name in nomination, calling him a warrior and a winner. Two senior Republicans, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, spoke in favor of Trump. Republicans need Trump to do well in the November election as they seek to preserve Republican majorities in Congress. Security forces were on high alert in Cleveland. But police said late on Tuesday there had been only five arrests since the convention began on Monday. Wright State University, a public university near Dayton, Ohio, said on Tuesday it had decided not to host the first U.S. presidential debate scheduled for Sept. 26, citing mounting costs and security concerns. The event will now be held at Hofstra University in New York. While in Cleveland, Trump ally Chris Christie said on Tuesday that should Trump win the presidency, he would seek to purge the federal government of officials appointed by Obama  and could ask Congress to pass legislation making it easier to dismiss public workers. Christie, who is governor of New Jersey and leads Trumps White House transition team, told dozens of donors the campaign was drawing up a list of federal government employees to fire if Trump defeats Clinton.

"On bike, horse and foot, police keep order outside Republican convention","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - City police on bicycles and horseback, backed by state and local officers from across the country, kept order outside the Republican National Convention on Tuesday, as predictions that protester unrest would tarnish the event did not come to pass for a second day. There have been only five arrests since the convention began on Monday, police announced at an early evening news conference. As sundown neared, the mood on downtown streets was calm. In Tuesdays largest demonstration, police on bicycles rode into the crowd in the citys Public Square in mid afternoon. Helmeted officers, some in protective equipment and others wearing shorts, separated a crowd of Black Lives Matters protesters from other protesters wearing masks and helmets, occasionally lifting their bikes to push through the crowd. If America is so bad, why dont you leave?, a pro-Trump demonstrator shouted at a group carrying signs that read, America was never great A pair of men dressed in traditional Muslim garb walked near the plaza carrying assault-style rifles, with one also bearing a semiautomatic handgun. Micha Noziri of Yellow Spring, Ohio, who is not Muslim, said he wanted to take a stance against Trumps positions on religious minorities and immigration.  We came out to show solidarity for all minority groups, the so-called minority groups that Donald Trump would oppress if he does the things that he says, Noziri told a knot of reporters surrounding him. Ten men identifying themselves as Ohio militia walked through Public Square with weapons on open display, surrounded by a pack of journalists.  Police escorted conservative radio host Alex Jones from the square, amid shouting and jostling, after Jones used a megaphone to shout invective about Black Lives Matter and other groups toward a group of liberal-leaning protesters.   Dozens of Cleveland police on bicycles and dozens more in state police uniforms intervened. They walked Jones and a handful of supporters past a few hundred demonstrators and journalists.  One Trump supporter, Elam Stoltzfus, said he felt very safe watching the scene. About 150 police were here in a minute, Stoltzfus said in reference to events that led up to Jones being escorted away. Ohio is an open-carry state; we have a lot of protection here. Earlier Tuesday, police arrested three people for climbing flagpoles near Clevelands Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and hanging a banner with the words, Dont Trump Our Communities. Firefighters used a ladder truck to assist in the arrest, police officials said. ",politicsNews,"July 20, 2016 ",1
Melania Trump's speech has an echo of Michelle Obama words,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Melania Trumps speech at the Republican National Convention has ignited controversy because it contained a section strikingly similar to words delivered at the Democratic convention in 2008 by the woman she hopes to succeed as U.S. first lady, Michelle Obama. An official with the campaign of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump suggested the similarity in the section to Michelle Obamas speech may have been the result of an error by her team of speech writers. Donald Trump made no mention of the issue in a Twitter post early on Tuesday, saying simply: It was truly an honor to introduce my wife, Melania Trump last night. Her speech and demeanor were absolutely incredible. Very proud! Trump has never held elective office and his White House campaign has been marked by frequent controversy over unorthodox policies and freewheeling remarks that have alarmed many in the Republican establishment. It is a tradition of the party conventions for spouses to offer an enthusiastic personal endorsement of candidates. On Tuesday night, the gathering in Cleveland will formally anoint Donald Trump the Republican presidential candidate for the Nov. 8 election. It was a small section of Melania Trumps roughly 15-minute speech, a highlight of the opening day of the convention, that was similar to a part of Michelle Obamas speech in 2008 in support of Barack Obama, who was then campaigning for president. My parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise; that you treat people with respect, said Melania Trump, a Slovenian-born jewelry designer and former model. They taught me to show the values and morals in my daily life. That is the lesson that I continue to pass along to our son, she said. And we need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow, because we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them. In 2008, Michelle Obama said, And Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect. ...And Barack Obama and I set out to build lives guided by these values, and pass them on to the next generations, she added. Because we want our children, and all children in this nation, to know that the only limit to the height of your achievement is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them. Before Mondays speech, Melania Trump told NBC in remarks that were aired on several networks:I wrote it... with as little help as possible. A spokesman for the Trump campaign called the speech a success, but suggested her writers might have mistakenly injected some borrowed language. In writing her beautiful speech, Melanias team of writers took notes on her lifes inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking, Jason Miller, Trumps senior communications adviser, said in a statement. Paul Manafort, chairman of the Trump campaign, played down the similarities in the Trump and Obama speeches. There arent that many similarities. There are a couple of phrases, Manafort told CBS News on Tuesday. Its basically three places in the speech and its fragments of words. She spoke in front of 35 million people yesterday. She knew what she was doing. And she never cribbed from another speech without acknowledging that she was quoting somebody else. There was nothing that she did in that speech that she thought was anybodys words but herself, Manafort said. Asked if she wrote it herself, Manafort said it was a collaboration and he didnt know how much exactly she had written. But the words of her speech reflect her feelings for her husband, her country and her family. Frankly this was her vision that she wanted to communicate about her husband. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, asked if as a former prosecutor he could make a case for plagiarism from Melania Trumps speech, replied: No, not when 93 percent of the speech is completely different from Michelle Obamas speech, and they express common thoughts. I think after tonight we wont be talking about this, well move on to whatever ... comes up tonight, Christie, a former rival to Trump for the Republican presidential nomination who now supports him, told NBCs Today show on Tuesday. (This story corrects to show Melania interview was with NBC, paragraph 13) ",politicsNews,"July 19, 2016 ",1
'We're not electing a husband:' Tough-talking Trump wins over some skeptical women,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Donald Trumps tough talk on law and order in a time of growing national insecurity appears to be winning over some of his fiercest skeptics - women initially put off by his swaggering tone, his clashes with female critics and past affairs.  But so far those are mostly conservative women. As Trump hones his message, the challenge is to make it also resonate among independent or undecided female voters who are crucial to his hopes of winning the U.S. presidential election in November. Turmoil on the streets both abroad and at home could give Trump a new opportunity to do just that. On Monday, Trump tried to seize it with an evening program at the Republican National Convention with several women speakers, including his wife Melania, focused on security. She told the convention that her husband would offer the country new leadership and keep it safe and secure. Americans have been rattled by recent attacks in France and Florida, the murder of police officers in Texas and Louisiana, and widespread protests over the killings of unarmed black men, polls show. Were not electing a husband, were not electing a preacher, were electing a leader, said Kay White, a Republican delegate to the nominating convention from Tennessee who originally supported U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the early nominating contests, or primaries. For White, its a one-issue election. Security, she said. Nothing else matters. A year ago, Penny Nance, president of Concerned Women for America, a conservative advocacy group, was a blistering critic of the thrice-married Trump because of comments he made about  Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly that many felt were sexist.  But Nance now supports Trump and says the candidate can fashion an effective message for women centered on national security, she told Reuters on the sidelines of the convention. Every day we wake up and get our kids ready for school and the television is on and there is another attack, she said. For Trump, independents will be a tougher sell. A majority of women who identify as independent continue to hold an unfavorable opinion of him. According to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll from June 1 to July 15, 64 percent of independent women voters expressed a very unfavorable or somewhat unfavorable view of Trump. That compares with 89 percent of Democratic women voters and 31 percent of Republican women voters who have a similarly unfavorable view of the New York businessman.  Trump isnt the first candidate whose tough talk on security has won over women voters. George W. Bush used the same message in his re-election campaign in 2004, in the midst of his war on terror, to appeal to so-called security moms who were concerned about terrorism.  Bush garnered 48 percent of the vote of American women in that election. By comparison, Republican candidate Mitt Romney drew 44 percent in 2012, a full 10 points behind President Barack Obama.  Trump has had trouble convincing women nationally to support him ever since he entered the race in the summer of 2015, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Among women who are expected to vote on Nov. 8, a majority expressed an unfavorable opinion of him every time they were asked in the polls. This month, women appeared to have soured even more on the likely Republican nominee: 69 percent of likely women voters expressed an unfavorable opinion of Trump in the latest July 11-15 Reuters/Ipsos polling, up from 63 percent in the five-day poll that ended on July 1.  Jen Lawless, director of the Women and Politics Institute at American University, said she doubted Trump could rehabilitate his image with most women voters, saying his conflict with Kelly, in particular, had lasting damage. I think that ship has sailed, Lawless said.  Trumps problems with women were dramatized on Monday when Women for Trump, a voter-support group, held a sparsely attended event in Cleveland.  The moderator, Jennifer Hulsey, appeared to speak for a lot of women who have found a way to support Trump. Hes not perfect, but neither am I, Hulsey said.  Some of the women delegates interviewed by Reuters at the convention on Monday were scornful of the criticism of Trumps attitude toward women, pointing to his daughter Ivanka, who is a top executive in the Trump Organization.  Ivanka and his other daughter Tiffany are due to speak at the convention this week. He was not my first choice or even my second choice, said   Carol Del Carlo, a Trump supporter. But, I look at him and I see how he treats his daughters. Theyre engaged, they look like a real, true family, they work in their fathers business, theyre advisors. ",politicsNews,"July 19, 2016 ",1
Trump narrows gap with Clinton as Republicans rally in Cleveland: Reuters/Ipsos,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump narrowed his deficit to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to 7 percentage points from 15 points late last week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday,  Polling was under way on Tuesday at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland to officially nominate Trump as the partys candidate for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Clinton is due to be officially nominated at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia next week. Forty-three percent of likely voters supported Clinton in the July 15-19 poll, while 36 percent supported Trump. The poll included 1,069 voters and had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.  The previous poll, in which Trump trailed Clinton by 15 percentage points, covered the five-day period that ended July 14.  Trumps rise appeared partly fueled by a decline in the number of voters who remained on the sidelines. The percentage of voters who supported neither candidate dropped to 12 percent in the July 15-19 poll from 15 percent in the July 10-14 poll. Clinton has led in the poll most of the year.  The last time that Trump matched Clintons level of support was in mid-May, after his remaining rivals for the Republican nomination dropped out and many Republican leaders started to openly support his bid for the White House.  This weeks Republican convention provides another opportunity for party leaders to publicly embrace Trumps campaign. Presidential nominees typically see a boost in voter support following their party conventions. In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney jumped by about 5 percentage points in the Reuters/Ipsos poll following the Republican convention. This year, however, Republican leaders have struggled to give a full-throated endorsement of Trumps America First campaign over his hard line on immigration and trade, and his fiery rhetoric that some have called bigoted. Many Republican elders, including both former presidents Bush and the last two presidential nominees, Romney and John McCain, are staying away from Cleveland.  The convention also has been marred by protests from anti-Trump delegates and a controversy over a speech by Trumps wife, Melania, that included a section that was strikingly similar to a portion of the speech given by Michelle Obama at the Democratic convention in 2008 when her husband, Barack Obama, was seeking his first term as president.

Melania Trump's RNC speech produces so-so TV audience,"(Reuters) - Melania Trumps big night at the Republican National Convention failed to draw bumper television audiences despite networks boosting their coverage of the gathering and husband Donald Trump promising a showbiz feel to the week. According to Nielsen ratings data on Tuesday from seven leading broadcast and cable networks, an estimated 23 million people watched Monday evenings highlight during the 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. hour when Melania Trump, the wife of Republican White House contender Donald Trump, delivered her speech. The focus of the convention initially shifted on Tuesday from the formal anointing of Trump to accusations that sections of Melania Trumps speech were strikingly similar to an address by Michelle Obama at the Democratic convention in 2008. The early viewing figures were similar to those for the first night of the Republican convention in 2012, which attracted an audience of 22.3 million, according to Nielsen.  U.S. television networks have boosted coverage of the Republican convention this year after Trump, a New York businessman, drew huge audiences during the 2016 presidential debates during the state nominating contests. Trump, the former star of The Apprentice TV show, has promised to throw out traditional political convention scripts and put some showbiz into the mix.  Media analysts predicted that viewership for Trumps acceptance speech this week for the Republican presidential nomination could surpass the record 38 million who watched Barack Obama address the Democratic convention in 2008. In 2012, the Democratic convention generally drew more nightly TV viewers than the Republican gathering, when Mitt Romney was running for the White House. On Monday, the Fox News cable channel, as expected, got the most viewers for its convention coverage, averaging 6.4 million in the 10 p.m. hour. Among the mainstream networks, NBC led with 3.9 million. However, the biggest single program audience of Monday night was for reality show The Bachelorette, which was seen by some  6.6 million on ABC. About 3 million people turned off when ABC switched to the convention. ",politicsNews,"July 19, 2016 ",1

Dont Trump our communities, read the banner hung near Clevelands Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Using a ladder truck, fire officials brought down the protesters and the banner, which also had an anti-fracking message.

The suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleges that DynCorp knowingly allowed one of its subcontractors to charge excessive rates for hotels, translator, security guard and driving services, and overhead expenses, and included these charges in claims it submitted under the State Department contract, the Justice Department said in a statement.

Supreme Court nominee out in cold as election heats up," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Merrick Garland hit an unwanted milestone on Tuesday as the federal appeals court judges nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court reached its 125th day with no Senate action, tying for the longest pending nomination ever to the high court.  In a move with little precedent in American history, the Republicans who control the Senate have simply refused to take any action on President Barack Obamas nomination of Garland, 63, for a lifetime job on the nations top court.  Having been nominated on March 16 to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13, Garland, chief judge of the federal appeals court in Washington, has now matched Louis Brandeis for the longest time between nomination and Senate action.  In 1916, the Senate voted to confirm Brandeis, making him Americas first Jewish justice.  The U.S. Constitution assigns the Senate the power to confirm the presidents nominations to the Supreme Court. The Senates inaction on Garland has made the court vacancy a key political prize in a presidential election year.  Republicans, hopeful of winning back the White House from the Democrats in the Nov. 8 election, insist that Obamas successor name Scalias replacement, who could have a lasting effect on the ideological balance of a court now split with four liberals and four conservatives.  Obama has appointed two of the current justices: liberals Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.  The White House and its allies made another push on Tuesday to highlight Republican intransigence.  Now, despite Chief Judge Garlands extraordinary qualifications, Republicans in the Senate have refused to do their job, and Chief Judge Garlands nomination has now been pending longer than any Supreme Court nominee in history whos nomination was not otherwise withdrawn, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters.  Despite his outstanding record and qualifications, Republicans have obstructed Judge Garlands nomination in a way faced by no other Supreme Court nominee in our nations history, added Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid.  The Senate is on recess until September.  For the rival presidential hopefuls, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, the Supreme Court vacancy is both a political problem and an opportunity.  In addition to Scalias replacement, the next president conceivably could nominate as many as three more justices. Three of the courts current eight members already are over age 77. That means Obamas successor could influence the courts ideological direction for decades.  Some conservatives view Trump with suspicion. But the wealthy New York real estate developer has already floated names of conservative potential nominees in a bid to mollify some on the right.  Garland has established a reputation as a centrist in 19 years as an appellate judge. Some liberal Democrats have said Clinton, if elected, could put forth a nominee more liberal than Garland, so Republicans would be smart to approve him before Obama leaves office on Jan. 20.  Such arguments have not swayed Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who refuses to let Garland come to a vote.  The development most likely to prod Senate action is the result of the presidential election. Some Republican senators have said if Clinton wins, the Senate should confirm Garland in a lame-duck post-election session out of fear Clinton would name someone far more liberal. If Clinton wins, she also could renominate Garland upon taking office.  Garlands nomination is unusual because there has been no controversy over his suitability to sit on the Supreme Court, as there have been with some nominees in the past. He is widely respected in the legal community and has been praised by both Democrats and Republicans as a moderate.  The White House tried to persuade Republicans to accept Garland when he was first nominated in March. He met with 61 of the 100 senators. But the effort fizzled, and Republicans largely followed McConnells lead.  The White House since then has tried to keep the Garland nomination in the public eye, with limited success. Obama wrote an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal on Monday, pushing for Senate action.  A White House-allied group called the Constitutional Responsibility Project is running a We Need Nine campaign that refers to the number of justices on a fully staffed court. It has bought ads in Cleveland, where the Republican presidential nominating convention began on Monday, calling for senators to do your job and bring Garlands nomination to a Senate vote.  In the meantime, Garland is nowhere to be seen. His last public appearance was on June 15 when he spoke at an elementary school commencement event in Washington.  When nominated, Garland stepped aside from pending cases before the appeals court where he works. His only official duties now are administrative as the court's chief judge. A court official said Garland will continue to not participate in cases while the nomination is pending.  ",politicsNews,"July 19, 2016 ",1
Cleveland police say no shots fired on vehicle near Cleveland convention,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Police in Cleveland said that no gunshots had been fired on a transport vehicle near the site of the Republican National Convention on Tuesday following a Reuters report of gunshots. There were no shots fired on any of our police transport vehicles right now near the Quicken Loans Arena, officials said in a statement released by the Joint Information Center overseeing security at the four-day event. We called all transport vehicles. They reported all clear. Earlier, a Reuters reporter standing near a police officer heard radio traffic stating that shots had been fired.

Justice Department changes social media policy after rogue tweet criticizing CNN,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is changing its social media policy following a tweet mistakenly sent from the departments official account on Tuesday that called CNN the biggest troll of them all, a department official said. In a statement, the staff member in the public affairs office erroneously used the official Department of Justice Twitter handle to post a tweet that was intended for a personal account. The statement did not identify the staff member, but said the persons access to the departments social media accounts had been revoked. Going forward, the Justice Departments public affairs office will implement procedural changes around the use of social media accounts and provide additional training to its employees, the statement said.  The tweet was sent early on Tuesday in response to a CNN story about the campaign of Donald Trump denying his wife Melanias speech at the Republican Nominating Convention was plagiarized from a 2008 speech by first lady Michelle Obama. CNN is the biggest troll of them all lmao #petty, said the tweet, which was later deleted. The Justice Department said, the tweet does not represent the departments views and was inappropriate for the Department of Justices official account. The Justice Department takes this matter very seriously and will continue to take the appropriate steps to prevent it from happening in the future, said the statement.

Trump's wife seeks to soften his image at raucous Republican convention,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Donald Trumps wife Melania, in her first major political speech on Monday, portrayed her husband as a talented, compassionate and unrelenting leader who would unify rather than divide the country if elected to the White House. The Slovenian-born jewelry designer and former model delivered the speech, part of which strongly resembled an address given by current First Lady Michelle Obama in 2008, to a cheering crowd at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland after a one-minute introduction from Trump.  The presumptive Republican nominee made a dramatic entrance, silhouetted against a white background, to the accompaniment of Queens 1977 rock anthem, We Are the Champions. I have been with Donald for 18 years and I have been aware of his love for this country since we first met, the aspiring first lady told the convention. Hes tough when he has to be, but hes also kind and fair and caring. Donald wants prosperity for all Americans, she said, reading from a teleprompter, as people applauded.  Her roughly 15-minute speech was a bid to soften the image of the New York businessman-turned-politician, who has been accused of bigotry and callousness for his calls to suspend Muslim immigration and deport millions of undocumented immigrants if elected. He has also been criticized for insults directed at women, political opponents and journalists. Part of the text referring to the values held by her family was strikingly similar to a section of Michelle Obamas speech to the Democratic convention in 2008. A Trump campaign official suggested the similarity was the result of an error by her speech writers. In writing her beautiful speech, Melanias team of writers took notes on her lifes inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking, Jason Miller, Trumps senior communications advisor, said in a statement. Trumps Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has accused Trump, 70, of lacking the experience and temperament needed to work in the Oval Office. On Monday, Clinton, 68, used an address to a largely black audience to cast Trump as someone who would divide the country along racial, ethnic and religious lines. The conventions opening night featured a string of emotional speakers attacking Clintons record as secretary of state under President Barack Obama, many arguing she had made Americans vulnerable to Islamist militancy. I blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son, said Pat Smith, the mother of an information management officer who was among the four Americans killed in an attack on a U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, whose administration has been credited with sharply reducing crime in the city during the 1990s and who oversaw the citys response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center and killed almost 3,000 people, gave a highly charged speech slamming Clinton and making the case for Trump. What I did for New York, Donald Trump will do for America! he said. The convention erupted in chaos earlier when Trump opponents inside his party stormed out of the room and others chanted, in a failed attempt to force a vote opposing his candidacy. The turmoil threatened efforts by the Trump campaign to show the party had united behind him and distracted from the days theme of Make America Safe Again. The anti-Trump forces wanted to change the partys nominating rules to allow delegates to support alternative Republican candidates over Trump. Party leaders held a voice vote, then declared the opponents lacked enough support, triggering pandemonium on the floor of the Cleveland basketball arena where Trump is due to be formally nominated this week for the Nov. 8 election. This entire system is rigged to force the vote for Donald Trump, said Kendal Unruh, a delegate from Colorado. While delivering a jolt to the highly scripted program, the rebellion by the anti-Trump forces was quashed. But the furor, an embarrassment to Trump, put a spotlight on the deep divisions within the party that have emerged over his candidacy. A string of senior Republicans, worried about Trumps temperament and policies, were already avoiding the convention.  The gathering opened on Monday afternoon in the shadow of racially tinged killings of police officers and black men, and as protesters for and against Trump faced off in a plaza a few blocks from the convention, shouting slogans at each other, separated by a wall of police. The protests were largely peaceful, with law enforcement officers outnumbering demonstrators.  Sundays shooting of three policemen in Baton Rouge, Louisiana - a targeted attack that may have been retaliation for a series of police killings of black Americans - hung over the gathering. Trump criticized Obama early on Monday over the shootings, saying the Democratic president doesnt have a clue.   The Baton Rouge shootings happened nearly two weeks after police fatally shot a black man there, and after another such death near St. Paul, Minnesota, both of which sparked nationwide protests.  Five policemen were also killed in an ambush in Dallas this month. Trump has sought to position himself as the law-and-order candidate, in an echo of Republican Richard Nixons successful presidential campaign of 1968.

Virginia high court hears Republican voting-rights lawsuit,"RICHMOND, Virginia (Reuters) - In a case that could have an impact on the November presidential election, the Virginia Supreme Court heard arguments on Tuesday over a Republican lawsuit challenging the blanket restoration of voting rights for 206,000 felons by Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe. If upheld, McAuliffes order could help tip Virginia, a swing state where the vote is traditionally close in presidential elections, in favor of presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Lawyers for leaders in the Republican-controlled state legislature argued that McAuliffe exceeded his authority by restoring voting rights en masse, rather than on a case-by-case basis. Never in Virginias 240-year history has a governor exercised clemency power en masse, Charles Cooper, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told the court. Cooper said history and the language of the state constitution clearly indicate that the restoration of a felons rights must be done individually. But Stuart Raphael, Virginias solicitor general, said nothing in the constitution restricts McAuliffes authority to restore such rights across the board, even though no governor has done so in the past. If he has the power, Raphael said, he has the power. The plaintiffs have asked the court to block McAuliffes action, which also allows felons to serve on juries and hold public office. The court did not say on Tuesday when it may issue a decision in the case. Almost 12,000 felons have registered to vote since McAuliffes April 22 executive action, the state elections board said. Many of the convicts benefiting from the order are African-Americans or Latinos, two groups that have voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates in the past. Democrat Barack Obama won Virginia in 2012 by about 150,000 votes and in 2008 by about 235,000 votes.  Before the order, felons had to petition the governor individually to restore their voting rights. Virginia is one of four states whose constitutions permanently disenfranchise felons but allow the governor to restore voting rights, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a non-partisan civil liberties group. McAuliffe and other Democrats have said the restoration of rights to felons who have served their sentences and completed probation is long overdue. The McAuliffe administration has refused to release the names of felons whose rights have been restored, a decision that drew criticism on Tuesday from Justice William Mims. I cannot understand why a document of such importance has been shielded from litigants and the citizens of Virginia, he said. ",politicsNews,"July 19, 2016 ",1
Toxic algae and ice cream party keep top Republicans from Cleveland,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - As Republicans spilled into Cleveland on Monday to nominate Donald Trump as their presidential candidate, 2012 nominee Mitt Romney had an equally crucial task: Entertaining his grandchildren at his lakeside summer house in New Hampshire. U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona, the 2008 Republican nominee who has endorsed Trump despite the latters insults, attended an ice cream party with his wife, Cindy, and volunteers in his re-election campaign in Prescott, Arizona. He also took part in a veterans gathering. Working out of my office in Miami this week, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who dropped out of the Republican presidential race in February, said in an email to Reuters. Bush had been the most active in attacking Trump on the campaign trail and has said he will not be voting for either Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8. His brother, former President George W. Bush and father, former President George H.W. Bush, were also not at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. These are some of the big names from a long list of prominent Republicans who are not venturing this week to Cleveland, where Trump is to be formally nominated on Thursday after a rough-and-tumble Republican primary fight that ripped wounds in the party that have yet to heal. Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort told reporters the convention is a healing time for the party and that Republicans will leave Cleveland united, but he criticized Ohio Governor John Kasich for not participating in an event in his own backyard. And Republicans have moved past the Bush era, he added. Theyre part of the past. Were dealing with the future, he said. Kasich, a one-time rival of Trumps for the nomination, is making the rounds in Cleveland without endorsing Trump or speaking at the convention, a snub that Manafort told NBCs Today show is embarrassing the state of Ohio. Kasich adviser John Weaver shot back: Governor Kasich has made it clear why he hasnt endorsed Mr. Trump. They share a different world view in how to move the country forward. Some of the partys best diverse talent was missing from Cleveland or limiting their participation, including U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Cuban-American, and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, an Indian-American. Many Republicans feel the party is in sore need of more Republicans like Rubio and Haley to appeal to a broader segment of the electorate. As Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus gaveled the convention to order, Rubio was in Fort Myers, Florida, talking about how to tackle toxic algae polluting some of the states waterways. Rubio, who lost to Trump in the primary battle and is running for re-election to the U.S. Senate, is to deliver a short videotaped message to the convention on Wednesday. Haley is to speak at a breakfast for the South Carolina delegation in Cleveland on Wednesday. Chairman Reince Priebus asked if Governor Haley would speak at the convention a couple weeks ago. Governor Haley was grateful for the invitation and looks forward to attending the convention, but, as we have said before, she has no plans to speak so she declined the opportunity, said her deputy chief of staff, Rob Godfrey. Romney, who has been a prominent voice among the anti-Trump forces, was in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, with 36 members of his family for their annual summer gathering, a spokeswoman said. Danny Diaz, who was campaign manager for Jeb Bushs presidential campaign, said the convention is missing a chance to show off some of its most talented Republican politicians. It speaks to where we are as a party at the moment more than anything else, he said.  Former Vice President Dick Cheney was in Wyoming helping the congressional campaign of his daughter, Liz Cheney, and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who was talked about as a possible vice presidential running mate for Trump, was at home in Palo Alto, California. Writing her book about democracy! said her chief of staff, Georgia Godfrey. Some of Trumps former rivals for the nomination are speaking in Cleveland, like U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, former Texas Governor Rick Perry, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee. But some of the others felled by Trump were doing other things. U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, an eye doctor, was providing free eye care in Paducah, Kentucky. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham was in his home state of South Carolina for the week. Republican strategist Ryan Williams said the no-shows are  evidence of a party still deeply fractured, despite the calls for unity. It shows that Trump has more work to do uniting the party and that he should continue to try to bring Republicans together even after the convention, Williams said. ",politicsNews,"July 18, 2016 ",1
"Protesters face off in downtown Cleveland, separated by police","(Reuters) - Protesters for and against Trump faced off in a plaza a few blocks from the site of the Republican National Convention in downtown Cleveland on Monday, shouting slogans at each other but avoiding physical confrontation.  Dozens of protesters were separated by a wall of police that looked equal in number.  To one side of the police line at the foot of the Key Tower, Clevelands tallest building, demonstrators shouted, Black Lives Matter. From the other side came, Youre a bunch of anarchists. The exchanges marked the first emotionally charged demonstration at the 2016 Republican National Convention, where security forces are on alert for potentially disruptive conflicts.  A combination of intense rhetoric by presumptive Republican candidate Donald J. Trump, recent police shootings of African- Americans in Baton Rouge and the Minneapolis area, and the killings of police in Dallas and Baton Rouge has raised tensions in the run-up to the convention.  Alicia Street, 31, a Black Lives Matter activist from Ferguson, Missouri, told Reuters that police appeared to outnumber the protesters. We dont need all these police. This is just free speech, Street said shortly after a group of pro-Trump protesters left the area. They are going to make people afraid. Smaller demonstrations were held elsewhere in the downtown area. At least two protesters were seen carrying firearms. A  group of people identifying themselves as anti-gay Christians shouted at a rival group. One person carried a sign that read, Stop being a sinner and obey Jesus. A speaker at an anti-Trump rally was arrested, but police said it was unrelated to the campaign. One protest leader, Kait McIntyre, 27, said organizers from her group had sought permission for weeks to march outside the protest zone and only recently received it from the city.  We wanted to get within sight and sound of the actual convention. We wanted our voices heard, she said. ",politicsNews,"July 18, 2016 ",1
"U.S. TV networks, amid strong ad sales, boost coverage for Trump's convention","(Reuters) - U.S. TV networks, buoyed by strong demand from advertisers, are adding hours of coverage for this weeks Republican National Convention compared to four years ago and planning to use social media to capture any  unexpected moments, executives said. Presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump may be new to politics. But the former star of his own reality show The Apprentice is a TV veteran who has promised to throw out the traditional convention script and provide a showbiz feel. Adding to the programing uncertainty are protests outside the convention hall in Cleveland and the possibility of dissent among delegates.  Its safe to say that there are going to be surprises, said Sam Feist, Washington bureau chief for CNN, the cable news network owned by Time Warner Inc (TWX.N).   The stakes are high for broadcast and cable networks. Media analysts predict viewership for Trumps acceptance speech could surpass the record 38 million who watched Barack Obama address the Democratic convention in 2008. The potential for the unexpected at what is usually a meticulously staged event is driving strong advertiser demand, network executives said. CNN is pulling in between $40,000 and $100,000 for 30-second spots, a source familiar with the matter said. That is far above the typical cost of roughly $7,000 for a primetime ad on CNN. We are 100 percent sold on primetime and about 95 percent sold on other slots, said Katrina Cukaj, executive vice president of portfolio sales and client partnerships at CNN parent Turner Broadcasting. She declined to comment on rates. Quick service restaurants and movie studios are running more spots than in past conventions, Cukaj said. The advertisers are a lot more diverse than I have ever seen, Cukaj said. Broadcaster CBS (CBS.N) has seen strong ad sales for both conventions and has booked ads from the entertainment, packaged goods, travel and other industries, a network source said. In 2012, TV advertisers spent $5.8 million during both conventions, compared to $7.8 million in 2008, according to Kantar Media. Cable networks will provide coverage throughout each day and into the evening. Broadcast networks plan one hour of primetime coverage each of the four nights, plus online reports. In 2012, broadcasters aired an hour of only the last three nights. CNN will have hundreds of staff on the ground, more than any previous convention, Feist said. For the first time, the channel is anchoring every show from Cleveland through noon Friday. The network will face plenty of competition. Fox News Channel, owned by 21st Century Fox (FOXA.O), began its coverage from Cleveland on Thursday, four days before the start, compared to Sunday in years past. It also added staff outside to cover protests.  Trumps acceptance speech could attract more than 40 million viewers, said Kyle Roberts, president and chief executive of Smart Media Group, a media buyer that works with Republican candidates. Some brands will avoid the convention, said Barry Lowenthal, president of The Media Kitchen, a media buyer. Its just dangerous territory, Lowenthal said. Its very unpredictable content. Im not sure that convention is going to enhance any brands image. Why go there if you can go elsewhere? Media outlets say they will rely more heavily this year on social media and live streams. MSNBC correspondent Jacob Soboroff said he expects to broadcast live most of the week. When not on television, he plans to be on Snapchat, Twitter and possibly Facebook Live. This is going to be a different kind of convention, Soboroff said. It doesnt feel like business as usual because there is a lot of energy around that feels uncertain. Walt Disney Cos (DIS.N) ABC News will run up to six live streams simultaneously on its website and apps. Live coverage from CBS will appear on Twitter and the 24-hour CBSN mobile app. CBS is preparing for the possibility that Trump will appear in some role every night, another break from tradition, CBS News President David Rhodes said.

"For Islamophobia, take two of these and call a Muslim in the morning","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - The normally straight-laced Council on American-Islamic Relations tried humor to win over Republicans at their national convention on Monday, handing out packets of a satirical medicine called Islamophobin, a treatment for Islamophobia. Islamophobin, which is really just chewing gum in a clever package, promises to treat blind intolerance, unthinking bigotry, irrational fear of Muslims, (and) U.S. presidential election year scapegoating. On the first day of the Republican convention to nominate Donald Trump for the Nov. 8 election, CAIR leaders urged the party not to push Muslims voters away. Trump has proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. He opposes letting in refugees from the Syrian war, suggesting some may be militants posing as the downtrodden. He has made claims, unsupported to date, that thousands of Muslims in New Jersey openly cheered the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In an interview broadcast Monday on CNN, Trumps wife Melania, due to speak at the convention later in the day, said of her husband: Hes not racist, hes not anti-immigrant, and added, He wants to keep America safe. CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad urged Republicans instead to court Muslims voters, saying they could be crucial in swing states that decide presidential elections. Too often over the course of this campaign, Republican presidential candidates have pandered to these inner-core Islamophobic leaders and their supporters with proposals like patrolling so-called Muslim neighborhoods, surveilling and shutting down mosques, and openly questioning whether a Muslim can serve as president, Awad said. As a prescription, Awad offered Islamophobin, a concept borrowed from Muslims in Sweden who created a similar product. CAIR sells a package of 12 sugar-free pieces for $1.99 on amazon.com.  The package says: Take two and call a Muslim in the morning. But it comes with a warning. Those who already believe in religious diversity, tolerance and mutual understanding should not use this product, the package says.  Stop taking this product if you begin to develop warm feelings toward Muslims, immigrants or refugees. Nearby at a separate event, Christian demonstrators tried to eclipse a speech by Rose Hamid, a Muslim woman who was ejected from a Trump rally in South Carolina in January for her silent protest, by standing up wearing her head scarf and a T-shirt reading, Salam, I come in peace. As Hamid spoke in favor of a peaceful coexistence at a platform in Public Square set aside for scheduled speeches, the small group behind her hoisted signs such as one saying, Muhammad is a liar, false-prophet, child-raping pervert. When they tried to drown out Hamid with a bullhorn, she turned around to see them for the first time and remarked, Oh, theyre lovely. Police then removed them from the scene for demonstrating without a permit. ",politicsNews,"July 18, 2016 ",1
Republican 2016 platform calls for reinstating 1933 banking law,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - The U.S. Republican Party on Monday approved a new policy platform that calls for reinstating the 1933 Glass-Steagall law requiring the separation of commercial and investment banking, an addition White House hopeful Donald Trumps campaign said it backed. Trump, who will formally accept the Republican presidential nomination in Cleveland this week, has vowed to dismantle most of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that was passed under President Barack Obama following the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The language in the Republican platform offered further details on Trumps regulatory policies. Trump, who has sought to cast himself as a populist, has accused presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton of being too close to Wall Street. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, signed the legislation that repealed Glass-Steagall in 1999. The Obama-Clinton years have passed legislation that has been favorable to the big banks, which is why you see all the Wall Street money going to her, Paul Manafort, Trumps campaign manager, told reporters on Monday. They know shes their champion, and they are supporting her fully. Some U.S. lawmakers in both parties support a modern Glass-Steagall to keep banks from becoming too big to fail, or so big their collapse would destabilize the financial system. The Democratic Partys 2016 platform, which has not been approved, calls for an updated version.  Republicans universally despise Dodd-Frank, which their platform calls Democrats legislative Godzilla. But senior congressional Republicans back other alternatives. Glass-Steagall is dumb politics and dumb economics, said Tony Fratto, who worked in the administration of Republican President George W. Bush. Returning to Glass-Steagall would be destructive and unworkable. Clinton has said she would break up banks based on risk, not size, and frequently focuses on the risks posed by non-bank institutions. Manafort listed the Glass-Steagall language among platform points he said reflect the issues that Mr. Trump has raised during the course of the campaign, including building a wall at the border with Mexico and calling for tougher trade deals. The platform also calls for control of national parks and other lands to be handed over to states, an effort by the partys conservative wing that got national attention during a 2014 standoff involving a Nevada cattle rancher.

Presidential candidate Clinton promises to prosecute police killers,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton promised on Monday to bring the full weight of the law against people who kill police officers if she becomes the next U.S. president after two recent episodes of gunmen slaying police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate ahead of a Nov. 8 election, made the promise in a speech in Cincinnati at the annual convention of the civil rights group the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Anyone who kills a police officer and anyone who helps must be held accountable, Clinton said. As president, I will bring the full weight of the law to bear to make sure those who kill police officers are brought to justice.  The penalties for killing a police officer are rightly more severe than those for killing a civilian because police are symbols of the rule of law, she said. Clintons remarks come among heighten tensions between police forces and many black and Latino Americans, who have been rallying in protests across the country against a spate of police killings of black men, often unarmed, during encounters. A black former soldier killed five police officers during one such protest in Dallas, Texas, on July 7. On Sunday, another black former U.S. Marine sergeant killed three police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  ",politicsNews,"July 18, 2016 ",1
U.S. police deaths build momentum for law to treat attacks as hate crimes,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When the U.S. Congress returns in September from a summer recess, it is expected to consider legislation called the Blue Lives Matter Act that would make killing a police officer a hate crime, a step first taken by Louisiana earlier this year.  Debate in Louisiana over the law enacted in May pitted police unions, which supported tougher hate-crime sentences for police assailants, against civil rights groups, which felt police did not face the historic discrimination hate-crime laws were intended to address.  The Louisiana debate could play out on a national stage with the Blue Lives Matter Act as police shooting deaths this month in Dallas and Baton Rouge stoke momentum for action to combat violence against police and build support for the law.  Since the Baton Rouge tragedy, weve received calls and messages from around the country from individuals asking about the Blue Lives Matter Act, and were confident more members of Congress will be co-sponsoring the legislation as soon as they can when Congress reconvenes, said Kyle Huwa, a spokesman for the bills author, Colorado Republican Representative Ken Buck.  Sixteen Republicans in the House of Representatives are co-sponsoring the bill, which was introduced in March and has failed to gain Democratic support. Its title plays off the Black Lives Matter movement that arose in protest against police use of force against minorities, especially black men, and deaths of minorities at the hands of police in recent years.  Fraternal Order of Police Executive Director Jim Pasco said he has in private meetings urged President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Attorney General Loretta Lynch to protect police under the federal hate crime statute.  That law covers violence motivated by bias against a victims race, gender, national origin, religion or sexual orientation and imposes harsher penalties as a deterrent. But Pasco said he received no confirmation such a move would be supported by the administration. The Justice Department and the White House declined to comment on their positions.  In the shooting deaths of three police officers in Baton Rouge on Sunday, Louisiana prosecutors would have been able to seek hate crime penalties against gunman Gavin Long if he had survived. Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a Washington based advocacy group, said many states have increased penalties for assaults against police and police deaths have been declining. Police shootings overall have been down in recent years. Preliminary Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics released Monday show 41 law enforcement officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2015. That was down almost 20 percent from 51 officers killed in 2014. We should not use this as a moment to dilute the unique problem of long standing discrimination and violence directed toward groups on the basis of race in our country, Clarke said.

Obama administration asks Supreme Court to rehear immigration case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a last-ditch effort to revive a White House plan to protect up to 4 million immigrants from deportation, the Obama administration on Monday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to rehear a case on which the eight-member court was split 4-4 last month. The June 23 high court decision left in place a lower court ruling that blocked the plan, which has never been in effect. The court is currently one justice short following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February. In a filing, the Justice Department asked the court to take a second look at the case once it has a full complement of nine justices. It is unclear when that would be, as the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate has declined to act on Obamas nominee, appeals court judge Merrick Garland. As such, even if the Supreme Court was to grant the request, it is unlikely to rule on the case until well after Obama leaves office in January. Acknowledging that the high court rarely rehears cases, Acting Solicitor General Ian Gershengorn said the immigration case is unique because the court could not in future take another case to resolve the issue if the plan is blocked. The high court should be the final arbiter of these matters through a definitive ruling, he wrote. Obama unveiled his plan in November 2014. It was quickly challenged in court by Republican-governed Texas and 25 other states that argued that Obama overstepped the powers granted to him by the U.S. Constitution by infringing upon the authority of Congress. Because we are right on the law, we have prevailed at every stage in this case, and we are confident that we will continue to prevail, said Marc Rylander, a spokesman for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.  As a result of the high courts 4-4 split, a 2015 lower-court ruling invalidating Obamas plan was left in place. The plan never was implemented because the lower courts had blocked it. The plan was tailored to let roughly 4 million people - those who have lived illegally in the United States at least since 2010, have no criminal record and have children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents - get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits. Obama took the action after Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives killed bipartisan immigration legislation that was passed by the Senate in 2013. ",politicsNews,"July 18, 2016 ",1
Republican convention in turmoil as anti-Trump delegates protest,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - The Republican National Convention was in an uproar on Monday after opponents of presumptive U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump failed in their effort to hold a roll-call vote in opposition to his candidacy. The anti-Trump forces at the Cleveland convention started shouting Roll Call after the party leaders approved by acclamation rules at the start of the convention that barred them from registering their opposition. Party leaders declared there was insufficient support to allow for a roll-call vote that would record the number of delegates opposed to Trump, a New York businessman who has never held political office and has struggled to win over many mainstream Republicans. Some delegates walked out of the convention in protest at the leaders ruling while others chanted loudly, demanding a roll-call vote take place. Trump last week declared the so-called Never Trump movement dead, tweeting that #NeverTrump is never more. ",politicsNews,"July 18, 2016 ",1
"After Brexit, Kerry pays tribute to EU achievements","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry paid tribute to the European Union on Monday as it tries to heal the wound of Britains vote to leave, saying detractors were overlooking what it had achieved in alliance with America. I ask anyone who questions the importance of the EU or its relationship with the United States, (to consider) not just the history that I articulated, but the increase of prosperity, the rise in the standard of living ... the better protection of rights for individuals in the EU, as a consequence of what we have done together, Kerry said in Brussels. He was speaking at a joint news conference with EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini after a meeting with his European counterparts including Boris Johnson, Britains new foreign minister, who led the Leave campaign. His comments sounded like a jab at presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who last month forecast the break-up of the EU due to fears over immigration, and at Johnson, who during the campaign compared the EUs ambitions with those of Hitler and Napoleon. Kerry, a Democrat, spoke of the close ties between the United States and European Union dating back to the U.S. role in freeing Europe from Nazism in World War Two. But he acknowledged that such memories were fading.  Theres a whole separation of time which has changed attitudes of some people, he said, adding that in the face of common threats such as Islamist militancy, the EU-U.S. partnership was as important as it has ever been. Mogherini responded that it sometimes took a clear-sighted transatlantic view to put Europes value into perspective. I would like to thank you personally, and through you the U.S. administration of President Obama for the strong message and clear message that we always hear from you on the need for a strong and united Europe, she said.  Sometimes we need our closest friends, our best friends, to remind us of the extraordinary value of the European Union. ",politicsNews,"July 18, 2016 ",1

U.S. shootings heighten security concerns at Republican convention,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Clevelands police union called for the suspension of a state law allowing people to carry firearms during the Republican National Convention but Ohios governor said he was powerless to act despite heightened security concerns with the killing on Sunday of three police officers in Louisiana.  Republican Donald Trump seized on the shooting deaths in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to bolster his case the United States is leaderless and he is the better candidate in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election to restore law and order than his rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton. It was not immediately clear there was a link between Sundays shootings and recent unrest countrywide over police killings of black men, one of them a shooting in Baton Rouge about two weeks ago. Despite a lack of clarity about the motive and specifics of Sundays incident, Trump said President Barack Obama doesnt have a clue on how to handle the problem after Obama voiced concern about inflammatory rhetoric on the campaign trail.  Our country is a divided crime scene, and it will only get worse! Trump said. He issued statements on Twitter on Sunday, a day before the start of the four-day Republican Convention in Cleveland this week due to formally nominate him for the White House. After the shootings in Baton Rouge, in which three other police officers were wounded, the head of Clevelands police union, Steve Loomis, asked Governor John Kasich to suspend state laws allowing people to openly carry firearms, but Kasich said he lacked the authority to do so. Kasich, a Republican who lost his bid for the White House to Trump, issued a statement through his spokeswoman Emmalee Kalmbach, saying: Ohio governors do not have the power to arbitrarily suspend federal and state constitutional rights or state laws as suggested. The bonds between our communities and police must be reset and rebuilt - as were doing in Ohio - so our communities and officers can both be safe. Clinton called the shootings devastating and urged the country to work together. We must not turn our backs on each other. We must not be indifferent to each other, Clinton said in a statement. We must all stand together to reject violence and strengthen our communities. Speaking at the White House, Obama said that with this weeks Republican convention followed next week by the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, political rhetoric would likely be more overheated than usual. We dont need inflammatory rhetoric, we dont need careless accusations thrown around to score political points or to advance an agenda. We need to temper our words and open our hearts, all of us, Obama told reporters. There were no plans to delay Mondays start of the Cleveland convention, where thousands of Republican delegates are gathering amid a threat of protests both for and against Trump, 70, a businessman-turned-candidate. Security was extraordinarily tight with downtown streets lined by concrete traffic dividers and tall metal fences, propelled by a new urgency after an attacker drove his truck into a holiday crowd in Nice, France, last week, killing 84 people. Jeff Larson, chief executive officer of the convention, said he was not worried about the open carry law. Theres going to be plenty of law enforcement in downtown Cleveland, he told reporters. I feel good about the security and what weve done. Trump sought to link the violence to the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State, writing: We are TRYING to fight ISIS, and now our own people are killing our police. Our country is divided and out of control. The world is watching. Trump enters the crucial week trailing Clinton in most national opinion polls and needs a bounce from the convention to vault him into a more competitive position. Republican strategist Hogan Gidley said the violence gave relevance to Trumps message. Its something that Donald Trump and his crowd were already prepared to talk about, he said. This is an epidemic in this country now and weve got to solve it. Democratic strategist David Axelrod tweeted that Trumps effort to make himself a law-and-order candidate reminded him of a similar attempt by Richard Nixon in 1968, when the Republican won his first presidential election. Someones been studying 68, Axelrod tweeted. Trumps goal at the convention is to get more American voters to take a fresh look at him and, he hopes, to see him in a more favorable light, after his victory over 16 other Republican candidates in a brutal battle marked by insults and inflammatory rhetoric that left many in the party divided. To that end, many speakers will talk about their views on Trump, from daughter Ivanka to womens pro golfer Natalie Gulbis.Its going to be a very personal convention. I mean, youre going to have his family speaking. Youre going to have friends who have known him speaking, Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort told CBSs Face the Nation. Many longtime party fixtures are staying away. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has been a private counselor to Trump, said the convention would help Trump pivot to the general election. Hes never run for anything before. ... I think its just taken longer to pivot, and I think hes pivoting, Priebus told NBCs Meet the Press.  The convention will also provide Republican faithful with their first look at his vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, who was announced on Saturday after a messy selection process. Hoping to win over more traditional Republicans, Trump picked the social conservative Pence over two other finalists, former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. The disorganized nature of the running mate rollout - in which Trump failed to fully project the power of the partnership  - had some Republicans worried that they could see more of the same at Cleveland.

Art of the spin: Trump bankers question his portrayal of financial comeback,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump, who often says he only likes winners, tells one grand tale of loss: In 1990, he nearly went bankrupt and was forced to ask dozens of banks to whom he owed money to change the terms on their loans and forgive some of his debts. It was, the real estate developer admits in his 1997 book The Art of the Comeback, the darkest period of his professional life. In his telling, its a story of redemption, of resilience, and proof of his exceptional negotiating skills and shrewd thinking. Six people who participated in the loan workout negotiations have a different recollection, raising questions about a key part of the personal narrative that many of Trumps supporters have found compelling as he campaigns to be the next president of the United States on Nov. 8. On the campaign trail he has portrayed himself as a survivor and a master negotiator. Trump says his comeback began when he recognized a downturn in the real estate market and quickly asked banks to renegotiate his loans. That decision was perhaps the smartest thing I did, he wrote. The six bankers and lawyers involved in the talks say the bailout wasnt based on any overture Trump initiated with the banks - and the terms of the deal were dictated by what was best for the banks, not Trump.  Three of the participants say Trump didnt acknowledge he had a problem until his lenders reviewed his books, realized he was on the brink of collapse, and summoned him for debt restructuring talks.  While much has been written about Trumps financial troubles at the time, there has been little examination of his description of the bank negotiations in The Art of the Comeback, including his assertion that he chose to initiate those talks. Trumps spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, declined to comment for this story. Following the U.S. stock market crash of 1987, a global recession hit New York real estate. New construction stalled, and several big developers declared bankruptcy.  As the real estate market slumped, Trump ran out of cash. At the beginning of 1990 he owed a combined $4 billion tomore than 70 banks, with $800 million personally guaranteed by his own assets, according to Alan Pomerantz, a lawyer whose team led negotiations between Trump and 72 banks to restructure Trumps loans. Pomerantz was hired by Citibank but became lead counsel for the negotiations. At the time, Trump was not considered a major developer, but he was a New York celebrity. His affair with the actress Marla Maples and his divorce from his first wife Ivana Trump made national news headlines, and his first book, The Art of the Deal, was a bestseller. He didnt have a large portfolio of real estate in New York, with the notable exceptions of his 5th Avenue building, Trump Tower, completed in1983, and the PlazaHotel, which he bought in 1988 after borrowing heavily from Citibank. He also owned three casinos in Atlantic City, having made a financial bet that he could revive the East Coast gambling destination. And in 1989 headded part of an airline to his portfolio, again turning to Citibank for a loan to help finance the acquisition of bankruptEastern Airlines Shuttle. He turned it into Trump Shuttle. In 1989, in response to growing concerns about the economic downturn,the Federal Reserve began asking big banks to review their exposure to the sinking real estate market. At the beginning of 1990, a credit specialist at one of Trumps biggest lenders decided to take a look at the banks book of loans to him. The decision was prompted in part by the Feds questions, as well as concerns within the bank about its exposure to the real estate market. The credit specialist,who did not want to be identified, concluded at the time that Trump was about to go into bankruptcy. The banks were onto the problem before he was onto the problem, the specialist told Reuters. Pomerantz said some of the banks became aware of the magnitude of Trumps financial problems when, on a single day, he drew down every cent of a $100 million line of credit one of the banks, Bankers Trust, which was purchased by Deutsche Bank in 1999, had given him to meet his obligations. Reuters was unable to independently confirm this. He did not come to the banks and say I have a problem. That did not happen, said Pomerantz. Pomerantz, who says he is not a member of any political party, argued in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal that Trumps record in real estate was not a good way to measure whether or not he would be a good president.  In The Art of the Comeback, Trump says he began loan workout talks in March 1990 when he informed his bankers he might miss a payment on his casino debts.  If I had waited just six months longer to renegotiate terms with the banks, I might have lost everything, he wrote. I would have had to stand in line with a whole bunch of other moguls who were trying to do the same thing. Soon, in boardrooms of banks and law firms around Manhattan, Trumps deputies and lawyers began a series of meetings with representatives of the 72 banks, which had billions in outstanding loans, according to Pomerantz. During the same period, Trump was separately renegotiating a series of loans on his Atlantic City casinos. One of the bankers involved in those negotiations, Ben Berzin, said Trump seemed unaware of the depths of his financial troubles even after the banks had stepped in.  There was a period during these negotiations when he was still spending money like a drunken sailor, Berzin said, recalling the uproar among the bankers when, in a TV interview in the summer of 1991, Trump displayed a large diamond engagement ring he had given Maples. Media reports said the ring cost $250,000, and Pomerantz said the bankers complained about it to Trump in their next meeting. At one point, Trump invitedall of the bankers to a Broadway show that Maples had a role in, accordingto Berzin and a banker who took part in the larger talks with the 72 banks.Both said they believed Trump was trying to curry favor towin better terms in the workouts. Berzin attended the show but the other banker did not. Trump described Berzin in The Art of the Comeback as a jerk who would scream at people at the top of his lungs about nonsense. Berzin said he was irritated by Trumps characterization and denied ever raising his voice in a meeting. In his book, Trump says he told representatives of the 72 banks he would declare bankruptcy and tie you guys up for years in the proceedings unless they staked him $65 million to keep his businesses running until the real estate market recovered. He also wanted them to agree to defer all loan payments until that time.   The banks more than capitulated - they enthusiastically agreed to my proposal, Trump wrote. The bankers and lawyers interviewed dispute this. Though it was true that a personal bankruptcy would have made it harder for the banks to collect what Trump owed them, he had little leverage in the talks, they said. He, too, would have been seriously hurt in a bankruptcy, especially since he had personally guaranteed so much of what he had borrowed. In Pomerantzs analysis, he would have been able to hold on to little else beyond his home and his pension plan. During the 18-month process of negotiations and asset sales, Trump also asked for more time to develop his business ideas, like his plan to turn hotel rooms at the Plaza Hotel into condominiums, according to one of the bankers, who declined to be identified. That proposal was vetoed. While he did receive a $450,000-a-month allowance from the banks to keep his business operations going, it was structured and executed on the banks terms, several of the negotiators said. The banksdecided they could recover more of the $4 billion they were collectively owed if they sold Trumps holdings one by one, waiting until the market recovered, rather than taking possession of the assets, four participants in the talks said.  These individuals said the banks agreed to forgive Trumps personal liabilities in exchange for his help in selling the properties. The proceeds of the sales would then be split among the banks. Trump agreed that the banks could take away all his personal property, including his beloved Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, if he failed to execute the agreement. We had to be sure he would pay attention, Pomerantz said of the liens on Trumps personal holdings.We would meet with him everyFriday morning. He was under very strict restrictions by the banks.  Trump worked with the bankers to sell his assets, even when he disagreed about the timing of the sales, most notably when Citibank eventually sold The Plaza. The banks did not recover 100 percent of what they were owed and several lenders vowed never to work with Trump again. ",politicsNews,"July 17, 2016 ",1

Exclusive: U.S. curtails federal election observers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal election observers can only be sent to five states in this years U.S. presidential election, among the smallest deployments since the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965 to end racial discrimination at the ballot box. The plan, confirmed in a U.S. Department of Justice fact sheet seen by Reuters, reflects changes brought about by the Supreme Courts 2013 decision to strike down parts of the Act, a signature legislative achievement of the 1960s civil rights movement. Voting rights advocates told Reuters they were concerned that the scaling-back of observers would make it harder to detect and counter efforts to intimidate or hinder voters, especially in southern states with a history of racial discrimination at the ballot box. The Supreme Court ruling undercut a key section of the Act that requires such states to obtain U.S. approval before changing election laws. The court struck down the formula used to determine which states were affected. By doing so, it ended the Justice Departments ability to select voting areas it deemed at risk of racial discrimination and deploy observers there, the fact sheet said. Eleven mostly Southern states had been certified as needing federal observers by the department. Federal observers can still be sent to monitor elections but only when authorized by federal court rulings. Currently, courts have done so in five states:Alabama, Alaska, California, Louisiana, and New York, according to the Justice Department. A Justice Department spokesmandeclined to comment on the fact sheet or say how many people will be deployed to monitor voting until closer to the Nov. 8 election pitting Republican Donald Trump against Democrat Hillary Clinton. In recent presidential elections, the Justice Department has sent more than 780 people to watch elections around the country. They were split into three categories. The Supreme Court ruling reduced that to two, according to the document. One category is Justice Department staff, who have no statutory authority to access polling sites but still monitor voting nationwide. They must rely on local and state authorities to grant them access to polling locations. A second group are federal observers trained by the Office of Personnel Management with unfettered access to polling sites. They are only deployed by federal court order. A third group  which the document said has been eliminated by the Supreme Court decision  are federal observers deployed to jurisdictions that the attorney general selected based onevidence of possible racial discrimination. They were also trained by the Office of Personnel Management and had full access to polling sites. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Friday the Justice Departments ability to deploy election observers had been severely curtailed by the Supreme Courts decision. Since Congress passed the 1965 Act, federal observers have gathered evidence of unlawful activity and prepared reports from polling sites that can be used as evidence in court. In the November 2004 presidential election, the last for which the Justice Department provided numbers of federal observers, about 840 federal observers and more than 250 department personnel were dispatched to polling sites in 86 jurisdictions in 25 states. The mix of tools has shifted, said Justin Levitt, who oversees the Justice Departments voting section. The department still has the ability to send in personnel and take legal action against election officials where necessary, he said in an interview. But Justice Department staff who monitor elections have significantly less authority than federal observers. At any point on Election Day, Justice Department staff can be denied entry to a voting area or asked to leave, unlike a federal observer. That could make it more difficult to gather evidence of voting problems and potentially make it harder to prosecute cases of suppression, say voting rights advocates. Suppression can take a number of forms, such as intimidating or misinforming voters, or denying them access to voting materials in their own language. Relying on Justice Department personnel to monitor elections is a far cry from federal observers who are statutorily authorized to be inside the polling place, said Gerry Hebert, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based non-profit Campaign Legal Center. Hebert, a former senior Justice Department voting rights official, oversaw teams of federal observers in the U.S. South before leaving the department in 1994. Federal observer reports have been cited in court cases by groups alleging voter fraud. In Sandoval County, New Mexico, federal observer reports showed that Native-American voters had difficulty getting voting information in their native languages during the decade between 1994 and 2004, according to a 2011 court order in a case the United States brought against the county. Dale Ho, director of the American Civil Liberties Unions Voting Rights Project, said federal observers are especially needed this year because 17 states have tightened restrictions on voting since the last presidential election. Were very disappointed by the decision of the Justice Department, said Ho. The Supreme Court ruling did not mention the federal observer program specifically, so I dont think this decision was inevitable, he added. Anita Earls, the executive director of the Southern Coalition for Social Justice and a former senior official in the Justice Departments voting section, said the guaranteed ability of federal observers to examine voter registration rolls and remain inside polling stations makes them more effective than Justice Department staff at catching voter suppression.

"A festival air, and unease, hang over pre-convention Cleveland","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - East 4th Street, emblematic of the new Cleveland as a once-downtrodden area turned trendy, is bustling ahead of the Republican National Convention. Outdoor diners on the cobblestone restaurant row enjoy a glorious summer afternoon while cable network MSNBC shoots its politically themed shows on the street.  Just ahead of the four-day convention that starts on Monday, a festival of commerce and smiling faces takes place a few steps from the so-called hard zone, delineated by a literal iron curtain that surrounds the sports arena where Donald Trump will be crowned the Republican presidential candidate. Ten years ago, this place was a dump. A wasteland, said John Lusk, 70, a semiretired publisher of a newsletter. A group of young, hardworking entrepreneurs came in and look what they did.    The sunny celebration butts uncomfortably against a massive security operation that shows the other side of Clevelands big moment. City and U.S. officials are preparing for the worst, aware that tensions over race relations and police use of force, as well as reaction to Trumps polarizing campaign, could result in violence on the streets. Clevelanders are also aware of the backdrop for their convention: the mass shooting in Orlando that killed 50 people in June, the sniper attack that killed five Dallas police this month, and the truck assault that killed 84 this week in Nice. On this same idyllic block just over a year ago, police in riot gear clashed with demonstrators reacting to the acquittal of police officer charged with manslaughter for firing 15 rounds into the car of an unarmed black man and woman, killing them both. More than 70 people were arrested, disturbing the al fresco dining experience on East 4th Street. Unrest also followed the fatal police shooting in 2014 of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, an African-American who had a toy gun, and the officer who shot him was not charged with a crime. Cleveland, a city of 390,000, has been revitalized in part by billions of dollars in infrastructure spending in recent years, but the black majority still lags behind. Black Lives Matter, the protest group formed after a series of police killings of African-Americans raised questions about justice in America, held a protest on Saturday in Public Square. It was entirely peaceful, with about 100 activists clapping to speeches. In between the civic protest and festival atmosphere, there are pockets of emptiness. Street closing and security cordons seem to have scared off customers at the Arcade, a late 1800s shopping mall that has been modernized. The ornate interior, illuminated by a skylight, is full of boutiques like Prosperity, which sells handcrafted art glass jewelry. Business is slow on a Saturday afternoon. A lot of people are afraid to come downtown, said Cat Zurchin, one of the artist/storeowners, from an empty shop.   Some of these stores opened up just for the convention. Retail people have been excited, but we also have some anxiety. The Secret Service is everywhere. Black SUVs have invaded the city center as the U.S. Secret Service has taken charge of security. Concrete median barriers and the tall, anti-scaling fence circumscribe the city into impenetrable sectors. A column of police ride through the city center on bicycles, a dozen more on horseback. Helicopters clatter overhead.  Cleveland police are trying to stay restrained, avoiding the militarized presence that has become common thanks to free war surplus equipment from the Pentagon. Even so, the citys courts are preparing to process up to 1,000 arrestees per day, ready to stay open 20 hours a day.  Hospitals are bracing for the worst. The Cleveland Clinic, one of the largest hospitals in the country, will have 50 doctors, nurses and other medical personnel at the convention site and its entire staff on standby. If needed the hospital can take over an adjoining hotel and conference center, enabling it to handle 1,000 general trauma cases. The hospital is prepared to operate without reinforcements for 96 hours. All boots on the ground, said Dr. Robert Willie, chief of medical operations.     Likewise, the Secret Service says it can handle the spotlight. We are prepared, said Ronald Rowe, the agent in charge of the convention, and ready to welcome the world to Cleveland.

Can Pence's vow not to sling mud survive a Trump campaign?,"(Reuters) - In 1990, during a close and bitter congressional race, Mike Pence came under attack for using campaign funds to pay for personal expenses, including his mortgage and credit card bills. The expenditures were not illegal at the time, but proved difficult to explain for a candidate who had railed about the outsized role of money in politics. Pence in turn blasted his opponent with attack ads, including one featuring a man in traditional Arab clothing who thanked Pences opponent in thickly accented English for policies that benefited Middle Eastern oil producers. The commercial was attacked by Arab-American groups, and the Indianapolis Star called it one of the two worst campaign commercials that year. Pence, who is now Indianas governor and was selected this week to be Donald Trumps presidential running mate, lost his 1990 race, but what he regretted more than losing, he later said, was his decision to sling mud. In the 25 years since that loss, Pences political allies and enemies alike say he has steered clear of personal attacks. This could prove challenging when campaigning with Trump, who enthusiastically tears into his rivals.  Pences style is likely to cast him in a very different role from that of traditional vice presidential candidates, who often throw and take punches to allow presidential contenders to remain above the fray. In the case of Trump and Pence, said Indianapolis University Professor Laura Merrifield Albright, the roles are likely to be reversed. Its a different dynamic. Its tough to imagine anyone out-trumping Trump, she said, noting that he is willing to do his own dirty work. Michael Totten, a retired architect who worked on Pences 1990 campaign, thinks the two candidates will complement one another. He dubbed Pence the perfect No. 2, a running mate who can temper some of Trumps enthusiasm and be the calming voice. Neither Pence nor the Trump campaign immediately responded to a request for comment. After losing his 1990 race, Pence apologized to his opponent for the oil advertisement.  He later told his colleague at a conservative think tank, William Styring, that he regretted the tone of the campaign. I really screwed up on this. Its not me, Styring recalled Pence as saying.  In 1991, Pence wrote an apologetic article for the think tanks policy journal, titled Confessions of a Negative Campaigner. After the defeat, Pence did not seek public office again for a decade. He worked at the Indiana Policy Review and hosted his own statewide conservative radio talk show, describing himself as Rush Limbaugh on decaf.He also hosted a morning TV show in Indianapolis from 1995 to 1999. In 2000, Pence again ran for a U.S. House of Representatives seat, this time successfully. And he demonstrated that his 1990 mea culpa was more than just political theater, observers of Indiana politics say. His opponents in campaigns after he re-entered politics describe him as extremely disciplined and cordial. Melina Fox, Pences Democratic challenger in 2002, said that his statements in the race were calculated and thought-out. Democrat Barry Welsh, who ran against him in 2006, 2008 and 2010, said Pence was invariably polite, professional and gentlemanly.  But some question how he will cope with being constantly challenged in a hard-fought presidential race. He seems uncomfortable with difficult questions and does not take counterpunches very well, said Rebecca Pearcey, who ran the losing campaign of Pences opponent in the 2012 race for Indiana governor, Democrat John Gregg.He doesnt engage. He operates as though the opponent is not there.  Before being picked as Trumps running mate, Pence was poised for a tight rematch race against Gregg. In recent months, Pences approval rating had fallen below 50 percent, in part because of controversy surrounding the states Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which held that a governmental entity may not substantially burden a persons exercise of religion. Pence first alienated liberals and moderates by signing the bill into law. He then outraged the measures evangelical supporters by endorsing changes to the law aimed at preventing discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. The 2016 gubernatorial campaign had started to become more negative, with yard signs calling for Pence to be fired. The Republican Governors Association ran an independently produced ad that attacked his opponents record. But Pence himself had not gone negative. At a Saturday morning event to formally introduce his running mate, Trump called Pence a man of honor, contrasting him with Hillary Clinton, whom he described as the embodiment of corruption. It remains to be seen how aggressive Pence will be in campaigning for Trump in coming months - and whether he will stick to the principles outlined in his 1991 article on negative campaigning. It is wrong, quite simply, he wrote at the time, to squander a candidates priceless moment in history ... on partisan bickering.  In an interview with CBS correspondent Lesley Stahl that will air on 60 Minutes on Sunday evening, Trump suggested he may not expect his running mate to go on the attack.   While discussing his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, Trump told Stahl, I call her Crooked Hillary ... but I dont think he should do it, because its different for him.

"In circuitous speech, Trump touts VP pick Pence as man to unify party","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. presidential hopeful Donald Trump on Saturday presented his vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, as the man who can unify a fractured Republican party and help him bridge the gap created by the candidates outsider status. In a wide-ranging speech in which he touted his own landslide victory in the Republican primaries, Trump cast Pence as a perfect complement for the White House: a veteran of government, a man with a Midwestern sensibility and strong Republican credentials as a job creator and budget balancer.   Indiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice, Ive admired the work hes done, especially in the state of Indiana, Trump said at an event in New York City.  And one of the reasons is party unity, so many people have said, party unity. Because Im an outsider, he added in explaining his decision. Trump and Pence made their debut just two days before the beginning of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where delegates from around the country will convene to officially nominate the pair as their partys ticket for the Nov. 8 election. Frequently straying from the notes on the lectern, Trump talked about himself and likely Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, often detouring from the purpose of the event: to introduce a little-known politician to the broader public. Back to Mike Pence, Trump said, interrupting himself during a lengthy explanation about why evangelical voters support his candidacy. He then read a series of statistics highlighting the job growth in Indiana.     He looks very good, added the New York real estate mogul, who is known to comment openly on peoples appearances.   Trump had a bit of a winding path to settle on Pence, a devout Christian and conservative. He postponed his planned Friday announcement after the deadly attack in Nice, France and saying he had not made his final, final decision, Trump privately had second thoughts on who to pick in late-night conversations on Thursday, said a Republican source familiar with the situation. Trump had been annoyed that the element of surprise had been taken away by the leaking of Pences name, the source added. Trump ended up announcing Pence as his running mate on Twitter on Friday.  Saturdays event in a New York City hotel ballroom had few of the traditional hallmarks of what is arguably one of the most important decisions for a presidential candidate. Before it started, supporters listened to the Rolling Stones song You Cant Always Get What You Want, a tune in regular rotation at Trump events. There were no Trump Pence signs distributed to the crowd or adorning the room. The two appeared together on stage only briefly - each standing out of view while the other one spoke.  On stage, they made scant eye contact and shook hands rather than raising arms together in the classic pose of running mates. Neither offered anecdotal stories about their private time together.       Pence, in sharp contrast to Trump, delivered a prepared speech, discussing the love of his wife and country and his adoration for Ronald Reagan. He gave a full-throated call to fellow Republicans to back Trump. Lets come together as a party, as a people, as a movement, to make America great again and that day begins when Donald Trump becomes the 45th president of the United States of America, Pence said. Trump has struggled to bridge the gap between himself and the establishment and conservative wings of the party. The drastically different styles highlighted Pences ability to provide a complementing tone to the presidential ticket.     Its unclear when the two will appear together again. Pence heads back to Indiana for a solo event on Saturday night, and the Trump campaign hasnt released a schedule for the convention that would include a joint appearance. The pair recorded an interview with CBSs 60 Minutes that is scheduled to air on Sunday night.         One of their big challenges will be to brook their policy differences in public. Pence gave a nod to that by saying strong Republican leadership can bring about real change. Trump has made renegotiating trade deals a central theme of his campaign, while Pence has spoken in favor of trade agreements. In an appearance on Friday night on Fox News, Pence offered a moderated take on trade, saying he agrees with Trump that deals should be renegotiated.  He also softened his vocal opposition to Trumps call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.      I am very supportive of Donald Trumps call to temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represents a threat to the United States, Pence told conservative Fox News commentator Sean Hannity. Pence added that he supports Trumps call for building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. ",politicsNews,"July 16, 2016 ",1
A kiss is not just a kiss on Cleveland convention billboards,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - In an age of social media and sound bites, advocacy groups in Cleveland have turned to the old-fashioned medium of billboards to display messages during the Republican National Convention, from the serious to the ridiculous and shocking. Among them is an artists fanciful rendering of Donald Trump about to kiss former rival Ted Cruz, a poke at a Republican Party platform that would limit gay rights, the signs sponsor said.  Love Trumps Hate. End Homophobia, reads the billboard featuring Trump and Cruz moving in for a lip-lock.  Elsewhere in Cleveland, there are also chestnuts such as Dont Trust the Liberal Media, and the eternally contentious issue of abortion is the focus of another that says, How much time will we serve - when the RNC platform makes abortion illegal? Some 50,000 visitors are expected in Cleveland for the convention that runs from Monday to Thursday. There Trump, who has selected Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate, is expected to officially accept the Republican nomination for president. With so many party insiders, activists, lobbyists and reporters descending on Cleveland, political groups have chosen a direct path to their eyeballs. Dont Trust the Liberal Media, paid for by the Media Research Center, stands beside a highway near the airport and is repeated at least twice more in central Cleveland, where the convention will take place. Six strategically placed signs around the city depict a group of women in a police-style lineup. The message, sponsored by the National Institute of Reproductive Health, which supports abortion rights, is intended to bring attention to recently passed state laws seeking to limit access to abortion.  We wanted to use the RNC to raise awareness with the public. We wanted to give the public the facts about what is happening and the laws on the books being quietly passed behind the scenes and the logical conclusion that those laws will put women in jail, said Andrea Miller, president of the institute. The Trump-Cruz makeout illustration resembles images of unstated political motives depicting Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that went up in Lithuania and another in Bristol, England, that showed Trump bussing British politician Boris Johnson.  The Cleveland sign was paid for by Planting Peace, a group favoring equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Planting Peace calls for the immediate change in the Republican Party platform with regard to our LGBT family and LGBT rights, said Aaron Jackson, president of the group.  The 2016 Republican platform includes a plank called Preserving and Protecting Traditional Marriage that calls for marriage to be defined as a union between one man and one woman.  About half a mile (one km) east of the convention site is a fake advertisement for a company called Dick to Dick LLC that ends with the line, Were not going to live forever. So why should the earth? The billboard sponsor's website (here) contains more satire including the bon mot, ""Need to buy a politician, the Media, or a law? Dick to Dick Executive Consulting is the website for you.

Trump calls Nice attack 'horror beyond belief',"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Saturday described as horror beyond belief the truck attack in Nice, France earlier this week that killed 84 people. At the beginning of an event to introduce his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Trump also expressed concern for the coup attempt in Turkey on Friday, saying he hoped it will all work out.

New urgency for Cleveland security after France truck attack,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Cleveland on Friday set up concrete traffic dividers and tall metal fences around next weeks Republican National Convention site, measures meant to thwart an attacker like one in France who drove a truck into a crowd, killing more than 80 people. Security experts said police, the U.S. Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies have viewed vehicles as a potential threat since early in their 18 months of planning for the convention where Donald Trump is due to be formally nominated for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.  The decision to erect the protective barriers was taken before Thursday nights attack in the French city of Nice. Ron Rowe, a high-ranking special agent with the Secret Service, told a news conference on Tuesday that some of the barriers would be going up that day.  Much of the focus has been on stopping a car or truck bomb like those that struck New Yorks World Trade Center in 1993 and an Oklahoma City federal office building in 1995. A vehicle-borne attack is always something youre concerned about, said Jason Porter, vice president for the central region of security provider Pinkerton, which is advising private sector clients on security around the convention.  Officials in Cleveland did not respond when asked whether the Nice attack had altered their security plans. The driver there, shot dead by police, was known to police for petty crimes but not for ties to Islamist militants. Thousands of people, including protesters against Trump, are expected to pack into Cleveland for the July 18-21 convention. Cleveland has banned drones, limited the size of bags people can carry and on Friday removed opaque rubbish bins near the Quicken Loans Arena convention site, replacing them with wire frames holding clear plastic waste bags that make it more difficult to hide objects. A memorial to slain police officers was cordoned off, an apparent reaction to protests against high-profile killings of black men and youth by police in U.S. cities including St. Paul, Minnesota, Baltimore, New York and Cleveland. After last weeks killing of five police officers in Dallas by an African American angry about police killings of black men, nearly half of Americas 30 biggest cities issued directives to pair up police officers on calls to boost safety, according to a Reuters survey of police departments.  T.J. Dow, a Cleveland city councilman for the neighborhood expected to see the bulk of protests, said the security plan was designed to be flexible. Dorothy Strauss, a 68-year-old retired customer service representative, acknowledged her fears in the face of the France attack while watching her granddaughters play in a sprinkler near the convention site. Were she a delegate, she would attend, Strauss said. On the flip side, I wouldnt come down here and hang out with my two granddaughters during the RNC. ",politicsNews,"July 15, 2016 ",1
White House candidate Trump announces Pence as his running mate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trumps choice of Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate on Friday helped bolster support among some conservatives skeptical about his policies, a crucial step as he prepares to accept the partys nomination next week. Some conservatives who had fought against Trumps ascendancy in the Republican nominating race welcomed his announcement that he had picked Pence, a well-known social and evangelical conservative. The Club for Growth, a conservative economic group, had sharply criticized Trumps support for protectionist trade policies. On Friday, the group noted that as a member of the House of Representatives, Pence had been a strong voice for free markets and economic liberty at a time when the Republican leadership had been weak on these issues. Todays news gives a similar hope that Mike Pence will be  effective in pulling the Republican ticket toward economic conservatism and limited government, the group said. Other conservatives were also heartened by Trumps VP pick, which the businessman announced in a tweet ahead of a joint appearance in his hometown of New York on Saturday. Pence is a principled conservative, man of faith, and talented messenger for Republican ideas, said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. His addition to the ticket will bring even more excitement to the voters who are eager to put a Republican in the White House and deny a third term for President Obamas liberal agenda. Trump, 70, chose Pence, 57, over two politicians he considers friends and close advisers, former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, 73, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, 53. Pence is viewed as a safe choice for Trump. The Indiana governors low-key demeanor is a contrast to that of the bombastic real estate developer. And he could take the fight to the Democrats in the months leading up to the Nov. 8 election without upstaging Trump. He and Trump will have to smooth over some policy differences. Pence has said he does not support trade protectionism or a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, two policies that are central to Trumps campaign message. In his first public remarks after Trump announced his running mate, Pence appeared to soften his opposition to a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country after he called it  offensive and unconstitutional in a tweet last December. I am very supportive of Donald Trumps call to temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represents a threat to the United States, Pence told conservative Fox News commentator Sean Hannity. We have no higher priority than the safety and security of the American people, Pence said, adding that he suspended a Syrian refugee program in Indiana after a shooting rampage last year in San Bernardino, California.  Pence also said he absolutely backed Trumps promise to build a wall between the United States and Mexico to stem illegal immigration and make Mexico pay for it. Trump said Pence had done a great job in Indiana and that of all the people he had interviewed for the job, theres nobody that agrees with me fully on everything. Pences selection was slammed by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintons campaign. By picking Mike Pence as his running mate, Donald Trump has doubled down on some of his most disturbing beliefs by choosing an incredibly divisive and unpopular running mate known for supporting discriminatory politics and failed economic policies that favor millionaires and corporations over working families, said Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta. Trump had faced a midday Friday deadline to announce Pence because the governor had to declare by then whether he would be on the ballot in his home state for re-election. Trump had postponed his announcement, which had been planned for Friday, out of respect for the victims in Nice, France. An attacker in a heavy truck drove into crowds celebrating Bastille Day, killing at least 84 people and injuring scores more in what President Francois Hollande called a terrorist act. Trump is set to be formally nominated as the partys candidate for the presidential election at the convention, which opens in Cleveland on Monday. Traditionally, the vice presidential choice is used to build enthusiasm among party loyalists. The Republican National Committee expects the convention to draw 50,000 people to the Ohio city, whose population is about 390,000. U.S. authorities were preparing for the possibility of violence, whether from demonstrators or planned attacks. The Cleveland conclave and the Democratic Party Convention the following week in Philadelphia have been given the status of special national security event by the federal government for the first time, and security will be heightened, said Republican Party spokesman Sean Spicer. The Department of Homeland Security will send more than 3,000 personnel to each convention, Secretary Jeh Johnson said on Thursday, speaking before the Nice attack. No specific or credible threat to either gathering has been reported, he said. ",politicsNews,"July 15, 2016 ",1
"Fund-raising stalled, Republican convention asks Adelson for donation","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - A handful of donors to the Republican National Convention have withdrawn pledges and fund-raising has stalled during Donald Trumps polarizing bid for the presidency, leading organizers to ask casino mogul Sheldon Adelson for an urgent donation. The Cleveland 2016 Host Committee said in a statement on Friday it had approached Adelson, a generous party benefactor, while also acknowledging its fund-raising has come to a virtual standstill, leaving a $6 million shortfall. Negative publicity around our potential nominee resulted in a considerable number of pledges backing out from their commitments, the Host Committee said in a letter it sent to Adelson, according to the political news website Politico, which said it had obtained the letter. The Host Committee on Friday confirmed such a letter was sent to Adelson and his wife, Miriam Adelson, but it downgraded the withdrawn pledges from considerable to a handful. It said the hastily sent original letter mischaracterized the status of some donations. Some companies identified in the letter as having backed out said on Friday they had never made such pledges. Unfortunately, this letter (to Adelson) was not reviewed nor authorized by the Host Committee chairpersons, and it mischaracterized certain donations from individuals and corporations, the statement said. Some of what were referred to as pledges were actually expectations based on pledges made to previous conventions, while a handful had been withdrawn from the Host Committee for 2016 Republican National Convention, it said. The committee said it had apologized to the Adelsons staff. Host Committee officials on Friday declined to comment beyond the official statement, leaving open the question of which donors reneged. Donations will be disclosed after the convention in U.S. Federal Election Commission filings. The statement, from Host Committee Chief Executive David Gilbert, also said the committee had raised $58.25 million to date, about $6 million short of its goal of $64 million to cover expenses for the four-day convention that starts Monday in Cleveland, where Trump is expected to receive the Republican presidential nomination. A month ago, a committee spokeswoman said $57.5 million had been raised. The Politico report, citing the letter, said David Koch, like Adelson a wealthy donor to conservative causes, and Coca-Cola (COKE.O) each withdrew a pledge of $1 million. Koch and Coke representatives told the Wall Street Journal they never made such pledges. Coke previously said it donated $75,000 last year. Visa, cited in the letter as having backed out of a $100,000 pledge, said in a statement it never made a pledge.     FedEx (FDX.N) and BP (BP.L) were named in the letter as withdrawing support but also told the Journal they had not made the stated commitments. Other marquee companies were also named but did not respond to Reuters queries after business hours on Friday. Representatives for the Adelsons could not immediately be reached for comment. Last month activists disturbed by Trumps campaign and led by the political arm of California-based advocacy group Color of Change launched an effort to try to shame companies into dropping sponsorships. It was unclear if that effort, which targeted more than 30 companies, had an impact. ",politicsNews,"July 16, 2016 ",1
Changes to North Carolina voting laws could put thousands of 2016 ballots at risk,"RALEIGH, North Carolina (Reuters) - On Election Day in 2014, Joetta Teal went to work at a polling station in Lumberton, North Carolina. Like all poll workers, she was required to stay until voting booths closed, so she decided to cast her own vote there. That was a mistake, she later discovered. What she didnt know was that under a 2013 state law she had to vote in the precinct where she lived. The polling station where she voted was not in her precinct, so her vote was not counted.  A Reuters review of Republican-backed changes to North Carolinas voting rules indicates as many as 29,000 votes might not be counted in this years Nov. 8 presidential election if a federal appeals court upholds the 2013 law. Besides banning voters from voting outside their assigned precinct on Election Day, the law also prevents them from registering the same day they vote during the early voting period.  The U.S. Justice Department says the law was designed to disproportionately affect minority groups, who are more likely to vote out of precinct and use same-day registration. Backers of the law deny this and say it will prevent voter fraud. The battleground state has a recent history of close races that have hinged on just a few thousand votes.Barack Obama, a Democrat, won North Carolina by just 14,177 votes in 2008. In 2012, Mitt Romney, a Republican, narrowly carried the state by a margin of just 2.04 percent.  Reuters reviewed state election board data showing the number of North Carolinians who made use of out-of-precinct voting and same-day registration in previous elections, including Marchs state nominating contest, or primary, when voters nominated their preferred presidential candidate.  The Reuters analysis includes some assumptions. For 29,000 votes to go uncounted on Nov. 8, North Carolinians would need to vote in the same numbers and in the same ways they have in previous elections, including the March primary.   In that primary, after a court temporarily ordered a stay on  the bans, 6,387 North Carolinians voted out of their assigned precinct and 22,501 registered the same day they voted.  The North Carolina Board of Elections did not respond to requests for comment on Reuters findings.  North Carolina Senator Bob Rucho, a Republican who backed the law, declined to comment specifically on the findings but disputed the notion that the law suppressed votes, saying the increased turnout between the 2010 and 2014 elections shows it has not had a disparate impact on minority voters. How can it show voter suppression when more black voters voted and more white voters voted, and there was more opportunity, and there are more black voters registered than there were before?  Turnout between those elections did rise by 1.8 percentage points for black voters and by 1.1 percentage points for white voters, according to data the state election board entered as evidence in court.  Advocacy group Democracy North Carolina, however, said their poll monitors saw many people attempting to vote out of precinct in 2014 who were told by officials their ballots would not count, and as a result cast no vote. And itsays 23,500 voters would have used same-day registration to vote in 2014 if it had not been banned, basing its findings on a review of election board data, hundreds of hotline calls, and the observations of more than 300 poll monitors.  North Carolina Board of Elections executive director Kim Strach said her office looked into claims of voters being turned away but generally did not find statewide evidence of it.  The Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is considering legal challenges to the law from the Justice Department and civil rights groups and citizens, is expected to issue a ruling in the next few weeks. North Carolinas Senate passed its new voting laws weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 in June 2013 to eliminate a requirement that nine states mostly in the South with a history of discrimination, including North Carolina, receive federal approval before changing election laws. Had that requirement been in place, it may have blocked the provisions now at issue, said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a non-profit legal defense fund. The Justice Department alleged a race-based purpose to the new law in a legal brief. Studies the department cited show that minority and low-income voters are more likely to use same-day registration and out-of-precinct voting because they are less likely to own a car or have flexible working hours. These voters are also more likely to vote for Democratic candidates.  If you pick out precisely the way minority voters are engaging with the process, thats intentionally treating minority voters differently, Justin Levitt, who oversees the Justice Departments voting unit, said in an interview.   North Carolina state officials say the changes cut fraud by making it harder for people to cast multiple ballots or impersonate other voters. The Justice Department said in court documents that voter fraud was virtually non-existent in the state. Rucho, the state senator, said while the law banned some voting methods and cut the early voting period from 17 to 10 days, it extended the hours during which voters could vote.  We opened up more locations for them to vote, more times to vote, more flexible times, said Rucho. FOUR-PERSON TEAM    Teal, who is African American, was one of 14 North Carolina voters Reuters contacted whose votes were invalid in 2014 because of the law.  Ten of them, including Teal, did not realize their votes were not counted until informed by Reuters. One was told his vote would not count by a voter advocacy group, and the other three were told by poll workers that their ballots likely would not count. In all, 1,390 ballots were rejected in the 2014 election because they were cast out of the voters assigned precinct  up from 49 rejected for the same reason in 2010, according tothe Reuters review of provisional ballots.  If they could have just sent people letters and told them exactly where to go, that would have been helpful, Teal said. The North Carolina Board of Elections website has a tool for residents to look up their assigned precincts, but Teal did not know about it. This year she plans to vote early. In other developed democracies, the government takes a greater responsibility for ensuring that voter registration lists are kept up to date and accurate, said Tova Wang, senior fellow at the policy research group Demos. The election board has been trying to educate North Carolinians about the ban on out-of-precinct voting through ads and a four-person voter outreach team that travels around the state to raise awareness about the changes, said Strach, the boards director.  Were telling people, go find out where you are, make sure youre showing up at the right precinct, Strach said.

Clinton leads Trump by 12 points ahead of Republican convention: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump trailed Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by 12 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday, making him the clear underdog ahead of next weeks Republican National Convention. Forty-five percent of likely voters supported former Secretary of State Clinton, 33 percent supported Trump, the wealthy businessman, and the remainder supported neither, according to the July 11-15 online poll. The survey showed little change from Tuesday, when Clinton had led Trump by 13 percentage points. Clinton has been ahead in the poll since early January. Trump only approached her level of support in May, after his last two remaining rivals quit the race and he became the presumptive Republican nominee. Trumps favorability has dropped since then, as his campaign began to focus on the Nov. 8 general election. Trump has faced criticism in recent weeks over his now-defunct Trump University venture, which is accused of making false promises, and over his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric. The poll results were mostly gathered before Thursday nights deadly truck attack in Nice, France, and before Trumps announcement on Friday that Indiana Governor Mike Pence would be his vice presidential running mate. The poll results suggest that Clintons use of personal email for government business while secretary of state and her handling of classified information have not damaged her support among likely voters.  But other polls show a closer race.  The CBS News/NY Times telephone poll has the candidates tied at 40 percent each, while a McClatchy/Marist telephone poll has Clinton leading by just 3 percentage points, 42 percent to Trumps 39 percent.  Trump may get a bump in the polls following next weeks convention in Cleveland, where the party is expected to rally behind him as the nominee. In 2012, support for Republican nominee Mitt Romney rose about 5 percentage points following the convention that year.  The Democratic convention is set for the following week, opening July 25 in Philadelphia. The Reuters/Ipsos poll surveyed 1,186 likely voters across the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"July 15, 2016 ",1
Pages of U.S. 9/11 report detailing possible Saudi ties made public,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress on Friday released a long-classified section of the official report on the Sept. 11 attacks describing an array of potential links between some of the hijackers and officials in Saudi Arabia. The 28 pages of the report on the 2002 investigation focus on potential Saudi government ties to the 2001 aircraft attacks on the United States, in which nearly 3,000 people died. The report said the alleged links had not been independently verified. The pages were released by the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee after years of wrangling in Washington between Congress and different administrations, Republicans and Democrats, and urging by families of those killed. The matter is now finished, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told a news conference in Washington. Asked whether the report exonerated the kingdom, he replied: Absolutely. The release of the previously classified pages is unlikely to end the controversy over the role of Saudi Arabia, an important U.S. partner in the Middle East. Many U.S. officials who opposed their release had worried they would damage diplomatic relations. Fifteen of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudi citizens. According to various FBI documents and CIA memorandum, some of the September 11 hijackers, while in the United States, apparently had contacts with individuals who may be connected to the Saudi Government, the report said, giving a catalog of alleged links. They included reported contacts between Saudis in California, money possibly sent from the Saudi royal family to the hijackers and even a statement that a reported Saudi Interior Ministry official stayed at the same Virginia hotel as one hijacker in September 2001. One section said Omar al-Bayoumi, said to be a Saudi intelligence officer, met with two hijackers at a public place after they arrived in San Diego. Citing Federal Bureau of Investigation files, it said his salary rose to $3,700 a month from $465 two months after two of the hijackers arrived in California. Another described how two of the hijackers asked flight attendants technical questions during a trip in 1999 from Phoenix to Washington to attend a party at the Saudi embassy. One tried twice to enter the cockpit. The plane made an emergency landing and the FBI investigated, but did not prosecute. The newly declassified pages also say a telephone number found in a telephone book of Abu Zubaydah, a Saudi-born al Qaeda operative captured in Pakistan, was for a Colorado corporation that managed the affairs of the residence of Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the former Saudi ambassador to Washington.  The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said its agreement to the release is not an indication that the intelligence community agrees with the pages accuracy or concurs with the information it contains. The office also on Friday released a declassified summary of an assessment of whether Riyadh may have supported al Qaeda before and after the attacks, saying the Saudi government and many of its agencies had been infiltrated and exploited by individuals associated with or sympathetic to Osama bin Ladens militant network. Several members of Congress said they were pleased the pages had finally been released. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the intelligence panel, said he hoped the release would quiet rumors. The Intelligence Community and the 9/11 Commission, which followed the Joint Inquiry that produced these so-called 28 pages, investigated the questions they raised and was never able to find sufficient evidence to support them, he said. Legislation that would allow families of Sept. 11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia, was passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate and is making its way through the House, despite President Barack Obamas veto threat. While the pages do not reach a conclusion regarding Saudi involvement in the 9/11 attacks, they provide more than enough evidence to raise serious concerns, said Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. His state was home to many people killed when planes hit the World Trade Center in neighboring New York. Sept. 11 families made clear the pages release would not stop their push for the legislation. Congress has to stand up for the interests of the thousands of innocent Americans who lost loved ones on 9/11, one group said in a statement. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters before the pages were released that they would show no evidence of Saudi complicity. The Obama administration sent a declassified version of the 28 pages, with many lines and sentences blacked out to protect intelligence sources and methods, to Congress on Friday morning. The House intelligence panel released it a few hours later. ",politicsNews,"July 15, 2016 ",1
Saudi says hopes release of '28 pages' clears up 9/11 suspicions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia welcomed on Friday the release of classified pages of the official report on the Sept. 11 attacks, and hoped their release would clear up suspicions about Riyadhs actions, intentions or long-term friendship with the United States. Since 2002, the 9/11 Commission and several government agencies, including the CIA and the FBI, have investigated the contents of the 28 Pages and have confirmed that neither the Saudi government, nor senior Saudi officials, nor any person acting on behalf of the Saudi government provided any support or encouragement for these attacks, Saudi Arabias ambassador to the United States, Abdullah al-Saud, said in a statement. We hope the release of these pages will clear up, once and for all, any lingering questions or suspicions about Saudi Arabias actions, intentions, or long-term friendship with the United States.

Trump's VP pick rankles Republican gay rights activists,"CLEVELAND/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps choice of Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate has irked some Republican activists who see the Indiana governors years of opposition to gay rights initiatives as a setback to efforts to broaden the partys appeal. The pick could bolster Trumps support among religious conservatives, but it also opens up a new line of attack for Democrats and liberals seeking to paint the New York businessman as a divisive candidate, putting at risk his efforts to woo moderate voters ahead of the Nov. 8 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton.[nL1N1A10HR] Rachel Hoff, the first openly gay member of the Republican Partys platform committee, has spent time in Cleveland ahead of next weeks party convention trying repeatedly to get the party to change its official position on gay marriage and adoption by gay couples. She was dismayed by the choice of Pence. After the Pence announcement, I think the question is - is Trump really moderate on gay rights issues? It seems more likely his rhetoric has been a smoke screen, Hoff said. Theres no substance behind it. By picking Pence, Trump is signaling his administration may not be any friendlier to the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community. Megan Robertson, a Republican strategist in Indiana who has pushed for the party to be more open to gay members, was similarly disappointed. Picking Pence shows that he maybe doesnt care about that community as much as he tried to profess that he did, she said of Trump. Clintons campaign seized on the announcement to attack Pences record on gay rights issues, saying it embarrassed the people of Indiana. Clinton has previously called Trump the most divisive candidate in our lifetimes, referring to his calls to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country and to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. In 2015, Pence found himself at the center of a national uproar when he signed a bill that he said was meant to protect religious liberty, but which critics countered would allow business owners to deny services to gay people.  After intense pressure from liberal groups and large corporations, he asked lawmakers to clarify that businesses could not deny services on the basis of sexual orientation, calling it a subject of great misunderstanding. He has also fought against same-sex marriage and allowing gay people to serve openly in the military. A U.S. Supreme Court ruing last year legalized gay marriage nationwide and the Pentagon in 2011 ended the ban on openly gay and lesbian people serving in the military. In 2009, while a member of the U.S. Congress, Pence argued against expanding the definition of a hate crime to include sexual orientation, calling it an attempt to advance a radical social agenda. The federal hate crimes law was expanded to make this inclusion. Gay supporters of Trump are hopeful Pence will have little influence on a potential Trump administration.  Trump has declared himself the most gay-friendly candidate in the election. He expressed support for the gay community after a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando in June that killed 49 people, and broke from his party during an argument  about transgender bathroom usage, saying people could use the bathroom of their choosing at his office building Trump Tower in New York. That has cheered moderate Republicans who have been seeking to appeal to younger, more liberal voters. Donald Trump is the nominee of the party and Donald Trump is going to set policy, said Chris Barron, who has launched LGBTrump, a group seeking to encourage gays to vote for Trump. Pence, 57, comes from a different wing of the divided Republican Party than Trump, one that is dominated by evangelicals in southern and midwestern states. Conservatives were elated with his selection. Its the best conservatives could possibly want, said Brent Bozell, a conservative leader.  The pro-gay rights group Log Cabin Republicans said it would seek to pressure the Republican Party at the Cleveland national convention to adopt a more gay-friendly policy platform, including by running a full-page ad in a local paper. The partys platform committee met early in the week to draft official policy positions on myriad issues. The document, which carries little significance beyond the symbolic, calls for a constitutional amendment to reverse the Supreme Courts decision legalizing gay marriage and included a veiled acceptance of gay conversion therapy, a practice that has widely been criticized as harmful to children. Despite the disappointment that gay rights activists are feeling, Log Cabin Republican president Gregory Angelo said he thinks voters are going to look at Trumps past statement on gay rights and not where Pence stands. Trump has spent little time talking about social issues and has instead focused on immigration and economic issues.  Donald Trump rose to stardom as our presumptive nominee because he showcased an opposition to illegal immigration and unfair trade deals. Thats whats resonating with the Republican electorate this year, he said. ",politicsNews,"July 15, 2016 ",1
Saudi foreign minister welcomes release of pages from 9-11 report,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabias foreign minister said on Friday he welcomed the release of a long-classified section of the official report on the Sept. 11 attacks that discussed potential links between some of the hijackers and Saudi Arabia. The matter is now finished, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told a news conference in Washington. Asked whether the report exonerated the kingdom, he said: Absolutely. The 28 pages of the report on the 2002 investigation focus on potential Saudi links to the 2001 aircraft attacks on the United States, in which nearly 3,000 people died. They were issued by the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee on Friday after years of wrangling in Washington between Congress and different administrations, Republicans and Democrats, and urging by families of those killed.

"EU and U.S. seek trade deal this year, knowing large hurdles remain","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU and U.S. negotiators said on Friday that they still needed to overcome large differences for a transatlantic free trade deal to be sealed this year, and factor in the impending exit from the European Union of Britain, one of the United States biggest export markets. The two sides are trying to agree on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which supporters say could boost each economy by some $100 billion at a time when growth in China and emerging markets is slowing. Chief EU negotiator Ignacio Garcia Bercero and U.S. counterpart Dan Mullaney told a news conference after a 14th round of talks that both sides were committed to sealing a deal before U.S. President Barack Obama leaves office at the turn of the year. The partners have made progress on tariff elimination and on regulatory cooperation. However, they are stuck over EU demands including greater access to public sector tenders; Garcia Bercero described the U.S. offer as a serious cause of concern. Likewise, Washington is unhappy with the EU offer on services.  Given the importance of this sector to both of our economies ... progress here has been noticeably and painfully slow, said Mullaney. He also said that, while the economic rationale for TTIP remained strong, Britains exit from the European Union would force a rethink as it was the largest market anywhere for U.S. services, and took 25 percent of U.S. exports to the EU. Imagine if the United States said, for instance, Well, maybe TTIP will not apply to California. There is a certain reflection that the parties need to have on those kind of developments. The two sides had previously planned to produce a single consolidated TTIP text by the end of July. Garcia Bercero said that was now more likely to come by the end of September after further meetings between U.S. trade chief Michael Froman and EU commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom. Garcia Bercero acknowledged that the political environment was becoming more challenging. The environmental group Greenpeace echoed the view of many anti-TTIP campaigners on Friday by saying that it was time to hit the Stop button. But the EU negotiator said TTIP was instead a positive response to concerns about globalization. If we want to have a shot at shaping globalization, we need a like-minded partner that shares largely our views, he said. Mullaney talked of a unique window of opportunity to complete TTIP this year that should not be allowed to slip away. After this year, with one political transition after another over the next few years, it could be quite a while before we pick up negotiations again. ",politicsNews,"July 15, 2016 ",1
White House hopeful Trump nears end of vice presidential search,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump neared the end of his vice presidential search on Thursday and appeared to be leaning toward Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a conservative with the potential to unify divided Republicans. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee tweeted on Wednesday night that he would announce his choice on Friday at 11 a.m. (1500 GMT) in Manhattan. The New York businessman is to be formally nominated as the partys candidate for the Nov. 8 election at the Republican National Convention next week in Cleveland. Traditionally, the vice presidential choice is used to build enthusiasm among party loyalists. Trumps choice of running mate is seen as critical because his defeat of 16 rivals in the Republican primary race left the party divided and some party leaders are still uneasy about some of his campaign positions, and his style. Sources familiar with campaign operations cautioned that while Pence and former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich were finalists, Trump could always have a last-minute change of heart and choose someone else from his short list. A source close to the campaign said Trump appeared to be  leaning toward Pence but could easily change his mind. Gingrich told an ABC News correspondent he expected to hear Trumps decision after 1 p.m. EDT and would not be surprised if Trump chooses Pence.  New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, 53, a former rival to Trump in the presidential race, is also high on the list of potential running mates and provides the kind of counterpunch to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton that Republicans like. Pence, 57, a former congressman, is seen as a safe choice, not too flashy but popular among conservatives, with Midwestern appeal and the ability to rally more party faithful behind Trump. Gingrich, 73, is a close adviser to Trump with a wealth of ideas and deep experience in the legislative process from his time as speaker of the House of Representatives in the 1990s. In what has been an unusually public process, Trump, 70, sat down with both Pence and Gingrich separately in Indianapolis on Wednesday. He also met with a fourth potential No. 2, U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions, 69, of Alabama, who has been one of Trumps closest advisers. The New York businessman had dinner with Pence on Tuesday night after they appeared together at a rally. Trump, joined by daughter Ivanka and sons Donald Jr. and Eric Trump, had breakfast with Pence and his wife, Karen, on Wednesday at the governors residence in Indianapolis. Trump adviser Ed Brookover told CNN that Trump first and foremost wants a running mate who he has good chemistry with and someone who can help him govern best. ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 ",1
"Republicans, Democrats sharply divided over Muslims in America: Reuters/Ipsos poll","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Many Americans view Islam unfavorably, and supporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump are more than twice as likely to view the religion negatively as those backing Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, according to a Reuters/Ipsos online poll of more than 7,000 Americans. It shows that 37 percent of American adults have a somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable view of Islam. This includes 58 percent of Trump supporters and 24 percent of Clinton supporters, a contrast largely mirrored by the breakdown between Republicans and Democrats. By comparison, respondents overall had an equally unfavorable view of atheism at 38 percent, compared with 21 percent for Hinduism, 16 percent for Judaism and 8percent for Christianity.  Spokespeople for Trump and Clinton declined to comment. The poll took place before an attacker on Thursday drove his truck into a holiday crowd in Nice, France, killing more than 80 people in what President Francois Hollande called a terrorist act. Police sources said the driver, while linked to common crimes, was not on a watch list of intelligence services and no Islamist militant group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. The race for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election has put a spotlight on Americans views of Muslims with Trump proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. He repeated the proposal after Omar Mateen, a New York-born Muslim armed with an assault rifle, killed 49 people in an attack on a Florida gay nightclub last month.  The ideological divide between Trump and Clinton supporters is set against a backdrop of increasing violence and discrimination against Muslims in the United States. The poll shows 78percent of Trump supporters and 36 percent of Clinton supporters said that when compared to other religions, Islam was more likely to encourage acts of terrorism. Trump supporters were also about twice as likely as Clinton supporters to say that Islam was more encouraging ofviolence toward Americans, women and gay people. Polling on none of the other belief systems and their perceived connection to terrorism or violence came close to matching those numbers. Clinton has called for a more inclusive environment within American society and for a joint effort between the U.S. government and Muslim countries to battle the spread of Islamist militancy.  She has criticized Trumps harsh statements about Muslims and Mexicans while Trump has bemoaned what he calls American societys devotion to political correctness. Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/29IPJ6l Party affiliation accounted for the deepest division among Americans where their views on Muslims were concerned. Respondents status as rich or poor, young or old, or male or female did not offer as pronounced an overall view as did their identification as Democrats or Republicans.  If it was true that Trump did not represent Republicans broadly defined, you would think Republicans would look different; they dont, said Douglas McAdam, a sociology professor at Stanford University who studies American politics. It goes against the claims of the (former presidential candidate) Mitt Romneys of the world, that Trump is not really a Republican, that he doesnt represent the Republican party. He seems to be resonating with Republicans generally. According to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights group, attacks on American Muslims and on mosques in the United States rose in 2015 to their highest level ever recorded.  The group said 31 incidents of damage or destruction of mosques were reported; there were 11 incidents in which a Muslim person was the target of a slur or another kind of harassment.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll ran in all 50 states from June 14 to July 6. It included 7,473 American adults and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 1 percentage point.

We need someone who is steady and secure in his principles, someone who can cut through the noise and make a compelling case for conservatism. Mike Pence is that man, Ryan said in a statement.

Trump's expected VP pick: coal advocate who defied Obama's climate agenda,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trumps selection of Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate cheered the U.S. energy industry and dismayed green advocates, with both sides citing Pences support for coal mining and defiance of President Barack Obamas climate-change agenda. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has called climate change a hoax and promised to gut U.S. environmental regulations in order to help the ailing oil and coal sectors. A Trump-Pence ticket will quash any expectation that the New York businessman might soften that stance heading into the Nov. 8 election. Governor Pence has been a vocal opponent of the administrations Clean Power Plan, said Laura Sheehan, spokeswoman for the Washington-based lobby group American Council on Clean Coal Electricity.   We would hope to see a continuation, she said. Trump announced Pence as his running mate in a Twitter post on Friday morning, ending days of speculation over the choice ahead of the partys national convention in Cleveland next week. [nL1N1A10HR] Pence, 57, is listed on Obamas call out the climate change deniers website for arguing that the science behind climate change has not yet been resolved. In June 2015, Pence wrote to Obama saying that Indiana, Americas eighth largest coal-producing state, would not comply with the Clean Power Plan regulating power plant emissions, calling it ill-advised. Indiana is one of more than 25 states that have challenged the centerpiece of the Democratic presidents environmental agenda. In 2014, Pence alarmed local environmental groups by overturning an energy efficiency program enacted by his Republican predecessor, Mitch Daniels, saying it was too expensive for the states manufacturers. The Indiana Public Utility Commission had estimated the program would create more than 18,600 jobs. The choice of Pence shows Trump has little interest in appealing to anyone outside of his extremist base and Big Polluters, said Clay Schroers, a director at the League of Conservation Voters environmental group.     Trump has long signaled his support of traditional energy production - part of his broader appeal to blue-collar American voters.  He outlined plans in May to sweep away environmental regulations ushered in by Obama, scrap the Paris Climate Accord, and revive the Keystone XL pipeline proposal  moves that would reverse years of gains by the green movement. Trumps Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in contrast, has promised more stringent regulation of the energy sector, efforts to boost renewable fuels use, and a commitment to join other nations to combat global climate change. Pence ran for governor in 2012 after serving in the U.S. Congress. His campaign for governor received more than $850,000 from the energy sector, about 3 percent of the total, according to campaign finance disclosures. More than $300,000 of that came from the billionaire Koch brothers, strong advocates of small government and fiscal conservatism who took a liking to Pence. Both David and Charles Koch have said they will not support the Trump ticket. Trump has alarmed many Republican establishment figures with his fiery rhetoric on immigration and trade.  But a former high-ranking operative in the Koch political organization who is close to both brothers said Pence could help make the donor network more receptive to Trumps campaign.

Trump backers sue San Jose for allowing 'mob' assault,"(Reuters) - Police in the California city of San Jose, motivated by the political leanings of city officials, allowed an angry mob to assault Donald Trump supporters as they left a rally for the presumptive Republican presidential candidate last month, a lawsuit filed on Thursday alleges. The civil lawsuit, filed by 14 Trump supporters against the city of San Jose, its mayor, police chief and a number of other individuals, says police funneled Trump supporters outside the citys convention center directly into a crowd of hundreds of physically violent and aggressive protesters. The plaintiffs add that city officials directed roughly 250 San Jose police officers not to intervene amid a melee of violent criminal acts perpetrated by dozens of anti-Trump protesters. The San Jose City Attorney, Richard Doyle, said he had not yet read the complaint, but that police made many arrests and the city is committed to first amendment rights and protecting people. A police department spokesman referred inquiries to Doyles office. Mayor Sam Liccardo, a Democrat, said in statement that the city will do everything necessary to prosecute those who acted illegally. The ludicrous accusation that I somehow directed the police department to stand down at the rally is utterly false, Liccardo said. Tense and sometimes violent demonstrations have peppered Trumps political rallies in New Mexico and California in recent months. Protesters are also expected to converge on the Republican National Convention next week in Cleveland. Hundreds of people in San Jose, many angry over Trumps statements about immigration, gathered outside his event last month. Members of the crowd waved Mexican flags, chanted anti-Trump slogans, and burned Trump hats along with at least one U.S. flag. The lawsuit alleges Liccardo, police chief Edgardo Garcia, and some 40 other people stripped Trump backers of their rights to free speech and assembly. According to the lawsuit, which seeks unspecified compensation, one Trump backer was pelted with eggs and spat on, while another, a 71-year-old woman, had her hair pulled and her glasses broken. At one point, the lawsuit says, a 14-year-old boy was struck in the back of his head as members of the crowd shouted, Kill him!  Speaking at a campaign event the day after the events in San Jose, Trump described the rally as a love fest inside. No problems whatsoever. But then his supporters walked out and they got accosted by a bunch of thugs, he said. ",politicsNews,"July 15, 2016 ",1
"U.S. House passes Iran sanctions, financial services measures","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed two pieces of legislation linked to the international nuclear agreement with Iran on Thursday, one year after the landmark pact was announced, defying President Barack Obamas veto threat. Voting largely along party lines, the Republican-controlled House voted 246 to 179 to pass a new set of sanctions on Iran, and 246 to 181 for a measure to block Irans access to the U.S. financial system, including use of the dollar. The House on Wednesday passed a bill to bar the U.S. purchase of heavy water, also with little backing from Democrats. Heavy water is a non-radioactive byproduct from making nuclear weapons and nuclear energy. The Obama administration said in April the United States would buy $8.6 million worth of heavy water from Iran, angering Republicans who called it a subsidy of the countrys nuclear program. The measures were among the last the House passed before Congress left Washington for a seven-week summer recess. There was no word on when, or whether, the measures would be taken up in the Senate. Every congressional Republican, and several of Obamas fellow Democrats, opposed the nuclear deal between Iran, the United States and other world powers announced in July 2015 in which Tehran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for relief from crippling international sanctions. Since then, Republicans have repeatedly offered sanctions bills and other Iran-related legislation that Democrats dismiss as bids to score political points by undermining a deal seen as a potential foreign policy legacy for Obama. Republicans say they want to punish Iran for actions including its ballistic missile tests and send a strong message that Tehran should abide by its international commitments.

"In Virginia, Clinton tests Senator Tim Kaine as a 'safe' VP pick","WASHINGTON/ANNANDALE, Virginia (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton campaigned with potential vice presidential running-mate U.S. Senator Tim Kaine in his home state of Virginia on Thursday, testing whether the person widely seen as the safe choice can propel her to the White House in November.  Kaines 16-minute introduction of the presumptive Democratic nominee in a community college gymnasium in the Washington suburb of Annandale reflected Clintons need to reach out to Hispanic voters with her vice presidential pick. Kaine, a former missionary in Honduras who speaks Spanish, peppered his introduction with Spanish phrases and criticism of Republican Donald Trumps statements regarding Latinos. He trash talks Latinos - to him it doesnt matter if you are a new immigrant or youre a worker who has been here for a long time or a DREAMer or if youre a Latina governor of New Mexico or a federal judge, Kaine said to applause. Kaine was referring to statements Trump has made about young immigrants brought to the United States by their parents, New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez and the judge overseeing a civil fraud lawsuit against Trump University. Kaine could help Clinton check a lot of boxes in the list of requirements for a running mate.  The former civil rights lawyer is a Virginian, which could help Clinton win a battleground state in the Nov. 8 race against Trump. Such states are hotly contested because their populations can swing either to Republicans or Democrats and play a decisive role in presidential elections. Kaine is also affable, savvy about foreign policy and has executive experience as a former governor of Virginia and a former mayor of Richmond, the states capital. Though the Clinton campaign is keeping the vice presidential selection process tightly under wraps, many Democrats in Washington see Kaine as the front-runner. Some Democrats in Congress and in outside groups want to see Clinton make a more unconventional pick for her already historic run as the first female presidential nominee of a major party. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a fierce critic of Wall Street, and Julian Castro, a Latino who is the U.S. secretary of housing and urban development, are two possibilities mentioned by Democrats who want to see Clinton go with a bold choice before the Democratic convention in Philadelphia July 25-28. Labor Secretary Tom Perez, Representative Xavier Becerra of California, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and, more recently, retired Navy Admiral James Stavridis have also been mentioned as possibilities. Asked about Kaine, Artie Blanco, a superdelegate from Nevada, said he would not be her top pick. Excited, no. OK with, you know, sure, she said. Blanco said she likes Becerra and Perez as potential picks. She said Warren would be fantastic and she likes Browns stance on worker issues. Thursdays event with Kaine gave Clinton an opportunity to gauge whether the 58-year-old, Harvard-educated senator would help her fire up a crowd and make for a comfortable fit on the campaign trail.  Cynthia Smith, a registered nurse from Cleveland, was at the event because her nephew is a volunteer with the campaign. She said she was not familiar with Kaine and would like to hear more from him, but at this point preferred Warren. Id like to see two women, Smith said. Clinton had lunch with Democratic senators on Capitol Hill on Thursday. After the session, the lawmakers were mostly mum. When Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the top Democrat, was asked by a reporter what the takeaway from the lunch was, he responded: Shes going to be president. Clinton spoke to the senators about returning the Senate to Democratic control and about how to create jobs in all 50 U.S. states. Some Democratic senators have been rallying around colleague Kaine, while others are holding out for a bolder pick. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, who has served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with Kaine, said in a brief interview: If you look at the totality of Tims life and his work, I think there are elements that would bridge that divide between progressive Democrats and more establishment Democrats who have fostered Clintons drive for the White House.

Kerry's Syria plan greeted with concern over Russian intentions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Thursday to propose close military coordination in Syria, the White House and Pentagon offered lukewarm support for the plan and demanded that Moscow show it was serious about fighting Islamic State, not just propping up President Bashar al-Assad.Kerry himself took a tough line after his meeting on Thursday with Putin, State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters in Moscow.  Secretary Kerry emphasized that absent concrete, near-term steps, diplomatic efforts could not continue indefinitely, Kirby said. Kerrys proposal would create a new center where U.S. and Russian militaries would share intelligence and coordinate air strikes against Islamic State and the Nusra Front, an al Qaeda affiliate. The move has angered U.S. military and intelligence officers and diplomats who argue that Russia has proved repeatedly that it cannot be trusted. Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said Defense Secretary Ash Carter supported Kerrys efforts to encourage Moscow to do the right thing in Syria. But he added that Carter has experience dealing with Moscow and maintains a healthy dose of skepticism about Russias aims in the conflict.  The secretary supports Secretary Kerrys effort ... but he has also said that hes had questions about the Russian activities up to this point, Cook told reporters.  If the Russians are prepared to do the right thing in Syria, then the secretary of defense would be open to that conversation, he said. But were waiting to see whats going on. ... Its not clear that well ever reach an agreement. WHITE HOUSE SAYS ITS UP TO RUSSIA At the White House, spokesman Josh Earnests response was similarly cautious. Its time for Russia to make serious decisions about how they want to use their influence inside of Syria both when it comes to their diplomatic influence, but also when it comes to their military capabilities, Earnest told a daily briefing on Thursday at the White House,  They have to decide if theyre going to use the military to prop up the Assad regime or if theyre going to use their military to go after extremists, Earnest said, Our case is you cant do both. Kerry has expressed growing frustration with the lack of progress in ending Syrias five-year civil war despite agreements with Russia to secure a lasting nationwide cessation of hostilities and ensure that humanitarian aid reaches besieged communities. U.N.-led efforts to bring the warring sides together to negotiate a political transition also have failed. State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau acknowledged  a very robust and very vigorous conversation among government agencies over Kerrys plan. Asked whether Kerrys visit had the full backing of the White House, she added: Im not going to characterize that for the White House, but I would say that the secretary is going to ... have discussions in Moscow that present the administrations views. Anger Within the Administration But U.S. military and intelligence officers and diplomats involved in Syria policy expressed anger about Kerrys proposal, which several called naive. The Russians, said one official, had known for weeks about Kerrys upcoming visit to Moscow, yet two days before he was due to arrive they bombed a remote camp near Syrias border with Jordan used by U.S.-backed rebels. That is consistent with what the Russians have been doing all along, said a U.S. military official, who like others spoke anonymously to criticize administration policy. More of it has been to us, not with us, and the message has been clear all along: When our interests differ from yours, ours win. Theyve violated every cessation of hostilities agreement theyve ever agreed to, sometimes within hours, the official said.  Another American official, who has helped train members of the Free Syrian Army rebel alliance, said the U.S.-backed opposition forces have been asking why the administration keeps seeking Russian help and are growing increasingly bitter, their anger compounded by what they complain is a lack of American military support. Former U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford expressed deep skepticism with Kerrys plan, saying Russian air strikes have primarily targeted U.S-supported moderate opposition groups. How serious are they (Russia) about defeating terrorism, as opposed to bolstering Assads position at the center? How are we to assume that they are going to do better if they work with the Americans? Ford told Reuters. Ford said that Russia has been unable to get its obstreperous client Assad to make any political concessions, allow significant humanitarian assistance into numerous rebel-held enclaves or abide by a cessation of hostilities agreement. I dont think the Russians can deliver, he said. I dont see how this American-Russian condominium on the Islamic State can help bring about a negotiated solution to the broader Syrian conflict. It will make it less likely that Assad will make concessions that will bring the broader civil war to an end. ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 ",1
"Senators urge U.S. to close lead testing gaps, citing Reuters investigation","(Reuters) - Some influential U.S. senators are urging a federal agency to take action to ensure more children are tested for lead poisoning, citing a Reuters investigation that found millions are missing required lead tests, leaving some vulnerable to lifelong health effects. In a three-page letter to be sent on Friday, U.S. senators including Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Deborah Stabenow of Michigan, all Democrats, called on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), to re-evaluate its lead screening policy for millions of Medicaid-eligible children. The senators want CMS to improve U.S. blood lead testing rates they called dismal, and to ensure all state Medicaid programs comply with testing rules and provide treatment for children with elevated blood lead levels. Medicaid is a U.S. government program that provides health care for low-income and disabled people.  The letter, provided to Reuters by Browns office, cites a JuneReuters investigation (reut.rs/1YgbjCX) detailing how millions of U.S. children are falling through the cracks of early childhood lead testing requirements. Though Medicaid has long required children in the program to receive blood lead tests at ages one and two, Reuters obtained data from nearly a dozen states showing that only 41 percent of Medicaid-eligible children were tested as required in 2014.    Those shortfalls left some children vulnerable to prolonged and preventable lead exposure, which can stunt their cognitive development and cause permanent mental and physical ailments.    Concerns about childhood lead exposure have grown sharply after children in Flint, Michigan were poisoned by lead-tainted drinking water starting in 2014. Across the country, more than 500,000 U.S. children have elevated lead levels, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Another exposure risk is old lead paint in millions of homes built before 1978. In Cleveland, Ohio, for instance, 13.7 percent of children tested had elevated levels of lead in their blood, Reuters found. Children in Ohio are being poisoned by their own homes, Senator Brown said on Thursday. To protect our children, we need better coordination between federal and state health agencies and Medicaid physicians. Experts cited several factors for the gaps: some doctors do not order the tests or are unaware of Medicaid and state rules; children miss appointments or parents do not follow up on test referrals; and Medicaid and health departments do little to enforce testing. The testing guidelines are often confusing, and federal and state data on lead testing contain gaps. In the letter, the lawmakers urge CMS to take steps to get more children tested and to review and update its lead screening protocols, and help guide state Medicaid administrators to make sure all at-risk children get screened.

Protesters keeping kids away from Cleveland Republican convention,"(Reuters) - A Milwaukee-based immigrants rights group canceled plans to take children to demonstrations outside the Republican National Convention, which starts on Monday, citing fears of violence after last weeks shootings in Dallas. Voces de la Frontera (Voices from the Border) typically includes children in its marches, seeking to humanize the debate over immigration policy, but opted against that in Cleveland because things can escalate, group member Daniel Gutierrez said. Donald Trump is expected to officially become the Republican candidate for president at the convention, which runs from Monday to Thursday, when myriad protest groups from around the country are expected to converge on Cleveland. Protests at Trump campaign events have turned volatile, and tensions could be heightened by the presence of citizens carrying firearms. Ohio gun laws will allow people to openly carry firearms at the protests, while more innocuous items such as tennis balls, umbrellas with steel points and water guns will be prohibited. Police said the presence of openly carried weapons complicated their job at the Dallas protest shootings, when a former U.S. Army reservist shot dead five police officers, seeking revenge for police killings of black men. About 45 members of Voces de la Frontera plan to participate in a Coalition to Stop Trump rally on Monday, said Gutierrez, adding that he was unafraid that others may bring guns.  If anything comes up that puts our lives at risk, we definitely are not going to stand there. If anything breaks out, just remove ourselves from there. Go to a safe location, Gutierrez said. Brad Sigal, a spokesman for the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, said his organization was training marshals to keep the group safe, primarily by steering members clear of  potential confrontations. About 50 of its members would travel to Cleveland, he said.  There will be a lot of police there, there may be counterprotests, but were there to get our message out and thats what were going to do, Sigal said. Were aware of the situation and preparing for it. Rustbelt Medics, a group of street medics that volunteers first aid at political events, has been conducting medical training in preparation for the convention. Gloria Tavera, a medical student and street medic with the group, says Rustbelt Medics will have trained about 50 people prior to the convention. Part of the training definitely involves what happens when people get hit by rubber bullets, Tavera said. ",politicsNews,"July 14, 2016 ",1
U.S. lawmakers introduce bill to criminalize ‘revenge porn’,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced long-stalled legislation on Thursday that would make it a federal crime to share sexually explicit material of a person online without the subjects consent. The Intimate Privacy Protection Act is an effort several years in the making to combat the rise in recent years of revenge porn, images that are shared on the internet in order to extort or humiliate someone. The practice disproportionately affects women. These acts of bullying have ruined careers, families, and even led to suicide, Representative Jackie Speier, a California Democrat and lead author of the bill, said in a statement.  The legislation would allow fines and up to five years in prison for posting online or distributing sexually explicit photos or videos with reckless disregard for the consent of the subject. More than 30 states have enacted similar laws in recent years.  Exceptions listed in the bill would allow for posting material that is in the public interest or that features a person voluntarily posing nude in a public or commercial setting. The bill stalled for years amid concerns raised by technology companies and internet freedom advocates worried that service providers such as Alphabet Incs YouTube could be exposed to liability for acting as third-party hosts of revenge porn content shared by users.  Speiers bill, which was introduced with support from Facebook and Twitter, exempts such companies as long as they do not promote or solicit revenge porn content. Many tech companies have tightened their terms of service in recent years to prohibit revenge porn. Those companies typically rely on users to report objectionable content to teams of human reviewers who delete content found to violate terms of service. Democratic Representatives Katherine Clark and Gregory Meeks and Republican Representatives Ryan Costello and Tom Rooney joined the bill as original co-sponsors. ",politicsNews,"July 14, 2016 ",1
"FBI, Homeland Security chiefs preparing for violence at political conventions","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers on Thursday that they were preparing their agencies for the possibility of violence, both from unruly demonstrators and terrorists, at the upcoming Republican and Democratic nominating conventions.  Speaking before the House Homeland Security Committee, Johnson said he was concerned that demonstrations at the events could get out of hand. In an interview with Reuters following his testimony, Johnson said he knew of no specific or credible threat to either convention but that it was important to be prepared.   Johnson said the Department of Homeland Security would be sending more than 3,000 personnel to each convention.  Recent clashes between attendees and protesters at rallies for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump have led to physical assaults and arrests. The Republican National Convention being held July 18-21 in Cleveland and the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia from July 25-28 follow a string of high-profile shootings. In June, an Islamic State sympathizer committed the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, killing 49 people in a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Last week, five police officers in Dallas were killed by a black man angry about police shootings of unarmed black men. Comey told the committee that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was monitoring the threat of violence at the conventions very, very carefully.     Anytime there is a national spotlight on a political event in the United States, there is a risk that groups that aspire to do just that, engage in acts of domestic terrorism, will be attracted, Comey said.

Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg 'regrets' Trump criticisms,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Thursday said she regrets making critical comments about Republican presidential contender Donald Trump. On reflection, my recent remarks in response to press inquiries were ill-advised and I regret making them, she said in a statement issued by the court. Ginsburg, the 83-year-old senior liberal member of the high court, inserted herself into the U.S. presidential election in recent days by making negative remarks about Trump in a series of media interviews.  Her earlier remarks prompted criticism from Trump, who said she should resign. In one of a series of Twitter posts, he also said Ginsburgs mind is shot. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Ginsburgs statement. Legal ethics scholars also questioned Ginsburgs actions, saying Supreme Court justices should stay out the political fray in order to maintain their judicial integrity. The New York Times and the Washington Post chided Ginsburg in editorial articles. Judges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office. In the future I will be more circumspect, Ginsburg said. In a CNN interview posted on Tuesday, Ginsburg called the presumptive Republican nominee a faker. In a separate interview with the New York Times, Ginsburg joked about moving to New Zealand if Trump wins the White House. Under a code of conduct that federal judges - but not Supreme Court justices - are required to follow, judges are forbidden from publicly endorsing or opposing candidates for public office.  Supreme Court justices generally shy away from discussing politics or other divisive issues in public. Ginsburg is one of the more outspoken members of the court but had never before made such pointed remarks about a political candidate. The controversy erupted as Trump prepared for the opening of the July 18-21 Republican convention, which will formally make him the partys presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election. The Supreme Court has been ideologically split between four liberals and four conservatives since conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died in February. ",politicsNews,"July 14, 2016 ",1
On the sidelines of the 2016 presidential campaign,"(Reuters) - For the scores of photographers on the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign trail, capturing the characters, the color and the vibe of the election often means turning away from the speaker on the podium. The audience, the voters and the candidate are equally important, said Brian Snyder, who has been a photographer for Reuters for more than 20 years.  The voters need the candidates and the candidates need the voters. Any way you can show that visually is a good campaign picture as far as Im concerned.  Take, for example, the window full of young Bernie Sanders supporters that Snyder photographed at Bronx Community College in New York, waving to the U.S. senator from Vermont. Sanders won enthusiastic support from young people in his hard-fought race against the eventual presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. Or look at the tree with umbrellas hanging to dry on it outside a rainy Sanders rally in Buffalo, New York, after the Secret Service prevented supporters from carrying them inside. Im sure one person did it, and then the other person thought it was a good idea, and then the next thing you know, there are 30 umbrellas, Snyder said. It was just one of those funny things. Veteran Reuters photographer Mike Segar described covering this years U.S. presidential campaign as strangely fun.  In a 23-year Reuters career, Segar has covered five presidential elections, but said that this one was different, especially with New York businessman Donald Trump, who became the presumptive Republican nominee, playing a starring role. The tone of the Trump campaign makes everything different for everybody, Segar said. He added that heightened security around Trump had also impacted how photographers illustrate the campaign.        Segar took a photograph of one of his own meals when he was covering a Clinton rally: hamburger meat on a bed of undressed spinach in a tinfoil to-go container.  I was trying to give viewers a little bit of a different taste of what we see on a day to day basis, Segar said with a laugh.  Your photos dont necessarily have to capture the most earth-shattering moments of the campaign, but they have to capture peoples interest. Reuters photographer Lucas Jackson said he always looked for a different angle at rallies. In one of his photos, young reporters can be seen staring into the screens of their Macbook laptops at a Sanders rally in Pennsylvania. Usually cameras are pointed at the candidate, Jackson Said. Im always looking to add context. ",politicsNews,"July 14, 2016 ",1
New U.S. bill to tax financial trading brings campaign issue to the fore,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio on Wednesday unveiled legislation to tax financial trades that will likely wither in Congress but could stoke partisan fires in the presidential election. The Oregon Democrats bill would levy a 0.03 percent tax on most financial trades, and is intended to discourage risky trading behaviors. DeFazio expects that will collect more than $417 billion in revenue in the next decade, which he said could be used to fund free higher education or infrastructure repairs. When the Democratic Party gathers in Philadelphia for its national convention at the end of the month, it will adopt a platform that calls for taxing trades. Many liberals in the party embrace the proposal as a way to curb speculative trading, which they say led to both the 2007-09 financial crisis and the 2010 stock market flash crash. The partys left wing, led by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who ran against Hillary Clinton for the presidential nomination, meanwhile, has pushed for free university education. Thanks to the reckless greed of Wall Street over the past few decades, the American economy is a grossly unbalanced playing field, said DeFazio. The only way we can level it is if we rein in reckless speculative financial trading and curb near-instantaneous high-volume trades that create instability in the stock market and our national economy. The legislation is supported by Democratic Party stalwarts, including the AFL-CIO labor union federation, the Americans for Financial Reform coalition, the Communications Workers of America union, and advocacy group Public Citizen. The Center for Economic and Policy Research said it also backs the bill. It will likely not get far. Republicans control both chambers of Congress, and most say that Wall Street regulation passed in the aftermath of the financial crisis has been overly restrictive. In addition, the Republican Party generally favors having fewer taxes. I am opposed to any taxes that would raise the cost of financial transactions, said Randy Neugebauer, the Republican chairman of a House subcommittee on financial institutions, noting that the bill would tax stock, bond and derivatives trades.  Currently, the top U.S. securities regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, charges a tax on security futures of less than half of a penny to recover the costs of regulating markets and financial professionals. The idea for the tax can be traced back to economist John Maynard Keynes, who wrote in 1935 after another devastating financial crisis - the Great Depression - that a transfer tax on all transactions might mitigate speculation. (This version of the story corrects reference to Center for Economic and Policy Research in 7th paragraph, which had been incorrectly described as a Democratic stalwart) ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 ",1
"Factbox: Five facts about Mike Pence, Trump's running mate pick","(Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump will name Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate on Friday, U.S. news organizations reported on Thursday. Here are five facts about Pence, a Republican who previously served in the U.S. House of Representatives: Pence did not initially support Trump. Shortly before Indianas Republican primary election in May, Pence endorsed Trumps rival, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Pence praised Trump at the time, but he compared Cruz to former Republican President Ronald Reagan and called him a principled conservative. Trump won the state anyway, and Cruz dropped out of the Republican race. Trump and Pence have since met to discuss the running mate position. WELL-CONNECTED WITH DONORS Pence has strong ties to billionaire donors Charles and David Koch, including current and former staff members who have worked for them. After saying he was primarily self-funding his campaign during the Republican primaries, Trump has been holding fundraisers during the general election, with support from the Republican National Committee. The New York businessman comes to the money race at a considerable disadvantage, however, compared with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Pence sometimes describes himself as a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order. Pence in 2015 signed a religious freedom law that critics said opened the door to anti-gay discrimination. When he was in Congress, he opposed repealing the militarys Dont Ask Dont Tell policy on sexual orientation. He also has pushed restrictive abortion regulations and has pushed for Congress to defund Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit womens health provider that performs some abortions. He was a vocal opponent of the 2008 Wall Street bailout. In September 2008, Pence, then a U.S. House member, argued against the $700 billion package to stabilize the U.S. financial system, saying it would nationalize almost every bad mortgage in America.  Pence also said the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation passed in 2010 would hurt jobs. Trump has vowed to dismantle Dodd-Frank, though he has not said how he would replace it. Pence opposed allowing Syrian refugees coming to the United States to settle in Indiana. In November 2015, the governor directed state agencies to suspend the resettlement of Syrians there. A family that was supposed to arrive in December was instead sent to Connecticut. A federal judge later ruled the order clearly discriminates against refugees from a particular country. However, Pence tweeted disapproval in 2015 for plans to ban Muslims from entering the United States, an idea Trump has advocated. Pence called it offensive and unconstitutional.

Trump demands U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg resign over criticism,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump thrust the U.S. Supreme Court into the presidential campaign debate on Wednesday, rallying conservatives with a call for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to resign after she lambasted him in a series of media interviews. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee led a chorus of outrage over the comments by Ginsburg, who described Trump as a faker and speculated about the possibility of moving to New Zealand if he won the White House. In a post-midnight counterattack on Twitter, Trump said the 83-year-old leader of the courts liberal wing had embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot - resign! The furor gave Trump a cause to help galvanize conservatives divided over his unorthodox candidacy but concerned that the high court is too liberal, a mistrust fueled by recent rulings upholding racial preferences in university admissions and striking down tough abortion restrictions in Texas. In three recent interviews, Ginsburg questioned how Trump had gotten away with not turning over his tax returns and said she could not bear to think about the wealthy real estate developer winning the White House. In response, Trump said Ginsburg had politicized the Supreme Court with her comments and suggested she owed her fellow justices an apology. Im questioning her mental capacity, he told Fox News Channel on Wednesday. For her to have done that is an absolute disgrace to the Supreme Court.    Other Republicans jumped to join the attack, saying Ginsburg had proven she could not be an impartial voice on the countrys highest court. For someone on the Supreme Court who is going to be calling balls and strikes in the future based upon whatever the next president or Congress does, that strikes me as inherently biased and out of the realm, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on CNN on Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called her comments totally inappropriate, while Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said Ginsburgs statements reflected poorly on her objectivity. The New York Times and Washington Post joined in the rebukes, with the Times asking her to uphold the courts tradition of silence in political campaigns and drop the punditry and name-calling. Ginsburgs comments could push some on the right who have reservations about Trump into his camp, said Jonathan Adler, a conservative professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law who is not a Trump supporter. There are some (not me) who learn to like Trump based on the enemies he makes, he said in an email. The controversy erupted as Trump prepared for the opening of the July 18-21 Republican convention, which will formally make him the partys presidential nominee in the Nov. 8 election. Ginsburg is the senior liberal on the court, which has been ideologically split between four liberals and four conservatives since conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died in February. This gives Trump the ability to attack not only Justice Ginsburg but ultimately the authority of the Supreme Court. That is a very bad situation, said Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota Law School who served as a lawyer in the White House under Republican President George W. Bush. U.S. Supreme Court justices are not required to follow the code of judicial conduct that applies to judges on lower federal courts. The code, set by the U.S. Judicial Conference, says judges should not make speeches for a political organization or candidate, or publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office. Still, the justices typically try to stay out of the political fray. The court has a sometimes pivotal role as a judicial counterweight to the executive and legislative branches of government, deciding some of the most divisive social issues in American life. In recent years, major rulings legalized gay marriage nationwide and upheld Democratic President Barack Obamas healthcare overhaul.  In public remarks earlier this year, Chief Justice John Roberts stressed it was important for the justices not to be seen as political players, saying criticisms of partisanship, which he described as inaccurate, were damaging to the courts reputation. We dont work as Democrats or Republicans, he said. Ginsburg was not immediately available for comment on Trumps remarks and the other rebukes. The high court, whose nine justices are nominated by the U.S. president to lifetime appointments, had already been caught up in political controversy as the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate refused to take up Obamas nominee to replace Scalia, Merrick Garland. Republicans have said the next president should be allowed to nominate a replacement for Scalia. Trump has emphasized the importance of naming conservative justices to the court. The next president, potentially serving two four-year terms, could have the opportunity to appoint up to three new justices, not including Scalias replacement. Ginsburg is the oldest of the justices. Justice Anthony Kennedy turns 80 on July 23, while Justice Stephen Breyer turns 78 in August. Some Democrats defended Ginsburg, with U.S. Senator Jon Tester of Montana saying she called him (Trump) for what she saw and Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota saying, I think shes the ultimate determiner of whats appropriate and what isnt. But Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said, I dont think were well served by Supreme Court justices openly expressing their political opinions. Asked about Ginsburgs remarks, White House spokesman Josh Earnest responded with a joke referencing a nickname used widely on social media by Ginsburgs admirers. She didnt earn the nickname the Notorious R.B.G. for nothing, he said. The name was inspired by rapper Notorious B.I.G. ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 ",1
U.S. says allies oppose bill allowing 9/11 lawsuits against Saudi Arabia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. State Department officials told members of Congress on Tuesday that legislation that would allow families of Sept. 11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia is opposed by important U.S. allies and posed a national security risk. But many members of a House of Representatives Judiciary Committee subcommittee expressed strong support at a hearing for the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, which the Senate passed in May by unanimous voice vote despite President Barack Obamas veto threat. The Saudis, who deny responsibility for the 2001 attacks, strongly oppose the legislation. Other governments have also raised objections. The Dutch parliament warned that JASTA would represent a breach of Dutch sovereignty. A member of the British parliament wrote a column opposing it. Anne Patterson, the State Departments assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs, and Brian Egan, its legal counsel, testified that the measure could lead to lawsuits against the United States and discourage security cooperation such as intelligence sharing between governments. We cannot win the fight against ISIL without full international cooperation, Patterson said, using an acronym for the Islamic State militant group. But the bills supporters say it would provide justice to those who lost loved ones in the attacks 15 years ago. They argue that if Saudi Arabia was not responsible for the attacks, it would win any lawsuits. Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat who represents New York City, said worry about retaliation should not keep the measure from becoming law. That is no reason to deny justice to the victims of 9/11 and their families, he said. If it became law, JASTA would remove sovereign immunity preventing lawsuits against governments for countries found to be involved in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. It would allow survivors of the attacks, and relatives of those killed in the attacks, to seek damages from other countries. In this case, it would allow lawsuits to proceed in federal court in New York as lawyers try to prove that the Saudis were involved in the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. There was no immediate word on when the House might vote on JASTA. The House was due to adjourn later on Thursday for its summer recess and will not return to Washington until September.

European politicians wary on Republican convention over Trump,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Britains Nigel Farage will be at the Republican convention in Cleveland next week to dole out lessons from his Brexit campaign. So will Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch Freedom Party, who sees Donald Trump as an ally in his crusade to prevent an Islamization of the West. But some mainstream European conservatives who have traveled to previous Republican gatherings admit in private to being horrified at the prospect of a Trump presidency and are boycotting this years spectacle, which runs from July 18-21. Many of the center-right politicians making the trip from Europe admit to secretly rooting for Trumps Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. They are going not to support Trump, they say, but to witness the Donald in the flesh and experience what is shaping up to be one of the rowdiest, most unpredictable Republican conventions in decades. We will see whether Trump can reinvent himself at the convention, Guenter Krings, a senior lawmaker from German Chancellor Angela Merkels conservatives who will make the trip with just one other Bundestag colleague, told Reuters. One can only hope so, but I have my doubts. Politicians from around the world are invited every four years to attend the Republican and Democratic conventions as part of a formal visitors program that includes briefings with campaign managers, pollsters and foreign policy experts. They also spend time in the main convention hall. This year, nearly 120 politicians from center-right parties outside the United States are expected, roughly half of them from Europe.  Trumps candidacy has presented European parties with traditional links to U.S. Republicans with a dilemma. Many view his positions  on issues like immigration, security, trade and the divisive Brexit question  as closer to those of upstart far-right parties whose rise they are struggling to contain. Four years ago, when Mitt Romney was the Republican candidate, the center-right European Peoples Party (EPP), the largest grouping in the European Parliament, sent a delegation of eight members to Tampa. This year there will be no EPP delegation because no-one from the group expressed an interest in attending. Despite the wariness, there is a reluctance to criticize the famously thin-skinned Trump too openly, in part out of fear he could win the election in November and punish his foreign critics, as he threatened to do when David Cameron, the recently departed British prime minister, slammed Trumps proposal for a temporary U.S. ban on Muslims as divisive, stupid and wrong. While the conservative mainstream is leery, Europes array of nationalist, anti-immigration parties seem fascinated by Trump, even if some are uneasy about embracing the New York real estate businessman, who has vowed to make America great again. A spokesman for Britains UKIP party in Brussels confirmed that Farage would attend to give them some lessons on Brexit. And Wilders told Reuters that he would be in Cleveland and wanted to meet Trump there. I hope Donald Trump becomes Americas next president, Wilders said. Such a victory would be good for Europe. America and Europe are threatened by the same danger of cultural relativism and Islam. Austrias far-right Freedom Party, Frances National Front and the Alternative for Germany (AfD) are not planning to send anyone to Cleveland, the parties said. We are neutral, Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache told Reuters when asked if he supported Trump. He defends American interests. He is saying some things that need to be said.Also absent will be Italys Northern League, whose leader Matteo Salvini describes himself as an enthusiastic Trump fan but learned earlier this year that the admiration was not necessarily mutual. Salvini traveled to Pennsylvania in April to attend a Trump rally. He was photographed shaking hands with the Republican candidate and his party said Trump had endorsed Salvini to become Italian prime minister. But a month later, Trump denied in an interview ever having met Salvini and said he had no interest in doing so. Eirik Moen of the International Democrat Union, which coordinates trips to the convention by center-right politicians across the world, said that numbers could be dented this year because countries like Britain, Spain and Australia are in the midst of political transitions, making it difficult for some to travel. Still, eight British Conservatives who sit in the European Parliament are expected to be in Cleveland. On the continent, Frances main center-right party, les Republicains, is not sending a delegation. And the contingent from Merkels Christian Democrats (CDU) is unusually small. In Germany, political debate is conducted in a sober, reserved manner and personal attacks are rare, even during election campaigns. Hence the mix of shock and horror at the tone of the U.S. race. Trump has dismissed Merkel as insane for letting hundreds of thousands of refugees into the country. And his idea to build a wall along the Mexican border elicits shudders in Berlin, a city that was divided by its own wall for nearly three decades and will celebrate the 27th anniversary of its fall a day after U.S. voters cast their ballots on Nov. 8. Many of Donald Trumps positions  for example his stance toward Muslims, toward immigration from Mexico and gun ownership  are simply not compatible with the positions of the conservatives and other parties in Germany, said Juergen Hardt, a CDU lawmaker who also acts as the governments coordinator for transatlantic relations. Hardt said he is planning to go on vacation with his family next week and wont be able to attend the convention. ",politicsNews,"July 14, 2016 ",1
"U.S. presidential race tied, Clinton hurt by emails: poll","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. presidential race is tied going into the major parties national conventions and Democrat Hillary Clinton has been damaged by the FBI investigation into her email use while secretary of state, a new opinion poll showed on Thursday. The New York Times/CBS News poll showed 67 percent of voters surveyed said Clinton was not honest and trustworthy, up 5 percentage points from a CBS poll conducted last month before the FBI made its findings public. As Donald Trump prepares to accept the Republican presidential nomination next week, the poll showed him in a dead heat with Clinton in a general election matchup. Each candidate drew 40 percent of the vote, compared with the 6 percentage point lead enjoyed by Clinton in last months survey, the poll showed. The margin of error was 3 percentage points in the CBS News/New York Times poll, which was conducted by telephone July 8-12 among a random sample of 1,600 adults nationwide, including 1,358 registered voters.   The survey showed 62 percent of voters surveyed distrust Trump as well. But Mrs. Clintons shifting and inaccurate explanations of her email practices at the State Department appear to have resonated more deeply with the electorate, the Times wrote. FBI Director James Comey said last week Clinton was extremely careless in the handling of classified information but the investigation found no evidence she or her colleagues intended to violate laws. The Times/CBS poll echoes the finding of a Quinnipiac Poll released on Wednesday that showed Trump pulling just ahead of Clinton in the so-called swing states of Florida and Pennsylvania as the former U.S. senator and first lady lost ground on honesty and moral standards. In contrast to the New York Times/CBS News poll, a Reuters/Ipsos online opinion poll released on Tuesday showed Clinton leading Trump by 13 points at a national level, with 46 percent to Trumps 33 percent support among likely voters.

U.S. aims for start this year on buying more military satellites,"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force has developed a new framework for assessing the resilience of its satellites that should allow it to start the acquisition process for more military communication and missile detection satellites this autumn, a senior official said at the Farnborough Airshow this week. Lockheed Martin, Boeing Co, Northrop Grumman Corp and Raytheon Co are keeping a close eye on these satellite programs, which could be worth billions of dollars and represent the first big new business opportunities in the military space market for some time. U.S. officials have grown increasingly concerned about the need to protect their military satellites - which are critical to being able to identify targets, navigate, communicate and operate drones - given the growing use of electronic jammers and other threats. Winston Beauchamp, the U.S. Air Force deputy undersecretary for space, told Reuters that officials had developed a new set of criteria over the past year to help military leaders determine their options for more satellites. The Air Force had previously looked at the options for follow-on satellites in both programs but until now had not included specific criteria for their resilience, or their ability to operate in the face of hostile action or adverse conditions, such as electromagnetic interference. Beauchamp said senior Pentagon leaders last week endorsed the work done so far on the framework and further work planned before it is presented to Defense Secretary Ash Carter for approval in the fall. Once that decision is made, the Air Force hopes to begin the long-awaited acquisition process to buy follow-on satellites for the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system built by Lockheed Martin for protected satellite communications, and new missile warning satellites, also currently built by Lockheed under the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) program. Work was already underway on the acquisition strategy for each of the two programs so they could begin shortly after the resilience decision this autumn, Beauchamp said. The U.S. Air Force was also focused on increasing coordination and planning among allies for its space operations, as well as more multilateral wargaming and work on developing rules of engagement and joint concepts of operations. We are thinking more broadly about how to conduct operations in a joint manner, Beauchamp said. In the past it was tacked on at the end. But wed like to find a way to shift the planning to the left in a number of areas. ",politicsNews,"July 14, 2016 ",1
Report accuses Tennessee lawmaker of inappropriate sexual conduct,"(Reuters) - A Tennessee state lawmaker was accused of inappropriate sexual conduct with 22 women over a four-year period in a state attorney generals report released on Wednesday.  Republican Representative Jeremy Durham repeatedly made unwelcomed advances toward female legislative staff, interns and lobbyists since being elected in 2012, according to a report issued to a legislative committee investigating his conduct. Durham declined to be interviewed by investigators, the report said, and he was not immediately available for comment. The investigation has been a politically motivated, unfair and unconstitutional process, said Durhams attorney Bill Harbison in a statement to the Nashville CBS affiliate News Channel 5. The report details interviews with 22 unnamed women who described numerous occasions when the married legislator flirted and made suggestive sexual comments or physical advances toward them.  In one case, Durham had sex with an 20-year-old campaign worker in his legislative office and again in his home. On several occasions, he sent text messages or used social media to make inappropriate comments to several women.  One of the women described the messages as terribly inappropriate while another said his behavior creeped her out. A lobbyist told investigators that Durham suggested he would vote for a bill she was promoting if she entertained his advances. Im for your bill but Im going to expect something in return, he told her according to the report.  In a memo attached to the report, the committee said it will leave Durhams fate to the voters as he is up for re-election in November.  ",politicsNews,"July 14, 2016 ",1
CIA director says he would resign if ordered to resume waterboarding,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - CIA Director John Brennan said on Wednesday he would resign if the next president ordered his agency to resume waterboarding suspected militants, an apparent reference to comments by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump embracing the banned interrogation method. I can say that as long as Im director of CIA, irrespective of what the president says, Im not going to be the director of CIA that gives that order. Theyll have to find another director, said Brennan, who did not mention Trump by name. Brennan, who has been director since 2013, tacked his comment to the end of his response to a question about drone strike policy after speaking at the Brookings Institution, a Washington policy institute.Brennan said previously he would refuse to resume the practice, which simulates drowning and was used by the CIA on three suspected militants detained in secret foreign prisons during President George W. Bushs administration. But his pledge to resign if ordered to revive waterboarding was his most emphatic affirmation of his position to date. Trump, set to be formally nominated next week as the Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election, has said he would reauthorize waterboarding immediately if elected, contending that torture works. At an April 20 rally in Indianapolis, he recalled being asked about waterboarding during a debate the previous week. They asked me: What do you think about waterboarding, Mr. Trump? I said I love it. I love it, I think its great. And I said the only thing is, we should make it much tougher than waterboarding, he said. Democratic President Barack Obama signed an executive order after taking office in January 2009 that banned waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques, or EITs. Such executive orders can be rescinded by a presidents successors. Obama, other top U.S. officials, many lawmakers and human rights groups have denounced waterboarding as torture. Some former Bush administration and CIA officials have defended waterboarding and other EITs, denying they are torture and saying they elicited valuable intelligence. Brennan told his confirmation hearing in 2013 he had not tried to stop harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding when he was at the spy agency earlier in his career, but had objected to them privately. A Senate Intelligence Committee study, issued in 2014, concluded that EITs failed to elicit any significant intelligence. Brennan said on Wednesday it was not possible to establish cause and effect between the use of EITs and the acquisition of reliable information. ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 ",1
Clinton says Trump is most divisive candidate 'in our lifetimes',"In a speech weighted with Americas complicated racial history, Democrat Hillary Clinton laced into Republican presidential rival Donald Trump on Wednesday, accusing him of fueling divisions among Americans over race and religion. His campaign is as divisive as any we have seen in our lifetimes, Clinton said at a campaign appearance at the Illinois state house in Springfield. It is built on stoking mistrust and pitting American against American. Its there in everything he says and everything he promises to do as president. Clinton ticked off Trumps proposals to ban Muslims from entering the country, create a database of Muslims already in the country and step up deportations by creating a special deportation force as policies intended to drive Americans apart. She lambasted Trumps decision to re-tweet an image from a neo-Nazi and his statements about women. We need a president who can help pull us together, not split us apart, Clinton said. The two presumptive nominees are heading into July nominating conventions where they are to formally become the Democratic and Republican candidates who will square off in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Clintons speech comes a week after a sniper shot and killed five Dallas police officers during a protest of police killings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota. She addressed these incidents and other race-related deaths in Springfield. Clintons speech on Wednesday carried the echo of history. The state house in the Illinois capital of Springfield was the site where President Abraham Lincoln delivered an anti-slavery speech during his campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1858, warning that a house divided against itself cannot stand. As the 16th president of the United States, he went on to guide the country through most of the Civil War. Clinton acknowledged that while the challenges we face today do not approach those of Lincolns time, the countrys long struggle with race is far from finished.  The Illinois state house is also where President Barack Obama, the first African-American to hold the highest office in America, launched his first campaign for president in 2007. Trump spent months trying to discredit the citizenship and legitimacy of our first black president, Clinton said.  Trump was loudly fixated on the issue of Obamas birthplace during the 2012 presidential campaign and had also suggested that Obama was a Muslim, despite clear evidence that the president was born in Hawaii and is a Christian. Clinton acknowledged that she has made some missteps on race. She faced early criticism from the Black Lives Matter movement for past statements, such as one in the 1990s, when she was first lady, calling violent minority youth super predators. She told the Washington Post earlier this year that she shouldnt have used those words. As someone in the middle of a hotly fought political campaign I cannot stand here and claim that my words and actions havent sometimes fueled the partisanship that often stands in the way of progress, so I recognize I have to do better, too, she added.

Obama to sign bill to battle heroin addiction,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama will sign legislation passed by Congress aimed at combating a nationwide epidemic of heroin and other opioid addictions, the White House said on Wednesday. After months of wrangling, the Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday, 92-2, to pass the bill that has also been approved by the U.S. House of Representatives. The measure aims to help communities develop treatment and overdose programs at a time when fewer than half the estimated 2.2 million Americans who need help for opioid abuse are receiving it, according to the U.S. Centers for Human and Health Services. The White House said in a statement the bill falls far short of the necessary funding, but Obama would sign it because some action is better than none. Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a leading proponent of the legislation, said that it marked the first time that weve treated addiction like the disease that it is, which will help put an end to the stigma that has surrounded addiction for too long. While its passage marked a rare bipartisan effort in this election year, Democrats complained that it does not provide  enough resources to effectively address the drug problem. This bill is like a Hollywood movie set - something that appears real on the surface but has no substance and no life behind its facade, said Senator Charles Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat. U.S. deaths from drug overdoses hit a record high in 2014, propelled by abuse of prescription painkillers and heroin, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 28,000 people died from opioid overdose in 2014. At least half, HHS said, of those deaths involved a prescription opioid. Among the common prescription drugs are oxycodone, hydrocodone, and fentanyl that are used for pain treatment. Heroin-related deaths have also increased sharply, more than tripling since 2010. In 2014, more than 10,500 people died from heroin, the agency said. The bill authorizes $181 million a year for new programs it creates. Democrats said that with disagreements in Congress over next years funding for HHS, it was uncertain whether the money contained in the bipartisan bill actually would be delivered.  They called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, to back up this legislation with $600 million in immediate emergency funds. Obama has requested $920 million for opioid treatment programs over two years. The bill, if enacted into law, also would provide new training for emergency personnel in administering drugs to reverse opioid overdoses and help communities purchase those drugs.

House votes to bar heavy water purchases from Iran,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House of Representatives passed legislation on Wednesday to block the purchase of heavy water from Iran, defying President Barack Obamas veto threat a year after the announcement of the landmark Iran nuclear agreement. The House passed the No 2H2O from Iran Act by 249-176, with support coming almost exclusively from Republicans, who hold a majority of seats in the chamber. Every congressional Republican, and a few of Obamas fellow Democrats, opposed the nuclear deal between Iran and the United States and other world powers announced last July 14 in which Tehran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for relief from crippling international sanctions. They argued that Obama was so eager to bolster his foreign policy legacy that he agreed to sanctions relief Iran did not deserve because it lied about its nuclear program, supported militant groups that attack U.S. allies and perpetrated human rights abuses. Deal opponents have repeatedly introduced legislation that the administration sees as efforts to undermine the international agreement. Deal supporters said the agreement was the best way to defuse a dispute over Irans nuclear program that threatened further Middle East destabilization. Heavy water is a non-radioactive byproduct from making nuclear weapons and nuclear energy. The Obama administration said in April the United States would buy $8.6 million worth of heavy water from Iran, angering Republicans who called it a subsidy of the countrys nuclear program. The White House issued a threat on Monday to veto the bill, and two others the House is due to consider later this week. Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, denied that the House measure would violate the landmark pact. He said it would deter Iran from producing heavy water by making its sale more difficult. Separately, two Senate Republicans and two Democrats said on Wednesday they would introduce their own Iran-related bill. The measure introduced by Republicans Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Marco Rubio and Democrats Robert Menendez and Joe Manchin would expand sanctions for Irans ballistic missile development, sanction transfers of conventional weapons to or from Iran and extend the Iran Sanctions Act. The Iran Sanctions Act, which imposed sanctions over Irans missile development and support for terrorism, expires at the end of 2016. Lawmakers have been in discussions for months over the best way to address its renewal. ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 ",1
U.S. judge to mull release of Trump video testimony,"SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel said on Wednesday he would take more time to decide whether video excerpts of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump answering questions under oath about his Trump University seminars should be made public. Curiel is overseeing two class-action lawsuits in San Diego over the real estate seminar venture. A separate fraud case by New York states attorney general is pending. Trump has suggested Curiel is biased against him because of his campaign rhetoric about illegal immigration. Curiel was born in Indiana but is of Mexican descent.  On Wednesday, Trumps lawyers fought release of the videos, arguing that they would be exploited during the presidential campaign. Theres all kinds of potential for mischief, Daniel Petrocelli, a lawyer for Trump, told Curiel.  Jason Forge, a lawyer for the students who claim they were misled and defrauded by Trump University, said Petrocelli could not point to any particular harm if the videos are released since transcripts are already public. The lawsuits accuse Trump of bilking students who paid as much as $35,000 each to learn his real estate investment strategies. The students claim they learned little. Trump has claimed a majority of students were satisfied with the seminars. ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 ",1
House Republican group moves to impeach IRS chief: Politico,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives has filed a measure aimed at forcing a vote to impeach Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen, a newspaper reported on Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the plans by the House Freedom Caucus. Members of the group had told House Speaker Paul Ryan they would file a privileged resolution, effectively sidestepping leaders in the Republican-dominated chamber, if he did not agree to start impeachment proceedings in the House Judiciary committee, Politico reported.  Ryan has declined to do so because of doubts the judiciary panel can make an impeachment case against Koskinen. Politico said Louisiana Representative John Fleming filed the motion. Koskinen faces allegations from the judiciary panel of ignoring congressional subpoenas and misleading lawmakers. The accusations stem from a 2013 case in which Republican lawmakers said the IRS scrutinized more conservative groups than liberal organizations in applications for tax-exempt status.

Obama plan to stop tax inversions stirs U.S. business concerns,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administrations plan to prevent American companies from shifting their headquarters overseas to avoid U.S. taxes is coming under fire from companies and banks that say it would be costly and cumbersome. At issue are proposed Treasury regulations to combat earnings stripping, a key goal for companies that carry out tax-avoiding mergers known as inversions to reincorporate abroad, if only on paper, to cut their taxes. The practice effectively shifts taxable earnings from U.S. operations to the redomiciled former American parent as debt interest payments that are tax deductible in the United States and subject to a lower income tax rate overseas.  The Treasury Department is scheduled to hold a public hearing on the proposed changes on Thursday. The administrations proposals, which could be finalized within months, have already dampened interest in global mergers. The proposals are backed by Democrats in Congress and academics as a responsible step to prevent corporations from exiting the U.S. tax system. Republicans say the measures overstep administration authority and could discourage foreign investment in the United States.  Businesses and trade groups representing sectors ranging from bankers and retailers to manufacturers and oil producers said a Treasury proposal to end the deductions by reclassifying the debt as equity would disrupt operations and saddle businesses with new red tape. U.S. multinational Procter & Gamble Co warned Treasury the proposed rules would require countless changes throughout its corporate structure if myriad daily loans between affiliates were recharacterized as equity investments. It will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to monitor and administer, P&Gs Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told the Internal Revenue Service in a letter before the regulatory comment period ended last week.  He warned that the company would face pre-tax costs of $220 million to $340 million a year as a result of adverse tax consequences and burdens. The regulations would also pose challenges for intercompany loans key to the financial services industry, according to Citicorp, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp, which filed a joint comment with the Treasury.  A financial services group would face the choice between, on the one hand, staggering administrative complexities and a tax burden disproportionate to its true economic profit, and on the other hand, the imposition of crippling constraints on its ordinary business activities, said the banks, which seek an industry exemption. A Treasury spokeswoman said officials could respond to the feedback but added the department was moving swiftly to finalize regulations. ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 ",1
Trump seeks $10 million from former adviser in campaign legal dispute,"(Reuters) - Republican White House hopeful Donald Trump is seeking $10 million in damages from a fired former employee, shedding light on a campaign that has at times seen high-profile exits and internal fights spill over into public view. Trump in May started arbitration proceedings against Sam Nunberg, a former adviser who was fired in 2015, accusing him of violating a confidentiality agreement, according to a court filing obtained by Reuters.     He has a confidentiality agreement which he has repeatedly breached, and weve taken action to enforce it, said Alan Garten, general counsel with the Trump Organization who is representing the campaign in the arbitration.  Nunberg did not respond to a request for comment. The flare-up comes after a period in which campaign in-fighting led Trump to fire some top aides, including national political director Rick Wiley and campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Other staffers have separately resigned from Trumps campaign. Trumps legal conflicts, which also include a lawsuit over his Trump University real-estate seminars, have at times distracted public attention from his campaign. Nunberg in court documents dated Tuesday accused Trump of starting arbitration proceedings to retaliate against him for switching his support to rival presidential hopeful Ted Cruz during the Republican primaries. Cruz dropped out of the race in early May. Garten said the suit was unrelated. Nunberg also said Trump tried to use the arbitration to cover up media coverage of an apparent affair between two members of his presidential campaign staff. The Trump campaign is attempting to bring a frivolous and retaliatory arbitration proceeding against me essentially to punish me and shut me up, Nunberg said in an affidavit accompanying his petition to halt the arbitration proceedings.  The petition was filed on Tuesday in New York state court in Manhattan. The Trump campaign fired Nunberg in August 2015 after the discovery of Facebook posts that critics deemed racist. Nunberg at the time denied he wrote the posts. He said in the court filings that Trump accused him of being the source for a New York Post story in May that recounted a public argument between Lewandowski, who was then with the campaign, and Hope Hicks, Trumps spokeswoman. In the affidavit, Nunberg said the argument was part of an sordid and apparently illicit affair between the two. He denied being the source for the New York Post story, saying the argument occurred in public and others saw it. Garten called the allegation categorically untrue and said Nunberg had recently asked for his job back. This is an individual who time and time again has demonstrated that he will say anything that is outrageous, regardless of whether its factually accurate, to get his name out there and create trouble, Garten said. Hicks and Lewandowski did not respond to requests for comment. ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 ",1
U.S. Senate approves bill to upgrade airport security,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Wednesday approved a bill that would upgrade security at U.S. airports in the aftermath of the Brussels and Istanbul attacks while extending funds for the Federal Aviation Administration for another 14 months. In an 89-to-4 vote, the lawmakers sent the legislation on to the White House for President Barack Obamas signature. The House of Representatives approved the same measure on Monday. It includes provisions that require tougher vetting of aviation workers with access to secure airport areas, expedited security checks to move passengers more quickly from airport areas that are not secured and a larger number of police dogs for security duty in the U.S. transportation system. It extends the current level of federal funding for FAA programs through September 2017. Congress has been struggling to find agreement on a more comprehensive package to reauthorize the U.S. aviation regulatory agency. A measure that would have provided FAA funding over six years stalled in the House earlier this year, amid disagreement over a proposal to privatize the U.S. air traffic control system. The House later failed to take up a Senate reauthorization bill but added security features from that measure into the legislation approved this week. House Republicans say they intend to use the time between now and September 2017 to find ways to move the privatization plan forward.  A Turkish court has jailed seven suspects pending trial on terrorism charges over last months triple suicide bombing at Istanbuls main airport. The attack killed 45 people. Islamic State suicide bombers killed 16 people at Brussels airport - as well as 16 on a Brussels metro train - on March 22 this year. ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 ",1
"House panel subpoenas New York, Massachusetts attorneys general","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives panel on Wednesday issued subpoenas to the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts to force them to submit information on their investigations into whether Exxon Mobil misled investors on climate change risks, accusing the attorneys general of having a political agenda.  The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology also subpoenaed eight environmental and legal groups. The attorneys general have appointed themselves to decide what is valid and what is invalid regarding climate change, committee Chair Lamar Smith, a Republican of Texas, said. He said the attorneys general are pursuing a political agenda at the expense of scientists right to free speech. The panel has demanded that state attorneys general hand over any records of consultations the prosecutors had with outside environmental groups before their probes were opened. New York and Massachusetts top lawyers lead a coalition of 17 state attorneys general who have said they would investigate Exxon and whether its executives misled the public by contradicting research from company scientists that spelled out the threats of global warming.    Smith and Republican members of the House panel have accused the coalitions members of stifling free speech and scientific inquiry by those who do not believe in manmade climate change. I dont know what we will find, Smith told reporters. We might find an intent to intimidate.  So far, New York and Massachusetts have issued subpoenas against Exxon Mobil, one of the worlds largest publicly traded companies.  The House committee twice demanded that the state attorneys general hand over all records of communications between their offices and outside groups about Exxon inquiries. Darin LaHood, a Republican of Illinois on the panel, said on Wednesday that the probe by the attorneys general prohibits free speech in a way you would see in a third world country. Cyndi Roy Gonzalez, the spokeswoman for the Massachusetts attorney generals office, said in a statement that Smiths committee has no right to interfere with ... a state inquiry into whether a private company violated state laws, and we will continue to fight any and all efforts to stop our investigation. Green groups Greenpeace and 350.org made similar criticisms in a letter to Smith. Exxon, which has said that it has acknowledged the reality of climate change for years, called the subpoena unreasonably burdensome and intrusive. It also raised questioned about jurisdiction.  The attorneys general and the groups have two weeks to respond. ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 ",1
Trump pulls just ahead in two key U.S. states: poll,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump pulled ahead of Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton in Florida and Pennsylvania in a Quinnipiac Poll released on Wednesday that included responses after the FBI released its findings on Clintons email use. Clinton lost ground on honesty and moral standards in the poll that showed tight races in Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio, all swing states that could go to either party in Novembers presidential election. The Quinnipiac Poll, taken from June 30 to July 11, showed Trump competitive in the three states a week before the start of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland that will formally nominate him as the partys presidential candidate for the Nov. 8 election. Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the poll, said there was no definite link between Clintons drop in Florida from Quinnipiacs June 21 survey and the FBIs findings that she was careless in her handling of government emails while U.S. secretary of state. But he said Clinton lost ground to Trump on questions that measure moral standards and honesty. Clinton lost an 8-point lead in Florida, where Trump won 42 percent to Clintons 39 percent, according to the Quinnipiac Poll. In Ohio, the poll showed the candidates tied at 41 percent.  In Pennsylvania, the Quinnipiac poll showed Trump with 43 percent to Clintons 41 percent. A NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released this week showed a very different result in Pennsylvania, with Clinton leading Trump 45 to 36 percent. The July 5-10 poll included 829 registered voters and has a margin of error of 3 percentage points. Nationally, Clinton leads Trump by 13 percentage points, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday. The online poll showed that 46 percent of likely voters support Clinton while 33 percent support Trump. The July 8-12 included 1,146 likely voters and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. FBI Director James Comey said last week Clinton was extremely careless in the handling of classified information but the investigation found no evidence she or her colleagues intended to violate laws. Clinton, a former U.S. senator and first lady, has faced heavy criticism from Republicans for her use of private email servers for government business while she led the State Department from 2009 to 2013. The Quinnipiac poll was conducted by telephone with people who identified as registered voters. It included 1,015 people in Florida, 955 people in Ohio and 982 people in Pennsylvania. The margin of error was around three percentage points in all three states. ",politicsNews,"July 13, 2016 ",1
Former Senator Evan Bayh announces run for Senate,"(Reuters) - Former Democratic Senator and Indiana Governor Evan Bayh announced on Wednesday that he will come out of retirement to run for the U.S. Senate, a move that could determine whether Democrats can take control of the upper chamber in November.  With the challenges facing Indiana and our country, I can no longer sit on the sidelines and watch as partisan bickering grinds Washington to a halt, Bayh said in a statement announcing his candidacy.  Bayh served two terms in the Senate before announcing his retirement in 2010. He has maintained a campaign account with more than $9.2 million cash on hand. The Republican candidate, Todd Young, has a campaign account with more than $1 million. Fellow Democrat Baron Hill cleared the way for Bayh to run on Monday when he announced that he was leaving the Senate race.

"Responding to criticism, Trump calls on Justice Ginsburg to resign","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential contender Donald Trump called on Wednesday for the resignation of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, describing her as mentally unfit after she lambasted him in a series of media interviews. Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me, Trump said in a Twitter post. Her mind is shot - resign!  The New York billionaire chided Ginsburg, 83, for criticizing him this week and expressing concern for the countrys future if he is elected in November. Trump said it was inappropriate for Supreme Court justices to weigh in on political campaigns. He told the New York Times on Tuesday that he thought it was a disgrace to the court and that Ginsburg should apologize to her colleagues on the bench.  Trump was not alone in the rebuke. In an editorial on Wednesday, the New York Times urged Ginsburg to uphold the courts tradition of silence in political campaigns. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg needs to drop the political punditry and the name-calling, the editorial said.  The Times said there was no legal requirement that Supreme Court justices keep silent on political campaigns, but it expressed concern that Ginsburg would jeopardize her own commitment to impartiality. Ginsburg was not immediately available for comment on Trumps remarks and the editorial. In a CNN interview posted on Tuesday, Ginsburg called Trump a faker. He has no consistency about him, she said. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego.  How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? The press seems to be very gentle with him on that. Earlier, Ginsburg joked about moving to New Zealand if Trump wins the White House. I cant imagine what this place would be - I cant imagine what the country would be  with Donald Trump as our president, she said in a New York Times interview published on Sunday. Trump adviser Sam Clovis told CNN on Wednesday that Ginsburgs comments were out of character for Supreme Court justices but should not have been surprising. She has always been a firebrand, he said.

New Black Panther Party says to carry arms in Cleveland if legal,"(Reuters) - The New Black Panther Party, a black power movement, will carry firearms for self-defense during rallies in Cleveland ahead of next weeks Republican convention, if allowed under Ohio law, the groups chairman said.  The plan by the group this weekend comes as police in Cleveland brace for an influx of groups that plan demonstrations before and during the presidential nominating convention.  During the attack last week in Dallas that killed five police officers, law enforcement officials said demonstrators carrying rifles led them to initially believe they were under attack by multiple shooters. Several other groups, including some supporters ofpresumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, have said they will carry weapons in Cleveland. If it is an open state to carry, we will exercise our second amendment rights because there are other groups threatening to be there that are threatening to do harm to us, Hashim Nzinga, chairman of the New Black Panther Party, told Reuters in a telephone interview.  If that state allows us to bear arms, the Panthers and the others who can legally bear arms will bear arms. Nzinga said he condemned the Dallas shootings. Officials in Ohio have said it will be legal for protesters to carry weapons at demonstrations outside the convention under that states open carry law, which allows civilians to carry guns in public.  Black power groups promote defense against racial oppression, with some advocating for the establishment of armed self-defense groups, black social institutions and a self-sufficient economy. The New Black Panther Party has long called for a separate black nation. But Nzinga said the movement was now focused on protecting black Americans rights. Academics say the New Black Panther Party remains marginal and largely representative of an older generation, in their 30s and 40s, rather than younger activists drawn to groups such as the anti-racism Black Lives Matter movement. The New Black Panther Party was founded in 1989 and adopted a more radical approach than the 1960s Black Panther Party. Members of the original group have denounced the New Black Panther Party as racist, but Nzinga says his movement includes original Black Panthers. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate group watchdog, describes the New Black Panther Party as a virulently racist and anti-Semitic organization whose leaders have encouraged violence against whites, Jews and law enforcement officers. The center tracks years of public statements by the New Black Panther Party and other groups. Nzinga denied the group was racist but said it was a fact that Jews control Hollywood and the U.S. media. The center said the group is not known to have carried out any violent attacks. The black shooter in the Dallas killings liked the New Black Panthers and other black nationalist groups on Facebook but was not a member.   Nzinga said he expected a couple hundred members of the New Black Panther Party to participate in and protect a black unity rally  the National Convention of the Oppressed  that is scheduled to begin in Cleveland on Thursday evening and end on Monday morning. Nzinga said he and the Panthers plan to leave Cleveland on Sunday, the day before the convention officially opens.  We are there to protect ... We are not trying to do anything else, he said. We are going to carry out some ofthese great legal rights we have  to assemble, to protest and (to exercise) freedom of speech. Nzinga says his group has grown amid racial tensions in the wake of a series of high-profile police killings of black men in the past two years. The Southern Poverty Law Center says the number of black militant chapters around the country grew from 113 in 2014 to 180 in 2015.  The center says there are 892 hate groups total nationwide. It says white hate groups, such as the Aryan Brotherhood, have a much longer track record of carrying out violent attacks than black nationalist groups. Nzinga said his group has 36 chapters nationwide but declined to reveal membership numbers. I have people literally calling me saying this is the first time in my life I protested and I loved it. Nzinga told Reuters. They want to be a part of something. They tried to be a part of the system and the system let them down so they want to be part of a rebellion. ",politicsNews,"July 12, 2016 ",1
Clinton extends lead over Trump to 13 points: Reuters/Ipsos,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton extended her lead over Republican rival Donald Trump to 13 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday, up from 10 points at the end of last week. The July 8-12 poll showed 46 percent of likely voters supported Clinton, the former secretary of state, while 33 percent supported Trump, a celebrity real estate developer. Another 21 percent did not support either candidate. That compared with 45 percent who supported Clinton and 35 percent who supported Trump in the five days to July 8.  Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has mostly led in the national online poll this year. The last time Trump came close to Clintons popularity was in early May, when his last two rivals for the Republican nomination dropped out of the race and party leaders started to line up behind his campaign. Trump, who is expected to become the official Republican nominee at the partys convention next week, has since lost ground in the poll as he struggled to refocus his campaign from the Republican nominating contests to the Nov. 8 general election.  Over the past several weeks, Trump has faced criticism for his past business dealings and has quarreled with Republican leaders over his rejection of international trade agreements and his promises to crack down on immigration. Clinton, meanwhile, has been dogged by criticisms of how she handled classified information as secretary of state.  James Comey, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said last week that Clinton and her staff were extremely careless with sensitive information but recommended that the government not seek criminal charges against her.  Still, Americans have become increasingly positive about Clinton this month, with half of likely voters now saying they have a favorable view of her, according to the poll, up from 46 percent on July 1. Some 60 percent of likely voters have an unfavorable view of Trump, compared with 58 percent on July 1. The Reuters/Ipsos poll surveyed 1,146 likely voters across the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.

Clinton vetting retired U.S. Navy Admiral Stavridis for VP: source,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clintons campaign is vetting retired Navy Admiral James Stavridis as a potential vice presidential running mate, a source with knowledge of the process told Reuters on Tuesday. Stavridis is dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University near Boston and a former supreme allied commander of NATO.  Admiral Stavridis is one of the finest military officers of his generation, Michele Flournoy, a former under secretary at the U.S. Department of Defense, told Reuters in a statement. He is a person of great ability and integrity, and an exceptional leader. He has the talents, experience, judgment and temperament to serve the American people at the highest levels of our government. The Clinton campaign declined to comment on the vetting of Stavridis. Stavridis likewise declined to comment on the process. Flournoy, who formed a think tank after leaving the Defense Department and is advising the Clinton campaign on foreign policy, also did not comment on the vetting process. Flournoy is thought to be a probable Clinton pick for defense secretary if the presumptive Democratic nominee wins the White House on Nov. 8. Stavridis and Clinton worked closely together when he was at NATO and she led the U.S. State Department during Democratic President Barack Obamas first term. Introducing Clinton at a 2013 awards dinner, Stavridis said, She does the work of two, of 20, of 200 with her energy, with her enthusiasm and with her boundless determination to improve our world, and praised her use of smart power. In a 2012 TED talk on global security, Stavridis began by saying: My thesis for us today is, instead of building walls to create security, we need to build bridges. Clinton has used similar rhetoric about the role of international diplomacy on the campaign trail. Stravidis was senior military assistant to former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in the George W. Bush administration during the early years of the U.S. occupation of Iraq. That could provide presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump with a line of political attack.  Trump has throughout the campaign criticized Clinton for, as a U.S. senator, voting in favor of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Trump expressed early concerns about the operations cost. Another political millstone could be a 2012 Defense Department inspector generals report that said Stavridis had failed to obtain prior authorization to use a government aircraft during an unofficial trip and submitted improper travel expenses. Stavridis was cleared of misconduct. Stavridis would bring military heft to Clintons presidential ticket. Trump is considering Michael Flynn, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, for the No. 2 spot. Flynn, a Democrat who is nonetheless fiercely critical of Obamas foreign policy, would be an unconventional choice for Trump. The wealthy New York businessman is formally vetting former U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Indiana Governor Mike Pence.  Other potential vice presidential picks said to be on Clintons short list are U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tim Kaine of Virginia, according to news reports. Clinton campaigned alongside Warren in Ohio last month and is set to campaign with Kaine in his home state on Thursday. Her campaign has not confirmed that either is being formally vetted.

Puerto Rico's fiscal challenges not over: governor,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Puerto Rico, the U.S. commonwealth that recently declared a historic default, could be shut out of debt markets for two more years as it battles with fiscal challenges, the islands governor said on Tuesday. Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said emergency fiscal measures in response to a $70 billion debt were not sustainable and that Puerto Rico will not endure any more austerity.   He said a new law enacted by Washington allowing the federal government to appoint a control board would undercut self-government, but added it would help the island confront its fiscal problems. Our challenges are not over and prosperity will not return overnight, the governor said during a discussion at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington. It will take maybe two years until the market opens back to Puerto Rico if we do the right thing, Garcia Padilla said, adding the government had been producing fiscally sound budgets that would help win back creditors. The island has been shut out of debt markets for about a year. Citing falling debt levels, he said it was a moment of opportunity in Puerto Rico, which has struggled with high debt loads and a weak economy for years.  Puerto Rico defaulted on $779 million of constitutionally backed debt on July 1, among its most senior bonds, opting to pay for essential services for its citizens over obligations to creditors.  Garcia Padilla said the Puerto Rican government would take steps on its own to get its fiscal affairs in order, therefore minimizing meddling by the oversight board. For example, he said that if the islands government passed responsible budgets on its own, the control board would not need to impose its own fiscal plans. Garcia Padilla said, however, that while the government must become more efficient to improve its fiscal situation, that should be done through attrition rather than laying off workers. Asked by a reporter about steps that could be taken to shore up the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or PREPA, and the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, or PRASA, Garcia Padilla said: PREPA is pretty advanced. Well be able to reduce a lot the debt related to PREPA. We want to do the same with PRASA. I think well be able to do it. ",politicsNews,"July 12, 2016 ",1
U.S. Senate votes to hammer out deal with House on energy measure,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday voted to work on a compromise with the House of Representatives on what could become the broad energy legislation passed by Congress in nearly a decade.  The Senate voted 84 to 3 to go to formal conference with the House on legislation to take modest steps on modernizing the power grid, speeding the permitting of exports of liquefied natural gas, and increasing research and funding for energy efficiency and batteries.  Congress is slated to begin summer recess on Friday and the conference is expected to work on the compromise energy legislation after returning in September. Senators who will work with House lawmakers on a deal in conference include Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican in the chamber.   The Senate energy bill passed in April, while the House energy bill passed last year.  Lawmakers in the House have removed items such as limits on energy efficiency that the White House has said Obama would veto. Among items to be worked out between the two chambers will be the speed of LNG export permitting process. The Senate version of the bill limits federal reviews to 45 days while the House version limits them to 30 days.  My objective here is to deliver a law, Senator Lisa Murkowski, the chairman of the Senate energy committee, said about the conference process, shortly before the measure passed. Before becoming a law, an agreement worked out in conference would have to be passed by both chambers and signed by Obama.  Industry group the American Petroleum Institute praised the step, saying the bill would boost U.S. energy infrastructure and ensure that American natural gas has a dominant place on the world market. Environmental group the League of Conservation Voters welcomed progress on the debate on energy efficiency but warned that some of the potential measures to be discussed in conference will not amount to the true overhaul our energy sector needs. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives debated a bill to fund the Interior Department and Environmental Protection Agency. The White House on Monday said Obama would veto that measure if it passes because it underfunds key Department of Interior programs and slashes the EPAs operating budget.

Clinton gets Sanders endorsement in show of party unity,"PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (Reuters) - Democrat Bernie Sanders endorsed former rival Hillary Clinton for president in a display of party unity on Tuesday, describing her as the best candidate to fix the United States problems and beat Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election. With Clinton nodding in agreement beside him, Sanders put aside their bitter campaign for the Democratic nomination and said she would take up the fight to ease economic inequality, make college more affordable and expand healthcare coverage for all Americans. This campaign is about the needs of the American people and addressing the very serious crises that we face, and there is no doubt in my mind that, as we head into November, Hillary Clinton is far and away the best candidate to do that, he told a raucous crowd in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, that included plenty of vocal Sanders supporters. I intend to do everything I can to make certain she will be the next president of the United States, the U.S. senator from Vermont said. His endorsement, five weeks after Clinton became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, brought the most prominent holdout in the partys liberal wing into her camp. Sanders threw Clinton his support less than two weeks before the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, where she is to be formally nominated. I cant help but reflect on how much more enjoyable this election will be now that we are on the same side, Clinton said of Sanders. Thank you, Bernie, for your endorsement, but more than that, thank you for your lifetime of fighting injustice. Trump ridiculed the move in a series of Twitter posts, saying Sanders had abandoned the supporters who flocked to his insurgent campaign to rein in Wall Street and get big money out of politics. Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs, Trump said on Twitter.  In a statement, the Trump campaign said Sanders was now officially part of the rigged system the senator had criticized during his long primary battle with Clinton. Bernies endorsement becomes Exhibit A in our rigged system - the Democrat Party is disenfranchising its voters to benefit the select and privileged few, said Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser to Trump. In a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday, Clinton extended her lead over Trump to 13 percentage points, up from 10 points at the end of last week. The former U.S. secretary of state hopes the Portsmouth appearance with Sanders will help her win over his supporters, some of whom held Sanders signs at the rally and chanted his name. In recent Reuters/Ipsos polling, only about 40 percent of Sanders backers said they would back Clinton, and the crowd at Tuesdays rally made it clear she still had work to do. I am absolutely certain I will not vote for Hillary Clinton, said Gale Bailey, a Sanders supporter and an unemployed graphic designer from Rochester, New Hampshire, who attended the rally in a Sanders T-shirt. Shes a crook, and Im not going to vote for a crook, Bailey said, adding that she would write in Sanders name on the November ballot. The joint appearance concluded weeks of negotiations between the two camps as Sanders pressed for concessions from Clinton on his liberal policy agenda. It came after Clinton last week adopted elements of Sanders plans for free in-state college tuition and expanded affordable healthcare coverage. Sanders also successfully pushed to include an array of liberal policy positions in the Democratic platform, which a committee approved on Saturday. Sanders did not win all of his policy fights, most notably failing to win support for blocking a congressional vote on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. But he told the Portsmouth rally that our job now is to see that platform implemented by a Democratically controlled Senate, a Democratically controlled House and a Hillary Clinton presidency  and I am going to do everything I can to make that happen. In an email to supporters after the rally, Sanders said he would still push for changes to the partys nominating process to make it more inclusive. In the months ahead, he will campaign around the country for progressive congressional candidates, he said. Also on Tuesday, a source with knowledge of the process said the Clinton campaign is vetting James Stavridis, a retired four-star Navy admiral, as a potential vice presidential running mate. Stavridis, who served as supreme allied commander at NATO, is currently dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.  Top Democrats, including President Barack Obama and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a favorite of the partys liberal wing, have already announced their support for Clinton, leaving Sanders at risk of being left behind in the Democratic battle against Trump. I think all signs point to the fact that were going to have a very united party going into Philadelphia, Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said on CNN earlier on Tuesday, and when you compare it to the Republicans, were going to be miles ahead of them.  Trump has struggled to unify the Republican Party after alienating many establishment figures with his stances on immigration, Muslims and women. A number of prominent Republicans are skipping the partys convention in Cleveland next week. ",politicsNews,"July 12, 2016 ",1
"U.S. Congress shrugs off guns, Zika as summer break nears","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress is headed for a seven-week recess without addressing gun violence, the Zika virus outbreak and other pressing issues, amid persistent election-year bickering. Despite recent gun violence, the House of Representatives will not vote this week on a proposal to keep firearms out of the hands of people on terrorism watch lists, that chambers Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters on Tuesday. Similarly, President Barack Obamas request for $1.9 billion in funds to combat the Zika virus and the birth defects it can cause has been stalled in Congress since February. Republicans and Democrats were also at odds over spending bills to keep the government functioning beyond Sept. 30, when current fiscal year funding expires. When Republicans took control of Congress, they vowed to get things done but have had difficulty doing so during this election year, failing to pass a budget or even consider Obamas nomination of Merrick Garland to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. Congress did, however, approve bipartisan legislation helping Puerto Rico out of a crippling debt crisis and is trying to make progress on legislation to improve police relations with local communities in the aftermath of gun violence. With barely four days left before the start of an unusually long recess, a failure to vote on guns would postpone any possible action by the House until at least Sept. 6, when lawmakers return. After that, they will work only for short stints ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential and congressional elections. Mass shootings in Orlando and Dallas, and gun violence in other cities, has again propelled gun control to prominence. But the National Rifle Association and its allies in Congress so far have staved off legislation. Gun control is generally opposed by Republicans and supported by Democrats. Some Republicans have talked about a gun bill possibly moving through Congress in the fall, in the midst of the campaign season, but Democrats were skeptical. This Congress will do nothing on curbing gun violence, Representative Xavier Becerra of California, a member of the House Democratic leadership, told reporters. The two sides even disagree on whether House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi talked about a proposal to establish a special committee to study gun violence. Democrats say Pelosi raised the issue with Ryan last week. Ryans office says he has never discussed the topic with anyone. Republicans in the House and Senate have signed onto a $1.1 billion Zika funding bill. But Democrats are balking over what they see as poison pills attached to the money that would deny funds to womens healthcare provider Planned Parenthood and ease some environmental provisions. Democrats, who warn the current legislation will not pass the Senate, said on Tuesday that they offered to accept some Republican provisions. But Senate Republicans insist the bill cannot be altered.  Ryan meanwhile showcased his A Better Way agenda, flashing a glossy pamphlet at a press conference listing proposals designed to lure votes in November but do nothing this year legislatively. Republicans have also pushed for new federal probes of Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, on her use of private emails while secretary of state.

U.S. attorney general deflects lawmakers' questions on Clinton emails,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. law enforcement official, under questioning from Republicans at a congressional hearing on Tuesday, shed no new light on the Justice Departments decision not to prosecute Hillary Clinton over her handling of sensitive emails. Attorney General Loretta Lynch deflected questions about the departments inquiry into Clintons use of a private email system while she was secretary of state, an issue that has hounded her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Republicans grilled Lynch at the House of Representatives committee hearing over Justices decision not to charge Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 election. Lynch has no intention of answering ... even the most basic questions about the legal elements the government is obligated to prove in a criminal prosecution, said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican. Democratic lawmakers at the hearing largely avoided the subject, asking Lynch about gun control and policing reforms.  Lynch referred questions about the departments decision to an FBI-led investigative team that recommended not bringing charges. She said she was extremely proud of the teams work, testifying one week after the FBI closed its year-long probe. The emails case is a favorite target for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, as well as other Republican politicians. Goodlatte and Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz asked the Justice Department on Monday to investigate whether Clinton committed perjury in testimony to Congress about the emails. Other investigations continue. At least one federal judge is seeking to establish whether Clinton set up the email system to thwart laws governing the publics access to official records. Judge Emmet Sullivan of the district court in Washington, who is overseeing a lawsuit accusing the State Department of not complying with records requests by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, is considering whether to order that Clinton give testimony about the system under oath.  Clintons lawyers argued against her having to testify in court papers filed on Tuesday, saying she had no more information to provide that was not already in the public record and that the Justice Department still had her emails and computer equipment. Judge Sullivan is due to rule on whether to order the deposition after a hearing next Monday. FBI Director James Comey told a congressional hearing last week he recommended against charging Clinton because there was insufficient evidence that she acted with bad intent. He added that any of his employees who handled emails the way Clinton did could be subject to dismissal or loss of security clearance. ",politicsNews,"July 12, 2016 ",1
Former Illinois Governor Blagojevich seeks reduced prison sentence,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Former two-term Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich is seeking a drastically reduced sentence that would see him released from federal prison within a year after convictions in 2011 for corruption charges including extortion and wire fraud, according to U.S. court documents. Federal prosecutors countered, recommending in documents filed just before a midnight Tuesday deadline that Blagojevich serve out his original 14-year sentence, of which he has served more than four years. The motions come ahead of a scheduled resentencing on Aug. 9 before U.S. District Judge James Zagel after an appellate court last year vacated five of Blagojevichs 18 criminal convictions. Prosecutors declined to retry the ex-governor on the vacated convictions. Blagojevich, a Democrat, was the first Illinois governor to be removed from office and has been in federal prison in Colorado since 2012. The former governor was convicted on charges including seeking money in exchange for an appointment to the senate seat formerly held by President Barack Obama. His attorneys argued in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois that the flamboyant former U.S. House Representative has made efforts toward restitution, tutoring fellow prison inmates and playing in a band with a since-released inmate called the Jailhouse Rockers. They said that Blagojevichs release from prison early would allow him to repair his relationship with his wife and two daughters. A sentence in the neighborhood of five years incarceration accompanied by a period of supervised release would be sufficient, Blagojevich attorney Leonard Goodman said in a filing. U.S. prosecutors argued that Blagojevich should serve out the entire sentence as he still does not take responsibility for his illegal actions. (Blagojevichs) continued insistence that he lacked intent to commit the crimes of which he was convicted further demonstrates a complete lack of acceptance, they said.

"For Chinese officials, Trump perhaps better the devil they don't know","BEIJING (Reuters) - In 2010, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton provoked outrage in Beijing when she pushed the South China Sea to the top of the regional and U.S. security agendas. Now as an international court prepares to hand down a ruling that threatens Chinas sweeping claims in the vital waterway, Beijing is watching Clintons presidential run with trepidation.  Combined with her tough line on human rights and role in leading President Barack Obamas Asia rebalancing, Clinton is well-known in China - but not well liked.  While presidential rival Donald Trump has irritated Beijing with comments such as comparing the U.S. trade deficit with China to rape, he is largely an unknown quantity, a person who even privately officials shrug their shoulders over. Clinton will be a difficult partner, one senior Chinese diplomatic source told Reuters, having just admitted to not knowing much about Trump or what he stands for.   Chinese diplomats take some comfort that Clintons views are known to them from years of high-level contacts, from her days as first lady to her Senate tenure to her time as secretary of state. But they are also mindful that even while seeking diplomatic accommodations, she has been a staunch critic of Beijing on a range of issues, including the South China Sea, trade and human rights. China remembers clearly a 2010 Southeast Asian security summit in Hanoi, when Clinton waded into the South China Sea dispute, saying open access and legal solutions were a U.S. national interest and pivotal to regional security. In a strongly worded response, China stressed the South China Sea as one of its core interests, putting the issue up there with Taiwan, Tibet and Xinjiang in terms of its importance to Beijing. China warned its rival claimants and neighbors not to be emboldened by U.S. support - a line it has repeated ever since. An arbitration court hearing the dispute between China and the Philippines over the South China Sea is set to hand down its ruling on in the Dutch city of The Hague on Tuesday. Legal experts expect at least some substantive findings to go against China, which has vowed to ignore the ruling. Chinas military, which is ramping up its presence in the South China Sea as part of a major modernization program, is also watching the election closely.          Hillary is very fierce when it comes to China, a Chinese official close to the military establishment told Reuters. While the Chinese government has been largely quiet about the U.S. election, state media has not been so restrained, with one paper even equating Trump to Hitler.  In May, Chinas official Xinhua news agency noted Trumps more isolationist campaign compared to Clintons, who it described as an old foreign policy hand and important backer of the Asia-Pacific pivot that China considers a threat. As far as shes concerned, being tough on foreign policy is perhaps the best way to show Americas so called leadership, it said in a commentary. Laura Rosenberger, a Clinton campaign foreign policy adviser who worked with her in the State Department, told Reuters Clinton would remain tough on the South China Sea issue. She believes that we need to be very strong in terms of standing up to many of the actions the Chinese have taken, Rosenberger said. She believes in the principles of freedom of navigation in international waters, that commerce on the high seas in incredibly important to the United States, and that these are really very direct interests that we need to continue to stand up for. Trump adviser Peter Navarro, an economist at University of California Irvine and the author of the book, Crouching Tiger: What Chinas Militarism Means for the World, said a Trump presidency would lead to respect. The central difference between a Trump administration and the current administration or a Clinton administration is respect. The leaders of Russia, the leaders of China will respect Mr. Trump, will respect America because we will be strong economically, militarily and politically. Trump may actually find some sympathy in China, even if he is seen as an unknown quantity.  Who is Trump? We dont really know. We do know he hates Muslims though - and that will be well received in some circles here, said the Chinese official with ties to the military, pointing to what China views as its war on terror in its Muslim-populated far western region of Xinjiang. China also views Trump as a businessmen with whom they can probably negotiate. It would be very transactional for the Chinese, said a senior Western diplomat in Beijing. Hes a businessman they think theyll be able to strike a deal with. Trump may also be less tough on China over human rights than Clinton, who has frequently clashed with Beijing on the issue.  In 2011, Clinton said China was on a fools errand to try to halt the march of freedom, while in 2012 she was deeply involved in efforts to get blind dissident Chen Guangcheng out of China after he fled to the U.S. embassy in Beijing.  Trump advisor Navarro said Clintons record on human rights abuse was sketchy at best and abysmal at worst, highlighting her first trip to Asia as Secretary of State in 2009, where other issues were given priority. So its difficult to see how she would have someone would view her as credible on that issue.  Rosenberger, the Clinton adviser, rejected that view, highlighting comments from Trump in a 1990 interview referring to the strength of the Chinese government in its bloody crackdown of student-led protests in Tiananmen Square a year earlier. Its ironic for Trumps adviser to criticize Hillarys statement there when Trump himself has actually praised the Chinese for the Tiananmen massacre, Rosenberger said.  Still, China is hoping that whoever wins they will understand that both countries need each other and will have to work closely, a source with ties to the Chinese leadership told Reuters, requesting anonymity. It is the most important bilateral relationship in the world. China needs the United States and vice versa, the source said. We dont know who will be the lesser of two evils.

House chairmen seek new federal probe of Clinton testimony,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican chairmen of two U.S. House of Representatives committees asked the Justice Department on Monday to launch an investigation into whether Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton committed perjury during testimony to Congress about her use of a private email server. The evidence collected by the FBI during its investigation of Secretary Clintons use of a personal email system appears to directly contradict several aspects of her sworn testimony to Congress, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said in a letter to U.S. Attorney Channing Phillips requesting the probe. After a year-long investigation of Clintons emails, the FBI recommended that no criminal charges be brought against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election. That recommendation was accepted by Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The FBI found, however, that she was extremely careless while secretary of state in her handling of email documents that contained classified information. Representative Elijah Cummings, the senior Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform panel, accused Republicans of a political vendetta following years of Republican-led investigations of Clinton in the House. Republicans are now squandering even more taxpayer dollars in a desperate attempt to keep this issue alive and bring down Secretary Clintons poll numbers ahead of the election, Cummings said. Clinton has said that she did not believe she was handling classified information on the private email system. Chaffetz has also asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation  to give him access to its investigative files on Clinton. ",politicsNews,"July 11, 2016 ",1
Prospects for House vote on gun control measure dims,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Prospects dimmed on Monday for the U.S. House of Representatives to vote this week on Republican legislation to restrict gun sales to suspected extremists before Congress goes on a seven-week summer break.  Republicans including House Speaker Paul Ryan have been under pressure to act on gun legislation since the June 12 mass shootings at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Congress begins a summer recess on Friday. But with the House floor schedule filling with other bills, Republicans said gun legislation was unlikely to come up before September, when prospects for serious action could be overshadowed by the fall presidential election campaign.   Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, who heads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said, I do not anticipate that bill. The measure, backed by the National Rifle Association, would give government authorities three days to convince a judge to block the sale of weapons to someone suspected of involvement in violent extremism. But Ryan has been unable to win support from conservative Republicans who say the measure poses potential constitutional problems and should be subjected to regular legislative channels including formal hearings. Republican lawmakers say discussions aimed at finding compromise are continuing. But the measure did not come up at a Monday meeting with Republican leaders to discuss the weeks agenda, said another lawmaker who predicted it would not see a vote this week.   The stalemate leaves hanging Democratic demands for stronger gun restrictions, despite an unprecedented 25-hour sit-in by House Democrats last month, and sidelines any potential movement on an alternative bipartisan bill seen as a possible compromise. A vote is going to be stalled until Congress returns from its long summer break, one Republican aide said. Lawmakers initially believed Congress could pass some kind of measure before their summer recess after the Orlando shootings raised national security concerns and polls showed a majority of Americans in favor of greater restrictions.

U.S. House approves bill to upgrade airport security,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House of Representatives on Monday approved an aviation bill that would upgrade security at U.S. airports in the aftermath of the Brussels and Istanbul attacks while extending funds for the Federal Aviation Administration for another 14 months. The approval, by a simple voice vote, sends the legislation to the Senate, where lawmakers were expected to approve the measure and forward it to the White House for President Barack Obamas signature before Congress leaves for a seven-week summer break on Friday. The measure includes provisions from an earlier Senate bill that require tougher vetting of aviation workers with access to secure airport areas, expedited security checks to move passengers more quickly from airport areas that are not secured and a larger number of police dogs for security duty in the U.S. transportation system. It extends the current level of federal funding for FAA programs through September 2017. Congress has been struggling to find agreement on a more comprehensive package to reauthorize the U.S. aviation regulatory agency. A measure that would have provided FAA funding over six years stalled in the House earlier this year, amid disagreement over a proposal to privatize the U.S. air traffic control system. House Republicans say they intend to use the time between now and September 2017 to find ways to move the privatization plan forward.  ",politicsNews,"July 12, 2016 ",1
Obama renews call for U.S. public health insurance option,"(Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Monday urged Congress to reconsider offering a government-run health insurance option alongside private plans on the exchanges created as part of his national healthcare law.  In an article published in the online edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association, Obama said the Affordable Care Act had made much progress toward improving access to healthcare and the quality and affordability of care.  Many Republicans fiercely oppose the law saying it has raised health coverage costs for Americans and have tried repeatedly to repeal it in Congress    Obama said several challenges remain.  Now, based on experience with the ACA, I think Congress should revisit a public plan to compete alongside private insurers in areas of the country where competition is limited, the president wrote.     Public programs like Medicare often deliver care more cost effectively by curtailing administrative overhead and securing better prices from providers, Obama said. Republicans and some Democrats opposed the inclusion of a government-run plan similar to Medicare in the original Obamacare law, and the so-called public option did not make it into the final legislation.   Since the ACA became law, the uninsured rate has declined  to 9.1 percent in 2015 from 16 percent in 2010. Most enrollees live in counties with at least three policy issuers, which helps keep down costs, Obama said. However, 12 percent of those enrolled in plans through the exchanges live in areas with only one or two issuers. Adding a public plan in such areas would give consumers more affordable options, he said. Obama also called on Congress to increase financial assistance to purchase coverage, which he said would help middle class families who are stilling struggling with premiums. Obama said spending on prescription drugs, which rose 12 percent in 2014, remains a problem, and he urged Congress to act on his proposal to increase transparency around manufacturers production and development costs. He said the federal government should be given the authority to negotiate prices for certain high-priced drugs. Last month, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives unveiled a plan to overhaul the nations healthcare system that would keep some of Obamacares more popular provisions, including protections for people with pre-existing conditions and allowing young adults to stay on their parents coverage until age 26. The proposal, which is not formal legislation, is part of a broader effort by House Speaker Paul Ryan to offer a Republican agenda ahead of the Nov. 8 elections.  ",politicsNews,"July 11, 2016 ",1
"A year later, U.S. lawmakers still take aim at Iran nuclear deal","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers this week will consider three Republican-backed measures targeting the Obama administrations nuclear agreement with Iran, which bitterly divides Washington a year after it was announced and could play a role in Novembers elections. One bill would impose new sanctions on Iran over any sponsorship of terrorism or human rights violations. Another would bar the purchase from Iran of heavy water, a non-radioactive byproduct from making nuclear weapons and nuclear energy. The third would block Irans access to the U.S. financial system, including the use of the dollar. Republican lawmakers, who control the House of Representatives and Senate and unanimously opposed the nuclear deal announced last July 14, have said the measures are necessary to send Iran a strong message that it will face consequences if it violates international agreements. Many, joined by several Democrats, have been especially concerned by Irans actions since the deal was officially implemented in January, including its test-firing of ballistic missiles in March. It makes sense to do all we can to check this very dangerous Iranian activity, Republican Representative Ed Royce, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told the Rules Committee, which sets up rules for debate of bills headed to the House floor. Thanks in part to the nuclear agreement, Iran has begun to rejoin global politics and economics after more than three decades of isolation. Business and political leaders are visiting the country, which is also hosting trade conferences. In his first report on the deal, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Irans ballistic missile launches are not consistent with the constructive spirit of the nuclear deal. He said it was up to the U.N. Security Council to decide if the launches violated the resolution backing the agreement. However, he also said he was encouraged by Irans implementation of its nuclear commitments. Republicans worry that President Barack Obama is so eager to preserve the pact as a legacy that his administration will give Tehran too much leeway before he leaves office in January. ELECTION-YEAR POLITICS? Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, backs the nuclear deal. Republican candidate Donald Trump has promised to tear it up if he is elected on Nov. 8. Most of Obamas fellow Democrats in Congress backed the agreement. They say the new legislation is intended to undermine or even derail it. The White House issued a threat on Monday to veto all three bills, saying they would affect the continued viability of the nuclear agreement. The deal is critical to ensuring that Irans nuclear program is and will remain exclusively peaceful, which is profoundly in the national security interest of the United States and the international community, it said in a statement. The bills are not expected to win enough votes to advance in the Senate, even if they pass the House. And if they did pass the Senate, they would lack enough support to override a veto. Backers of the Iran deal said Republicans were trying to appeal to voters just days before the convention where Trump is due to become the partys presidential nominee. Polls show an overwhelming majority of Americans have an unfavorable view of Iran. Dylan Williams, vice president for government affairs at J Street, a pro-Israel group that supported the nuclear deal, said such legislation plays into voters frustration with what they see as a do-nothing Congress. This kind of grandstanding not only endangers our security by endangering the deal, its exactly the type of politics that people are sick of, he said. ",politicsNews,"July 11, 2016 ",1
"Trump and Christie join forces to attack Obama, Clinton","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans Donald Trump and Chris Christie teamed up on Monday to assail Democratic President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton as weak on domestic security, making the kind of one-two punch possible if Trump picks Christie as his running mate. At a rally in Virginia Beach, Virginia, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, and Christie, the tough-talking New Jersey governor, seized on the Dallas police shootings as examples of why Americans need a law and order candidate like Trump. Much of the debate about security in the presidential campaign has been about threats abroad. The shooting deaths of five Dallas police officers last week and violence in other cities have shifted the debate back home for now. Trump, a wealthy real estate developer, presented himself as the law and order candidate and called Clinton weak. He said she has grown out of touch with the plight of ordinary Americans and cited her making paid speeches to corporate interests as a cause. Perhaps it is easy for politicians to lose touch with reality when they are being paid millions of dollars to read speeches to Wall Street executives, instead of spending time with real people in real pain, he said. The disconnect in America is deep. There are two Americas: the ruling class, and the groups it favors, and then everyone else, said Trump. In the final days of his search for a vice presidential running mate, Trump was introduced at the event by Christie, who is one of Trumps top potential picks to be his vice presidential running mate. Christie, a former rival of Trump for the presidential nomination, showed himself capable of assuming the role of political attack dog, a job the vice presidential nominee usually assumes. He suggested Obama has taken sides against police in the countrys debate over race and police brutality. We need a president who once again will put law and order at the top of the priority of the presidency of this country, Christie said. Our police officers ... need to understand that the president of the United States and his administration will give them the benefit of the doubt, not always believe that what they have done is somehow wrong. Trump has been test-driving his vice presidential possibilities. He campaigned last week with former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, and is to appear with a third No. 2 possibility, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, in Indiana on Tuesday. The New York businessman has appeared most comfortable publicly with Gingrich. Both Gingrich and Christie have been advisers for Trump behind the scenes. Trump is also considering retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn for the job, but told The Washington Post in an interview published on Monday that he is leaning toward a conventional politician. I dont need two anti-establishment people, Trump said. Someone respected by the establishment and liked by the establishment would be good for unification. I do like unification of the Republican Party. Trump said he would decide on his vice presidential pick in the next three or four days. The Republican National Convention, at which he is to be nominated as the partys candidate, opens in Cleveland next Monday.

"Sanders could endorse Clinton's White House bid, but some divisions linger","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders is set to throw his support behind fellow Democrat Hillary Clintons bid for the White House on Tuesday, a boost for the former secretary of state as she prepares to face off with Republican rival Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election. An endorsement from Sanders would end a bitterly fought battle for the Democratic nomination that split the party over education, healthcare and climate change, and comes after Clinton offered Sanders a handful of policy concessions on those issues in recent weeks. At a rally in New Hampshire on Tuesday, the pair will appear together to discuss a shared commitment to building an America that is stronger together and an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, according to statements released Monday by both campaigns.  Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver would not confirm whether Sanders would formally endorse Clinton on Tuesday but said the rally will be the first of many in which Sanders will be out there stumping for the Democratic nominee. Sanders had been under pressure for weeks from Democratic Party officials to throw his weight behind Clinton after she locked up the required number of delegates last month with a string of wins in state-by-state primary contests, but had resisted, citing policy differences. Clinton needs Sanders supporters to boost her chances against Trump in her run for the White House. Only about 40 percent of Sanders supporters say they would vote for her, according to recent Reuters/Ipsos polling.  Weaver said that despite Sanders backing of Clinton, he would likely still press on with his efforts to reform the Democratic Party nominating process after a contentious primary season, pushing to open primaries to independent voters and change the roles of superdelegates, party stalwarts who can support a nominee of their choosing regardless of how people voted in their districts. In the past few weeks, both camps have been in regular contact on how to bring Clinton closer to some of Sanders progressive stances on issues like wealth inequality, trade, healthcare, education, and the environment in an effort to unify the party. But some Sanders supporters are not fully satisfied by Clintons concessions on the party platform - most of which centered on education and healthcare - suggesting there may be some room for friction at the Democratic National Convention later this month where Clinton is set to be formally nominated. This is a platform clearly influenced by Bernie Sanders, said James Zogby, the president of the Arab American Institute and a Sanders appointee to the partys platform drafting committee.      But, he added, there were several areas where the Clinton campaign lost an opportunity to not only reach out to the Sanders base but to also to make a dramatic statement to the American people in general that would have gone a long way in helping her demonstrate that she will be a different kind of candidate, he said.  For example, he said, the party could have used stronger language in its policy platform draft to condemn the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which Sanders has argued would hurt American workers and which Clinton has also vocally opposed. Sanders challenge to Clinton, one of the best-known figures in U.S. politics, lasted far longer than expected, running for four months and across 50 states and yielding record numbers of small donations to his campaign.  He has previously vowed to help Clinton defeat Trump but has been reluctant to end his campaign, and has come short of making a formal endorsement even as other prominent Democrats have rallied around her, including President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a favorite of the partys liberal wing. On Monday, the Communications Workers of America endorsed Clinton, after having earlier endorsed Sanders.  ",politicsNews,"July 11, 2016 ",1
Race for U.S. Senate seat in Indiana shaken up by Hill withdrawal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Baron Hill on Monday announced he was leaving the race for an open U.S. Senate seat in Indiana, clearing the way for a potentially more popular, better-funded Democratic candidate and possibly helping the partys prospects in Novembers elections. After consulting with my family, my staff and party leaders, I am withdrawing from the U.S. Senate race and removing my name from the November ballot, Hill, a former Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives said in a Facebook post. Media organizations reported that former U.S. Senator Evan Bayh, who also has served as Indianas governor, would replace Hill on the Democratic ballot in the Nov. 8 election. Bayh was not immediately available for comment, but if he enters the race, he would challenge Representative Todd Young, the Republican nominee. In announcing his decision, Hill noted that Democrats have a good chance of winning majority control of the Senate, especially with a strong nominee who has the money, name identification and resources to win. I do not want to stand in the way of Democrats winning Indiana and the U.S. Senate. Bayh, who served two terms in the Senate before retiring in 2010, has nearly $10 million in cash on hand, according to the latest Federal Election Commission filings.  According to the FEC, Hill had less than $400,000 cash on hand. ",politicsNews,"July 11, 2016 ",1
Obama must make new budget request for Iraq troops: Thornberry,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee said on Monday that President Barack Obama must ask Congress for additional funds to pay the deployment of more troops to Iraq, as Congress and the White House debate defense spending amid mandatory budget cuts. Added to the Presidents Afghanistan announcement last week, the United States will now be deploying thousands more troops than we have budgeted for in the Presidents budget request, Representative Mac Thornberry said in a statement. Those deployments can only be fully supported through a supplemental budget request, Thornberry said. U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced on Monday that Washington would send 560 additional troops to assist Iraqi forces in an expected push on the Islamic State stronghold of Mosul. Obama said on July 6 he would keeping 8,400 troops in Afghanistan through the end of his presidency in January. As the Republican-led Congress and the Democratic administration grapple over spending, Obama has threatened to veto a $602 billion defense policy bill because of its use of special funds for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to avoid mandatory spending limits. Democrats say the Department of Defense should be subject to the same spending restrictions as non-military programs, but Republicans accuse Democrats of stinting on national security in order to fund pet projects.

Clinton's conundrum: caught between protesters and police,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The shocking shooting deaths of five Dallas police officers have magnified the challenge that Hillary Clinton faces as she tries to reassure both voters jittery about social unrest and activists angry about law-enforcement abuses that she is on their side. For Clinton, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, the political concerns going forward are two-fold. She cant afford to alienate black and progressive voters she needs to show up in large numbers in the November election by taking too strong a stand against the protests like those recently in Louisiana and Minnesota that resulted in hundreds of arrests.  At the same time, Clinton cant allow more moderate voters worried about the violent images on their TV screens to gravitate to her Republican rival, Donald Trump, who has attempted to use the tragedy in Dallas to argue that he is the better law-and-order candidate.  Clinton herself recognizes the fine line she is trying to navigate. In remarks Friday following the Dallas sniper attack that left five officers dead, she acknowledged she was sending a mixed message in advocating for reform to curb police misconduct while at the same time praising the honor and bravery of police officers. I know that, just by saying all these things together, I may upset some people, Clinton said in Philadelphia. Polling by Reuters/Ipsos has revealed sharp differences in how Trump and Clintons supporters view the police when it comes to African-American suspects. Just 24 percent of Trump voters believe that black people are treated worse than whites compared to 55 percent of Clinton voters, according to a poll conducted between May 13 and June 7.  African-Americans were also almost twice as likely as whites to describe the police as too violent, according to Reuters polling. The slain Dallas gunman, Micah Johnson, shot a dozen Dallas officers because he wanted to kill white people, authorities said. Prior to the attack, Clinton had tried to demonstrate her solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement after black men were killed by police in a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. White people need to start listening, she said, to the legitimate cries that are coming from our African-American fellow citizens. Clintons words were seized upon on Sunday by retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, a top contender to be Trumps vice-presidential pick. Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, called Clintons comments irresponsible in an interview with ABC News because she talked about white people being to blame. Trump argued on Twitter Sunday that the United States is a divided nation due in part to the leadership of Clinton and President Barack Obama. Reports had him now strongly considering Flynn as a running mate in part because of Americans growing concerns over public safety.  But Clinton has also had problems with black activists. Two Black Lives Matter advocates crashed a fundraiser in February, complaining about Clintons past comments about youth gangs. And in April, protesters sparred with her husband Bill Clinton, the former president, over the 1994 bill he signed into law that put non-violent offenders in prison for longer terms. Clinton has spoken at length about criminal-justice reform and scaling back gun rights, but still is viewed by many progressives, who have increasing sway in the party, as too centrist. Democrats, for example, are expected to formally call for the abolition of the death penalty for the first time at the partys nominating convention later this month.  While Clinton has been critical about racial bias in the application of capital punishment, she has come short of saying it should be done away with. Trump has argued the death penalty should be automatic for anyone found guilty of murdering a police officer. Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist in Florida, said he believes Clinton can find a message that can appease both moderates and liberals on the issue of police violence.  She can talk to the types of voters who strongly support their local law enforcement, but who also understand there are very troubling stories coming out of certain communities and real issues that need to be addressed, he said.  Clinton may be able to utilize Vice President Joe Biden, well-liked by law enforcement, as a surrogate to reach out to police groups. Clinton and Biden were scheduled to campaign together Friday, but the event was canceled in the wake of the Dallas incident.  However, Biden, as a U.S. senator, was an advocate of the 1994 crime bill thats now the object of scorn among black activists, underscoring the thorny politics of the issue within the party.  Trump continues to enjoy the same kind of advantage among white voters that Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, held. The most recent Reuters tracking poll shows Trump leading Clinton among white likely voters by two points, while Trump trails Clinton among all likely voters by 13 points.  That makes African-American turnout particularly critical for Clinton. In 2012, Romney won almost 60 percent of the white vote but still lost handily to Obama, who drove minorities to the polls in high numbers.  ",politicsNews,"July 11, 2016 ",1

Possible Trump VP pick says he supports abortion rights,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, under consideration by Republican Donald Trump as a possible vice presidential choice, said on Sunday he favors a womans right to choose whether to have an abortion. That stance places Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, at odds with the official Republican Party position, which is firmly anti-abortion. Asked about his position on abortion on ABC News This Week, Flynn, a registered Democrat, said women have to be able to choose and that women have to make the decision because theyre the ... ones that are going to decide to bring up that child or not.  Trump, the presumptive Republican White House nominee, has said he will pick his vice president before the partys nomination convention opens on July 18. Flynn has been an adviser to the Trump campaign since early this year.  The Washington Post reported on Saturday that Trump is becoming increasingly infatuated with Flynn, who ran the Defense Intelligence Agency from 2012-2014 under President Barack Obama, because he believes national unrest and the threat of terrorism may demand a tough and steady presence on the ticket.  As a businessman and real-estate developer, Trump also likes the idea of teaming up with another non-politician, the Post reported. For weeks Trump has conducted a high-profile canvassing of Republican political stalwarts as part of his running mate search, but he has also made clear he is looking at what a military leader would bring to the ticket. A source familiar with the matter confirmed to Reuters on Saturday that Flynn had emerged as a possibility. According to the source, Flynn is seen as someone who would be able to help Trump in the area of national security at a time of challenges abroad like the threat from Islamic State militants. Trump is also considering more conventional vice presidential contenders, such as former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, Indiana Governor Mike Pence or New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

Obama says attacks on police hurt Black Lives Matter cause,"MADRID (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama has warned that attacks on police over racial bias would hurt the anti-racism Black Lives Matter movement, days after a sniper killed five police officers in Dallas in apparent revenge for police shootings of black people.  Obama said although most activists from the Black Lives Matter movement wanted to see better relations between communities and law enforcement, violence and overly broad criticism against police undermined the protest movement. I want to say to say to everyone concerned about ... racial bias in the criminal justice system that maintaining a truthful, serious and respectful tone is going to help mobilize American society to bring about real change, Obama said. Whenever those of us who are concerned about failures of the criminal justice system attack police, you are doing a disservice to the cause, he told a news conference in Madrid where he is on a one-day visit.  Micah Johnson, a black U.S. military veteran of the Afghan war, opened fire on police officers on Thursday during a protest in Dallas against the fatal shootings of two black men by police in Louisiana and Minnesota the previous day. Johnson wanted to kill white people, especially white officers, Dallas Police Chief David Brown said after the attack on Thursday night. The Black Lives Matter group said on Friday it advocated dignity, not murder, in response to the shooting that also left seven other police officers and two civilians wounded. Obama said there was legitimate criticism to be made of the criminal justice system and that citizens should continue to protest against it. I would hope that police organizations are also respectful of the frustrations that people in these communities feel and not just dismiss these protests as political correctness or politics or attacks on police, he said.

Trump looks at retired general Flynn as possible running mate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is giving consideration to retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as a potential vice presidential running mate, a Republican source familiar with the process said on Saturday. For weeks Trump has conducted a high-profile canvassing of Republican political stalwarts as part of his running mate search, but he has also made clear he is looking at what a military leader would bring to the ticket. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Flynn has emerged as a possibility, confirming reports in the New York Post and The Washington Post. The Trump campaign had no comment. The thinking is that Flynn, who has been a foreign policy adviser to Trump, would be able to help Trump in the area of national security at a time of challenges abroad like the threat from Islamic State militants. Trump is also considering a more conventional political choice for his running mate, such as former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, Indiana Governor Mike Pence or New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Flynn was chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama from 2012-2014. He has spoken in the past about wanting the United States to work more closely with Russia to resolve global security issues. Flynn told Russia Today in an interview published on Dec. 10 that the United States and Russia should work together to resolve the Syrian civil war and defeat Islamic State. Flynn has a book coming out next week, co-written with Michael Ledeen, titled: The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies. ",politicsNews,"July 9, 2016 ",1
Sanders' TPP stance shot down by Democrats' platform committee,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A trade deal fight led by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Saturday failed to fully materialize as rival and presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton announced a compromise to expand mandatory healthcare funding over the next decade. At a meeting of the Democratic Party draft platform committee in Orlando, Florida, on Saturday, supporters of Sanders were unable to influence the committee to adopt strong language opposing the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact, marking a powerful blow to the efforts by the U.S. senator from Vermont to push the party further to the left. We did everything we could to win that vote, said Sanders policy adviser Warren Gunnels. It was very disappointing. Instead of a condemnation specific to the TPP, the committee reached language saying they would oppose trade agreements that do not support good American jobs. Sanders has headed the effort on the U.S. left to oppose the TPP and trade deals like it, which he says are unfair to American workers. Clinton has also come out as opposed to the agreement.  Despite Clinton having already secured the requisite delegates to clinch the partys nomination at the July 25-28 convention, Sanders remains in the race to be the partys nominee.  He has indicated that he would hold off on endorsing Clinton for the Nov. 8 general election fight against Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump until she adopted policies and campaign language that more closely resembled his own more liberal tone. I would like to say that while this vote was disappointing, we have won some tremendous victories, Gunnels said, including securing language in the draft supporting a federal $15 minimum wage, another trademark issue for Sanders. On the same day, the Clinton campaign announced changes to its healthcare policy proposal, including increasing mandatory healthcare funding under the Affordable Care Act by $40 billion over the next 10 years, highlighting the significant influence Sanders still yields over the party.  We have more work to do to finish our long fight to provide universal, quality, affordable healthcare to everyone in America, Clinton said in a statement that included her intention to give Americans the choice of a public-option insurance plan and allow for individuals below Medicare age, beginning at 55, to opt in to the U.S. federal program that pays elderly Americans hospital bills. Sanders has made combating healthcare costs a rallying cry of his campaign and often battled with Clinton during the primary race on how best to reach their shared goal of universal healthcare. On Saturday, Sanders praised the updates to Clintons proposal as a step in the right direction to save lives and ease suffering, indicating, along with the more liberal tone in several parts of the 2016 platform draft, a growing compromise between the two camps. For Clinton, an endorsement from Sanders - seen as a champion of the progressive left - could open the door to many of his supporters who have been reluctant to support the more moderate Clinton. The proposal brought forth today by Secretary Clinton, working with our campaign, is an important step forward in expanding healthcare in America - and expanding health insurance and healthcare access to tens of millions of Americans, he said in a statement. I congratulate Secretary Clinton for this extremely important initiative. The New York Times reported on Thursday that an endorsement is imminent, and Sanders is expected to officially throw his support behind Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, at a campaign stop in New Hampshire early next week.

"U.S. gun rules heighten tension between police, citizens: Obama","WARSAW (Reuters) - President Barack Obama pledged on Saturday to seek ways to calm racial tensions and reduce divisions between police and minorities during his final months in office, but he warned that easy access to guns nationwide exacerbated the problem. Obama spoke at the end of a week in which five policemen were killed by a sniper in Dallas and two black men were killed by police in Minnesota and Louisiana. He said he would bring together civil rights and law enforcement leaders for talks at the White House next week after returning from a trip to Europe. Obama, the first black U.S. president, has spoken out on racial issues throughout his time in the White House. He has also tried but failed to reform American gun laws, stymied by Republicans in Congress who have opposed any measures that they seen as impinging on the Constitutional right to bear arms, despite a series of mass shootings in recent years. Obama said the Dallas police force reduced murder rates and community complaints by taking the issue of race and police conduct seriously, and said he hoped that would inspire constructive actions in the coming weeks. Thats the spirit that we all need to embrace. Thats the spirit that I want to build on, he said during a press conference in Poland. But the divisive issue of gun control could not be separated from the tension between police and local citizens, he said.   Obama noted that Dallas police on Thursday had to protect themselves and citizens from sniper fire while deciphering who had guns among those taking part in a protest decrying police shootings of black men. The presence of a gun in the car where Philando Castile, 32, was killed by police in Minnesota on Wednesday contributed to that event, he said. In Minneapolis, we dont know yet what happened, but we do know that there was a gun in the car that apparently was licensed, but it caused, in some fashion, those tragic events, Obama told reporters.  We cant just ignore that and pretend that thats somehow political ... it is a contributing factor  not the sole factor  but a contributing factor to the broader tensions that arise between police and the communities where they serve. Obama is very unlikely to succeed in reviving major gun control reform before he leaves office in January. Lawmakers in Congress have fought over three rival gun measures since the June 12 mass shootings at a gay nightclub in Orlando. Democrats promised to put pressure on Republicans next week to win votes for measures to expand background checks and allow the Justice Department to block gun sales to people on government watch lists. Obama said on Saturday he hoped his legacy on the issue of race would be one of urging Americans to listen to each other and understand the countrys difficult relationship with race. The legacy of slavery and Jim Crow and discrimination didnt suddenly vanish with the passage of the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act or the election of Barack Obama, he said. He said he hoped his words as president had conveyed that things have gotten better, substantially better, but that weve still got a lot more work to do. ",politicsNews,"July 9, 2016 ",1
Obama 'concerned' about U.S. State Department handling of classified information,"WARSAW (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Saturday he was concerned about how the State Department handles classified information but cast this as part of a government-wide challenge in the age of email, texts and smartphones. FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday recommended against prosecuting Hillary Clinton or her aides for their extremely careless handling of classified information on the private email server that she used as secretary of state. Comey said the FBI had found evidence that the security culture of the State Department in general, and with respect to use of unclassified systems in particular, was generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information thats found elsewhere in the U.S. government. Asked about the FBI directors assessment, Obama told reporters in a news conference: I am concerned. The advent of email and texts and smart phones is just generating enormous amounts of data, Obama added, saying that this, in turn was putting enormous pressure on the department to sort through it, classify it properly. Obama said that if one classified too much, the benefits of the information evaporated because it took too long to process. It reflects a larger problem in government, he added. Clinton has said her use of a private email server was a mistake. ",politicsNews,"July 9, 2016 ",1
Republican Party chairman confident in Cleveland convention security,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Party chief Reince Priebus expressed confidence on Saturday that security will be able to handle any protests at the partys convention later this month in Cleveland, where Donald Trump is to be nominated as the Republican presidential candidate. Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, told Reuters in a telephone interview that the tragic shootings in Texas, Minnesota and Louisiana in recent days may lead to a more peaceful discourse in general across the country. Cleveland police on Friday tightened their security plan for the July 18-21 Republican National Convention in the wake of the shootings. They also increased surveillance and intelligence operations. The outpouring of grief among Americans after the bloodshed could lead to a more understanding and polite discourse and a feeling of support in communities and with police, Priebus said, and that this same feeling of understanding could also take place in Cleveland. Weve been working really hard on security. Im very confident that things are going to go very well in Cleveland. The police are there in full force to be helpful to protesters, but also to keep the event safe and free from incident, he said. Priebus, who has worked to rally Republicans behind Trump, said the convention should serve as a vehicle to unify more party loyalists behind the New York businessman whose incendiary rhetoric and policy positions have troubled some Republicans. Priebus added that the never Trump movement has ebbed and that he did not believe any rebellion among Republican delegates at the convention against Trump would succeed. Its one thing to be unhappy because your person didnt win. I get that part. But its another step to now say because I dont like the way this is going, Im going to take something away from someone who won it fair and square. Theres just not a lot of people that are willing to do that, he said. Priebus, who has privately counseled Trump, said it is important for him to continue making the case against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton after the FBI concluded she had been extremely careless in handling some sensitive emails as President Barack Obamas secretary of state. Trump, at a campaign rally in Ohio on Wednesday, had sharply criticized Clinton at the outset, but then diverted to attacking the news media for how it is covering his campaign. In a 45-minute rally, he spent a long time on Hillary and I think its OK for him to divert here and there, but I do think focusing on Hillary is important and a vision for America is important, Priebus said.

Pentagon says near deal with Lockheed for more F-35 fighter jets,"RAF FAIRFORD, England (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Defense and Lockheed Martin Corp are in the final stages of negotiations about two contracts for 160 fighter jets, tandem deals valued at more than $14 billion, the Pentagons F-35 program manager said on Saturday. Were in the end game, Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan said in an interview at the Royal International Air Tattoo the worlds largest military airshow, where six F-35 Lightning II jets are flying this week. Bogdan said an agreement could be finalised soon, but declined to predict if it could be announced at the Farnborough International Airshow next week. He said all the major issues had been resolved and the fate of the deal was largely in Lockheeds hands at the moment. Lockheeds F-35 program manager Jeff Babione had told reporters on Thursday that he expected to reach an agreement soon about contracts for the ninth and 10th production contracts for the new warplane. Sources familiar with the two contracts said they would likely be valued between $14 billion and $15 billion. Babione said the price of the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing version of the jet would drop to under $100 million per plane in the 10th low-rate production batch, including an engine built by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. Bogdan said he was continuing to work on a block buy deal for international partners on the $379 billion warplane project, the largest arms program in the world, as part of a larger effort to drive down the jets cost.  Buying larger numbers of jets at a time  starting with the 12th production batch of jets  could generate savings of $2 billion to $2.8 billion, even if the U.S. military was not able to join in until it got congressional approval, he said.  The U.S. military services would likely join in starting with the 13th and 14th production lots, which would reduce the initially anticipated savings by hundreds of millions of dollars, he said. Bogdan told reporters the program office was carefully assessing any potential impact on trade and tariffs stemming from Britains vote to leave the European Union, but the initial expectation was that it would not have much impact. A drop in the value of the British pound could help lower some costs, since 15 percent of the jet is built by UK firms.            ",politicsNews,"July 9, 2016 ",1

Clinton says she relied on State staff for classification decisions,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton disputed a scathing assessment by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that she was extremely careless with classified government secrets, saying on Friday she relied on the judgment of her subordinates at the U.S. State Department. After maintaining for more than a year that she did not send or receive classified information through her unauthorized private email system, she acknowledged in a string of interviews on Friday she may have at least unwittingly done so, three days after the FBI concluded this happened at least 110 times. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said she certainly did not believe that she was handling classified information on her email system at the time, but emphasized that she followed the lead of her subordinates on whether information was classified. I did not have a basis for second-guessing their conclusion, Clinton said in an interview with CNN, saying she had the highest regard for her former colleagues. These are experienced diplomats, they have expertise in handling classified material, she said in a separate interview with PBS Newshour. They were not careless and the material that they sent, they did not believe that was classified. Clinton, who was the departments most senior classifying authority during her four-year tenure at its helm, did not address the FBIs conclusion that she herself sent information on topics classified as top secret, the highest level, through a private server she kept in her basement.  I have said, and I repeated, that it was a mistake to use personal email and I regret that, she said in another interview with ABC. It is a crime to mishandle classified information, and while FBI Director James Comey said on Tuesday there was evidence Clinton or her aides may have broken these laws, there was not enough evidence of criminal intent for a prosecution. In an unusual 15-minute announcement explaining the FBIs findings, Comey ended up dismaying both Republicans and Democrats. While Clintons Republican opponents have fumed at the decision not to file criminal charges, Clinton and her staff have disputed some of Comeys criticisms that undermine her argument that she has better judgment than Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate. Comey called her and her staff extremely careless and said that any reasonable government employee should have recognized that such information should not be aired in emails. Her server was so poorly secured the FBI could not eliminate the possibility it had not been hacked by the countrys enemies, Comey said. Asked if she agreed that she was extremely careless, Clinton told CNN she was not, adding that Comey had clarified his remarks. It was unclear what clarification Clinton meant. In lengthier comments before lawmakers on Thursday, Comey again spoke of Clintons and her staffs carelessness and real sloppiness, adding that it seemed she was not particularly sophisticated with respect to classified information.

"Faced with Trump and Clinton, Americans yearn for third choice: Reuters/Ipsos poll","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Americans demand for an alternative to the two main presidential candidates has surged since the last election, a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll shows, underscoring the unpopularity of Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. Based on 2,153 interviews, Fridays poll results suggest a strong potential for a third-party candidate - like Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party or Jill Stein of the Green Party - to take enough of the vote in the Nov. 8 presidential election to influence its outcome. According to the July 1-8 poll, 21 percent of likely voters will not back Trump or Clinton. That compares with about 13 percent of likely voters who opted out of the two main choices at the same point in the 2012 race between incumbent President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney. The poll also showed a majority of American voters have an overall unfavorable view of both main candidates, with 46 percent of Clinton supporters and 47 percent of Trump supporters saying their top priority when voting will be to stop the opposing candidate from reaching the White House. Demand for an alternative could be decisive in hotly contested battleground states. In Florida in 2012, for instance, Obama won by less than 1 percentage point. If this years race is just as tight, third-party candidates could draw enough support to flip the state from one major party to the other. Despite this, both Johnson and Stein have a problem that  make their influence hard to predict - most voters still do not know who they are. Of likely voters, 23 percent say they are at least somewhat familiar with Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico. That drops to 16 percent for Stein, a physician. Johnson could appeal to both liberals and conservatives. He wants to legalize marijuana and replace income and payroll taxes with a consumption tax.  Stein could make a strong bid to backers of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who ran a close race with Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination. Stein wants to abolish student debt and raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. She also aims for the country to run on renewable energy by 2030.  Steins communications coordinator, David Doonan, said that the campaign is working to boost her numbers and that the Green Party is circulating a letter that directly appeals to people who supported Sanders. He also started very low in the polls, Doonan said.  So far it appears that Johnson and Stein draw support evenly from Clinton and Trump when they are included in opinion polls. In a four-way race,45 percent of likely voters support Clinton, 34 percent Trump, 5 percent Johnson and 4 percent Stein, according to a separate five-day polling average on July 8.  That compares with46 percent for Clinton and 33 percent for Trump in a two-way race.  Given a little more information about the two alternative candidates, respondents who back Johnson and Stein draw more deeply from Clintons support. Some44 percent of likely voters support Clinton, 34 percent  Trump, 7 percent Johnson and 5 percent Stein, after reading the following statement, according to the poll: Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate for President, has taken an environmental position supporting a strong government role limiting carbon-based fuels, such as coal. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate for President, has supported severely limiting the governments role, including slashing taxes and reducing programs such as Medicare and the military and broadly decriminalizing currently illegal drugs. The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English with American adults in the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii. The survey of voters who want an alternative to Trump and Clinton included 2,153 likely voters and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points. The five-day average poll that ended July 8 included about 1,240 likely voters and has a credibility interval of 3 percentage points. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ U.S. Presidential Election 2016     cpurl://apps.cp./cms/?pageId=us-2016 GRAPHIC: Race to the White House    tmsnrt.rs/1Tr5O3e Tales from the Trail blog    here Reuters election newsletter    here Poll: Your vote for president (Clinton-Trump-Johnson-Stein)    polling.reuters.com/#poll/TM651Y15_26/filters/LIKELY:1 Poll: Your vote for president (Clinton-Trump)    polling.reuters.com/#!poll/TM651Y15_13/filters/LIKELY:1/type/smallest/dates/20160601-20160708/collapsed/true/spotlight/1 Poll: Your vote for president (Clinton-Trump-Johnson-Stein-No.2)    polling.reuters.com/#poll/TM952Y16/filters/LIKELY:1 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> ",politicsNews,"July 8, 2016 ",1
"Violence again convulses 2016 election campaign, testing Trump, Clinton","(Reuters) - In the hours after a gunman shot 12 police officers, killing five in Dallas, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton abruptly canceled campaign events. Their Twitter accounts largely went quiet. The shootings marked yet another convulsive event in the 2016 political season, one in which Clinton and Trump have scrambled to find the right response to terror attacks abroad, mass shootings at home, and protests over police killings of African Americans. Much of the violence, captured live on smartphones and endlessly replayed on cable television news, has fueled Americans fears about their personal safety, polls show. It has  evoked memories of 1968, when civil rights leader Martin Luther King and Democratic presidential candidate Robert Kennedy were assassinated in a turbulent era of protests against the Vietnam war and racial segregation. Were seeing wild acts of gun violence and we are polarized in our politics and in the public square, said historian Douglas Brinkley. Every 48 hours there seems to be some horrific event that jars and jerks our consciousness into a new dimension. Historically, uncertain times tend to push the party out of power. Witness Republican Ronald Reagans defeat of incumbent Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1980 during the Iran hostage crisis, or Obamas victory over Republican John McCain in 2008 as the U.S. economy collapsed. But that may not be the case for Trump, who has yet to convince a majority of Americans that his would be a steady hand at the tiller. Trumps initial reaction to Dallas suggested he understands the stakes. He issued a sober statement of unity that was unlike many of his public utterances that are often derided by critics as hyperbolic or inflammatory. Our nation has become too divided. Too many Americans feel like theyve lost hope. Crime is harming too many citizens. Racial tensions have gotten worse, not better. This isnt the American Dream we all want for our children, he said. This is a time, perhaps more than ever, for strong leadership, love and compassion. We will pull through these tragedies.   With race relations becoming a more prominent issue in the White House race, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a top contender to be Trumps vice presidential running mate, told Fox News that Trump and his No. 2 can help broaden their appeal by going to inner cities, where many African Americans live.In responding to the spasm of gun violence, Clinton has called for more regulations on the gun industry and has aligned herself with the Black Lives Matter movement, which campaigns against violence against African-Americans. In a round of TV appearances, Clinton said she had been working her whole life to try to bridge the racial divide. Her comments follow the police shooting of two black men in two separate incidents in Louisiana and Minnesota over the past week. The Dallas gunman told police he was angry about the killings. I will call for white people, like myself, to put ourselves in the shoes of those African American families ... who fear every time their children go somewhere. Im going to be talking about white people, Clinton said on CNN. Democratic strategist Bud Jackson said she is hitting the right tone. I dont think this is an issue that she needs to take advantage of, he said. In fact it would probably hurt her if she is perceived as taking advantage of it.  But the demand for change is sweeping among voters. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken over the last five weeks, nearly two-thirds of Americans feel the country is on the wrong track, reflecting their general unease with the economy, terror threats and violence. Her challenge is to show she can cope with these issues and that she would bring change and would not be the same, said presidential historian Thomas Alan Schwartz. Trump has said a Clinton win in the Nov. 8 election would amount to a third term for President Barack Obama. Clinton has embraced many of the policies of her former rival in the 2008 presidential election and campaigned with him this week. Lanhee Chen, who advised 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney and 2016 presidential candidate Marco Rubio, said a more civil discourse in American politics would help to calm peoples general fears.  I think theres bigger issue around civility and rhetoric and discourse and how our leaders appeal or dont appeal to our better angels. Thats really what this is about. I see this as an absence of leadership all around. ",politicsNews,"July 8, 2016 ",1
"U.S. Women's Open must leave Trump National, says Burk","(Reuters) - Fourteen years after criticizing Augusta National Golf Club for its all-male membership policy, womens issues expert Martha Burk has called for next years U.S. Womens Open to be moved from Trump National in New Jersey. In a blog for The Huffington Post on Friday, Burk lambasted tournament organizers, the United States Golf Association, for placing profit over principle and added a link to a petition to force the USGA to hold the event elsewhere. Seems the USGA, no stranger to hypocrisy, refuses to move next years U.S. Womens Open from the Trump-owned Bedminster club, even though the USGA issued a public statement condemning Trumps racist views after his Mexican rapist rant when he announced his candidacy, Burk wrote. Republican presidential candidate Trump has angered many people with his polarizing words on the campaign trail, including his promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, deport 11 million illegal immigrants and temporarily bar Muslims from entering the country. His antagonistic comments have already cost him in the golfing world. The elite PGA Grand Slam of Golf, a 36-hole stroke-play event that features the winners of the seasons four majors, was scrapped last year due to complications over the proposed venue, Trumps National course in Los Angeles. Last month, the PGA Tour announced that its long-established tournament in Miami would move from Trumps Doral course to Mexico City next year, a switch prompted by sponsorship issues. With the 2016 U.S. Womens Open being played this week at CordeValle in San Martin, California, Burk has turned her attention to next years edition, even though the protest is not over exclusionary policies at Bedminster, if there are any. She wrote: The objection is to one of the ruling bodies of golf kowtowing to Trumps overtly racist and sexist views. That shows where the USGA really stands, despite the lip-service-only condemnation a year ago. The USGA, PGA Tour, LPGA and PGA of America had distanced themselves from Trumps explosive comments in a joint statement issued last August. Burk referenced the Augusta National controversy, saying the USGA ignored its prohibition against holding events at clubs that discriminate on the basis of race or gender by standing solidly behind the Trump-like dinos holding the Masters Tournament - even though it was clearly in violation of their own by-laws. Augusta Nationals membership policy had been an issue for years, most notably in 2002 when Burk led a series of protests that prompted a heated war of words with Augustas then-chairman Hootie Johnson. There may well come a day when women will be invited to join our membership, but that timetable will be ours, and not at the point of a bayonet, Johnson declared at the time. Augusta National, home of the Masters golf tournament, finally ended an all-male policy that had endured for 80 years when it announced in August 2012 that two women would be admitted as members for the first time. Burk, a co-founder of the Center for Advancement of Public Policy, is director of the corporate accountability project for the National Council of Womens Organizations.

Dallas attack adds to Cleveland concerns before Republican convention,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Cleveland police on Friday tightened their security plan for the Republican National Convention after the deadly shootings of police officers in Dallas, increasing surveillance and intelligence operations just 10 days before the convention. Other police departments across the country required officers to patrol in pairs rather than alone following the ambush in Dallas, the deadliest day for police in the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. In Cleveland, the attack raised another potential threat during the July 18-21 convention, when Donald Trump is expected to receive the Republican nomination for president.  The police officers labor union, rank-and-file cops and some outside experts had already questioned Clevelands preparedness for the convention with the citys police under federal supervision over use of force. Ten days before the event, Cleveland was still training police officers for duty at the convention, which is expected to draw 50,000 visitors as well as clamorous protests and crown the most contentious presidential candidate in memory. Rather than a security team reinforced by the countrys largest police departments as it hoped, the city has cobbled together 3,000 officers, mostly from state agencies, who will use borrowed and rented equipment. When the convention was awarded to Cleveland (in 2014), folks werent thinking about this.... Yes, there is a generalized worry, said Matthew Barge, court-appointed monitor for the U.S. Justice Departments oversight of Cleveland police. Ed Tomba, the citys deputy police chief and head of convention security, had previously told Reuters he was very, very confident in the citys convention plan. He reiterated that confidence in a telephone interview on Friday in response to the Dallas attack. We have got to make some changes without a doubt, Tomba said, mentioning the surveillance of potential threats from street level and farther away.   We will have plenty of people watching over different locations. We are beefing up the intelligence component, too. They are going to be very, very active, Tomba said. Police throughout the United States ordered their officers to work in pairs following the shooting in Dallas, including those in New York, Chicago and St. Louis. New York officers will double up on all assignments and auxiliary police officers who are unarmed except for night sticks will not be used in the field for the next few days, Police Commissioner William Bratton told a news conference. St. Louis police also will be required to wear ballistic vests when leaving any station for enforcement activities, Chief Sam Dotson said on Twitter. Tomba said he spent part of Friday morning reassuring out-of-town police departments that their officers on loan to Cleveland will be safe during the convention, telling them in an email that we cannot pull the plan off without them. Cleveland police union President Steve Loomis has been among the most vocal critics, complaining that front-line officers would be undertrained and poorly equipped.  They are setting up my guys for failure, Loomis said before the Dallas attack. Civic leaders have said Cleveland is experiencing a renaissance following decades of decline, and that reputation will be on the line during the convention. Two separate incidents of fatal police shootings in recent years have brought unwelcome national attention to the city. In 2012, 13 Cleveland officers fired 137 shots into the car of an unarmed African-American man and his female passenger, killing both. The U.S. Justice Department investigated and imposed special federal oversight known as a consent decree that remains in force. Then in 2014, four months after the Republicans chose Cleveland for the convention, a white police officer shot dead 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was black, in a case that became a national focal point for the protest movement Black Lives Matter.  The most recent report from the federal monitor overseeing the Cleveland consent decree portrays a police department where physical infrastructure is strained, with computers and cars run-down or deficient, forcing police to pay for repairs out of their own pockets and use their personal vehicles for police  work.  Loomis, the union leader, said half of Cleveland police officers have yet to receive convention training. That number is probably close, Tomba said on Thursday. Upon getting the convention, Cleveland asked 200 police departments to send officers, including those from big cities which generally have the best anti-terrorist schooling. Many big cities turned Cleveland down, saying they were unable to spare officers, Tomba said. But Cleveland has exceeded its goal by bringing in 3,000 reinforcements who will receive training at home plus a short course upon arriving, Tomba said. ",politicsNews,"July 8, 2016 ",1
Florida congresswoman indicted in fraud scheme,"TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - A federal grand jury indicted U.S. Representative Corrine Brown of Florida and her chief of staff on fraud charges and other crimes, accusing them of funneling money for a bogus education charity to personal use, U.S. prosecutors said on Friday. The 69-year-old Democrat from Jacksonville, Florida, denied that she had used her political position to help raise more than $800,000 that donors believed supported college scholarships and other educational purposes.  According to the 53-page indictment filed in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida this week, funds donated to the group One Door for Education were used to pay for a golf tournament honoring Brown, luxury box seats at a Beyonce concert, a football game and other personal expenses. Prosecutors noted that the organization was not properly registered as a non-profit group and awarded only two scholarships totaling $1,200. I am innocent of the charges announced today, and intend to vigorously defend myself in court against these politically motivated allegations, Brown said in a statement. She said she would temporarily step down from her role as the Ranking Member of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Veterans Affairs due to House rules. The 24-count indictment also accuses her chief of staff, Elias Ronnie Simmons, 50, of multiple counts of fraud. There was no immediate response from Browns office to requests for comment from Simmons.  During a court appearance on Friday, Brown and Simmons pleaded not guilty, local media reported. It is incredibly disappointing that an elected official, who took an oath year after year to serve others, would exploit the needs of children and abuse the charitable hearts of constituents to advance her own personal and political agendas and deliver them with virtually nothing, Michelle Klimt, special agent in charge of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation division in Jacksonville, said in a statement. Brown was elected to Congress in 1992 as one of the first three black members of Floridas congressional delegation since the Reconstruction period following the Civil War. Now seeking re-election, she faces a primary challenge in a redrawn district. Her indictment follows the June conviction of U.S. Representative Chaka Fattah of Philadelphia for orchestrating multiple frauds to enrich himself and preserve his political career. He subsequently resigned. Prosecutors said Simmons misused his position to help a relative obtain government employment and receive more than $735,000 without doing work. They said he diverted more than $80,000 of his relatives salary for his own personal use. Brown is also accused of falsifying her tax filings. ",politicsNews,"July 8, 2016 ",1
Options market signals little fear of election-tied volatility,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The November U.S. presidential election is being sold by the major parties as a defining moment for the next generation of Americans. But stock and options traders, often moved to action by political headlines, are responding with a big meh. Options bets on volatility around the Nov. 8 election are running lower than could be expected given how stocks have performed in past election cycles, BNP Paribas said. Typically, stock market volatility picks up around presidential elections. Traders use options to guard against outsized market reaction to such events. The CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed gauge of near-term investor anxiety, had some big spikes this year, hitting a four-month high after the Brexit vote. But there is little to suggest that November is a big worry for stocks. Investors are focused on the quarterly earnings season starting next week. They might also be taking the view that both the Republican and Democratic prospective nominees would be more favorable for business than the current administration, analysts said. Its like the opposite of Alien vs. Predator, said Mark Sebastian, chief investment officer at volatility arbitrage hedge fund Karman Line Capital in Chicago, referring to the 2004 American science fiction film which had the tagline whoever wins, we lose. Here, no matter who wins, Wall Street does better, he said. Despite being called anti-business by some on Wall Street, the Obama administration has been in power over one of the best presidential cycles for stocks on record. Per BNP Paribas data, S&P 500 Index options forward implied volatility, which measures volatility expectations embedded in options, shows no dislocation over the remaining election campaign period. Had there been a big bump-up in this measure for November it would have been a sign that traders were loading up on protective contracts. The market is not ascribing a large probability to a high volatility scenario over the election period, said Stewart Warther, an equity derivatives strategist at BNP Paribas. Market-makers, or dealers which quote prices for options, are also not expressing a great deal of anxiety over stock gyrations. If stock volatility does not pick up in November, that would be a departure from the norm, according a BNP Paribas analysis of data going back to 1948. The shape of the (volatility) curve definitely is upward sloping but its not like there is a huge hump out in November, said Steve Sosnick, an equity risk manager at Timber Hill, the market-making unit of Interactive Brokers Group Inc. We have seen some demand for options but I would say its hardly a frenzy. ",politicsNews,"July 8, 2016 ",1
U.S. House panel approves Benghazi report after two-year probe,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives special Benghazi committee approved its report on Friday on the attack in Libya that killed four Americans in 2012, but the Republican-led panel set no date for ending its work after a two-year-long investigation. The committees chairman, Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, said the panel voted to approve the 800-page report, with seven Republicans in favor and four Democrats opposed, in a closed-door meeting. Republicans had issued the report on June 28. It included no major new revelations about the assault in Benghazi that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. But it criticized presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time of the violence, saying both she and her staff showed a shameful lack of response to congressional investigators looking into the attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound.  It also accused Clintons State Department of failing to protect the Americans killed. Last October, Clinton, already a Democratic presidential candidate, calmly deflected harsh Republican criticism of her handling of the attack during a testy 11-hour hearing before Gowdys committee. Democrats have derided the report as a political vendetta against the former secretary of state. Republicans said the committees work would not wrap up until materials related to the report are reviewed for classified information and potential perjury claims, which would be referred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. If you thought a vote today would be the end of this partisan chapter of our history, you would be wrong, Representative Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the panel, said in a statement. The Select Committee is poised to last for months - perhaps until right before the presidential election - and that appears to be the Republican plan, Cummings said. Republicans plan more interviews, including one next week with Stephen Hedger, the head of legislative affairs at the Department of Defense, Cummings said. Panel Republicans issued a joint statement calling the investigation a great privilege and honor. They urged President Barack Obamas administration to clear for public release all of the supporting evidence and documents referenced in the report. ",politicsNews,"July 8, 2016 ",1
U.S. Democrats' infighting over trade pact puts Clinton in middle,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton has found herself in the middle of a fight within the U.S. Democratic Party over the Pacific Rim trade pact, between President Barack Obama, who backs the deal, and opponents whose help is crucial to her White House bid. A showdown over trade is expected on Friday and Saturday when Democratic officials meet in Orlando, Florida, to negotiate language for the partys 2016 platform, which sets policy priorities intended to guide campaign messages in the Nov. 8 election. Different factions of the party are deadlocked over platform language on the sweeping Trans Pacific Partnership, which Obama hopes to push through the U.S. Congress later this year. The current draft, which will be ratified at the July 25-28 Democratic convention in Philadelphia, acknowledgesa diversity of views over the TPP. While the platform is not binding for candidates, it is a symbol of a partys core values. Labor unions and other TPP critics have called for a clear condemnation of the pact, which they fear could lead to steep U.S. job losses in manufacturing. But some Democrats say that would risk undercutting Obama. U.S. Representative Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, a Clinton appointee to the platform committee, told the Washington Post that while he had a long history of opposing trade pacts, he did not want Democrats on the other side of the issue to think they are not important. Gutierrez also said he thought disregarding the position of the president of the United States was not right. The intra-party rift has created a quandary for Clinton, the Democrats presumptive nominee. She has staked out opposition to the TPP during her campaign after supporting it while she was secretary of state in the Obama administration. Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has accused her of waffling on trade. Trump has strongly condemned the deal, calling it horrible. If Clinton embraces platform language condemning the TPP, it would please unions while causing difficulties for Obama, one of her most enthusiastic supporters. Moreover, if the platform committee cannot come up with language that satisfies Bernie Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont who had also sought the nomination and still wields considerable clout, the fight might drag into the Philadelphia convention and create a messy spectacle where Democrats will formally nominate Clinton for the White House. Labor unions told the Clinton campaign of their frustrations in a closed-door meeting on June 30. One of a series of occasional sessions to update unions supporting her on campaign staffing, logistics and other issues, it concluded with a brief question-and-answer session where AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka asked about the pact. The (platforms) language now is unacceptable, Hasan Solomon, the legislative director oftheInternational Association of MachinistsandAerospace Workers, told Reuters. Themachinists werethe first industrial union to endorse Clinton and remain strong backersof her candidacy. Union activists aligned with Sanders were even more blunt. When I saw the language, my reaction was: What are they thinking? saidRafael Navar, national political director for the Communications Workers of America, which endorsed Sanders. The only way to challenge Trumps appeal to millions of working-class voters in critical swing states is to be 100 percent crystal clear on opposing TPP and other job-killing trade deals. Many union activists also voiced their opposition to the deal to Paul Booth, executive assistant to the president of the American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees, at a private June 1 meeting hosted by the AFL-CIO. Booth is among the platform drafting committee members suggested by Clinton. To push for changes to the TPP platform language, Sanders has encouraged his millions of supporters in emails and texts to register their dissatisfaction. But Obamas support for the deal makes it hard for the party to come out against it too forcefully, said Jamal Simmons, a Democratic political consultant with the Raben Group.  Meanwhile, the platform committee expects more amendments to be offered in Orlando.  The point of this process, said committee spokeswoman Dana Vickers Shelley, is to hear what peoples concerns are.

Justice Department opens criminal probe into black Louisiana man's death,"BATON ROUGE, La. (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into the fatal police shooting of a black man in Louisianas capital, the states governor said on Thursday, as two deadly encounters between law enforcement and black men triggered protests in the United States. The probe comes as community leaders in Baton Rouge urged authorities to conduct a full-scale criminal probe of two white police officers over the slaying of Alton Sterling, 37, on Tuesday.  I want you to know that a criminal investigation is under way. It is being led by the U.S. Department of Justice, Louisiana Governor Jon Bel Edwards told hundreds of people at Living Faith Cathedral in Baton Rouge on Thursday evening.  We are going to come out of this tragedy stronger and more united than ever, he added. Sterling was pinned to the ground and fatally shot in the chest outside a convenience store after the officers responded to what police said was a call about a black man reported to have made threats with a gun. The Justice Department said on Wednesday it would conduct a civil rights investigation into Sterlings death.  The citys mayor and police chief welcomed the move, but community leaders said they worried the probe would be too limited and urged authorities to consider all possible federal and state criminal charges against officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake. We dont want this to be a narrow investigation, Edgar Cage, a spokesman for the community organization Together Baton Rouge, said at a church earlier on Thursday. We plan to use this tragic event as a tool, a stimulant to change the culture. President Barack Obama said in a statement he had full confidence in the Justice Departments ability to conduct a thoughtful, thorough and fair inquiry into Sterlings death. Citing an unnamed law enforcement official, CNN reported on Thursday that a homeless man placed the 911 call after seeking money from Sterling, who was selling CDs outside the store. The 300-pound (135-kg) Sterling showed the man his gun and said to leave him alone, the official told CNN. Reuters could not independently confirm that account with Baton Rouge police, who did not respond to a request for comment. Sterling, a father of five, had several criminal convictions since the mid-1990s for battery, resisting arrest, burglary and other crimes. He was a registered sex offender after spending nearly four years in prison on a charge he had sex with a 14-year-old girl when he was 20. COMMUNITY-POLICE CHASM Sterlings death was the first of two fatal police shootings of black men in two days. Philando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer during a traffic stop on Wednesday near Minneapolis. The shootings and videos showing their bloody aftermath have sparked protests, including an overnight rally in Baton Rouge that drew about 300 people who stood in a peaceful vigil near the Triple S Food Mart where Sterling was killed. Obama said that all Americans should be deeply troubled by the two deaths, which he said were indicative of wider problems in the U.S. criminal justice system. At the Baton Rouge church on Thursday, Edwards said there would be a new focus on training and retraining in the police department, and stressed the need to introduce people to the police at an early age.  His words appeared to address concerns voiced by many community leaders in recent days about a chasm between the black community and the police.  Video recorded by a bystanders cellphone showed an officer confronting Sterling and ordering him to the ground. The two officers then tackled him to the pavement, with one pulling a gun from his holster and pointing it at Sterlings chest. One officer shot Sterling five times at close range, and the other took something from his pants pocket as he was dying, another video recorded by Abdullah Muflahi, owner of the store where Sterling was killed in the parking lot, showed. Police said Sterling was armed. Muflahi said in an interview that police took a gun out of Sterlings pocket after shooting him. Officers Lake and Salamoni have been put on administrative leave, police said. In Lakes three years and Salamonis four years on the force, both have been cleared by the police department after prior complaints against them regarding use of force, the Advocate newspaper reported, citing records. The deaths of Sterling and Castile were the latest in a string of incidents in recent years involving police treatment of black men and boys in cities including Baltimore, Chicago, New York and Cleveland.

Obama says more must be done to address U.S. police shootings,"WARSAW, Poland (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Friday made an impassioned plea for the nation to do more to address the combative relationship between local police forces and the black and Hispanic communities they serve, after the shootings of two black men by police in Minnesota and Louisiana in two days. When incidents like this occur, theres a big chunk of our fellow citizenry that feels as if because of the color of their skin they are not being treated the same, Obama said shortly after landing early Friday morning in Warsaw, Poland, for a NATO summit. And that should trouble all of us. This is not just a black issue. Its not just a Hispanic issue. This is an American issue that we should all care about, he said. The deaths of Philando Castile at a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, and Alton Sterling outside a convenience store in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were the latest in a string of shootings that have led to calls for a revamp in the way police interact with the black community. Citing statistics that show that blacks are more likely to be killed by police officers and receive harsher sentences than their white counterparts, Obama said it is incumbent on all of us to say we can do better than this. A White House task force on better policing tactics issued recommendations last year on how to improve community relations with law enforcement. Obama encouraged local police forces to adopt the practices outlined by the task force, saying that less distrust of police would help to keep officers safe and lead to less deadly shootings by authorities. Critics of the push to reform local police tactics have charged that Obama has not shown enough concern about police officers who are shot in the line of duty. Obama repeatedly stressed that he believes that most police officers do their jobs without bias and that addressing complaints about police brutality would not undermine law enforcement. When people say black lives matter, that doesnt mean blue lives dont matter. It just means that all lives matter, but right now the big concern is the fact that data shows black folks are more vulnerable to these kinds of attacks, he said. Earlier on Thursday, Obama issued a Facebook post urging the nation to address the appearance or reality of racial bias in policing. ",politicsNews,"July 8, 2016 ",1
U.S. GMO food labeling bill passes Senate,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday approved legislation that would for the first time require food to carry labels listing genetically-modified ingredients, which labeling supporters say could create loopholes for some U.S. crops. The Senate voted 63-30 for the bill that would display GMO contents with words, pictures or a bar code that can be scanned with smartphones. The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) would decide which ingredients would be considered genetically modified. The measure now goes to the House of Representatives, where it is expected to pass. Drawing praise from farmers, the bill sponsored by Republican Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas and Democrat Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan is the latest attempt to introduce a national standard that would override state laws, including Vermonts that some say is more stringent, and comes amid growing calls from consumers for greater transparency. This bipartisan bill ensures that consumers and families throughout the United States will have access, for the first time ever, to information about their food through a mandatory, nationwide label for food products with GMOs, Stabenow said in a statement. A nationwide standard is favored by the food industry, which says state-by-state differences could inflate costs for labeling and distribution. But mandatory GMO labeling of any kind would still be seen as a loss for Big Food, which has spent millions lobbying against it. Farmers lobbied against the Vermont law, worrying that labeling stigmatizes GMO crops and could hurt demand for food containing those ingredients, but have applauded this law.     Critics like Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, say the bills vague language and allowance for electronic labels for scanning could limit its scope and create confusion. When parents go to the store and purchase food, they have the right to know what is in the food their kids are going to be eating, Sanders said on the floor of the Senate ahead of the vote. He said at a news conference this week that major food manufacturers have already begun labeling products with GMO ingredients to meet the new law in his home state. Another opponent of the bill, Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, said it would institute weak federal requirements making it virtually impossible for consumers to access information about GMOs. Food ingredients like beet sugar and soybean oil, which can be derived from genetically-engineered crops but contain next to no genetic material by the time they are processed, may not fall under the laws definition of a bioengineered food, critics say. GMO corn may also be excluded thanks to ambiguous language, some said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) raised concerns about the involvement of the USDA in a list of worries sent in a June 27 memo to the Senate Agriculture Committee. In a letter to Stabenow last week, the USDAs general counsel tried to quell those worries, saying it would include commercially-grown GMO corn, soybeans, sugar and canola crops. The vast majority of corn, soybeans and sugar crops in the United States are produced from genetically-engineered seeds. The domestic sugar market has been strained by rising demand for non-GMO ingredients like cane sugar. The United States is the worlds largest market for foods made with genetically altered ingredients. Many popular processed foods are made with soybeans, corn and other biotech crops whose genetic traits have been manipulated, often to make them resistant to insects and pesticides. Its fair to say that its not the ideal bill, but it is certainly the bill that can pass, which is the most important right now, said American Soybean Associations (ASA) director of policy communications Patrick Delaney. The association was part of the Coalition for Safe and Affordable Food, which lobbied for what labeling supporters termed the Deny Americans the Right to Know, or DARK Act, that would have made labeling voluntary. It was blocked by the Senate in March. ",politicsNews,"July 8, 2016 ",1
State Department to conduct internal probe of Clinton email case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Thursday it will conduct an internal review of whether Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her aides mishandled classified information, after the Justice Department declined to bring criminal charges. The State Department said in April it had suspended plans for an internal review at the request of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which conducted a yearlong probe of Clintons use of private email servers while she was secretary of state. Given the Department of Justice has now made its announcement, the State Department intends to conduct its internal review, State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. I cannot provide specific information about the Departments review, including what information we are evaluating. We will aim to be as expeditious as possible, but we will not put artificial deadlines on the process, he said. On Wednesday, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said she would accept the recommendations of the FBI not to bring criminal charges against Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election. FBI Director James Comey said on Tuesday Clinton had been extremely careless in the handling of classified information, and Republicans have criticized the decision not to prosecute. Comey told a congressional hearing on Thursday that FBI employees who mishandled classified material in the way Clinton did as secretary of state could be subject to dismissal or loss of security clearance.

Obama says confident Britain will have orderly Brexit transition: FT,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said he was confident that Britain and the European Union would be able to agree an orderly transition to a new relationship after last months Brexit vote. As difficult as it will be, I am confident that the UK and the EU will be able to agree on an orderly transition to a new relationship, Obama said in an article for the Financial Times, calling upon NATO to stand united against global challenges. The special relationship between the US and the UK will endure. I have no doubt that the UK will remain one of Natos most capable members. Obama urged NATO to unite following Britains June 23 vote to leave the EU and stressed that the alliance between the United States and its closest ally in Europe would endure Brexit.

FBI chief says his staff would face discipline for handling emails the way Clinton did,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI Director James Comey told U.S. lawmakers on Thursday that FBI employees who mishandled classified material in the way Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state could be subject to dismissal or loss of security clearance.   Comey addressed the issue at a House of Representatives committee hearing that lasted nearly five hours after House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a letter to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper that Clinton should be denied classified briefings during her campaign for the presidency. Comey, who said on Tuesday he would not recommend that the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee face criminal charges, was asked at the hearing if Clinton should face administrative punishment for the way she handled her email. I dont think thats for me to recommend, he said. Comey did say his employees in the Federal Bureau of Investigation would face discipline for the same behavior. They might get fired, they might lose their clearance, it might get suspended for 30 days, Comey said. There would be some discipline. Presidential candidates normally get access to classified information once they are formally nominated. As director of the FBI, Comey does not have the authority to revoke Clintons security privileges. A group of Republican senators on Thursday asked the State Department to immediately suspend clearances for Clinton and several current and former aides based on the agencys findings.  The State Department said on Thursday it would conduct an internal review of Clintons handling of the emails now that the FBI investigation was over. The department said in April it had suspended plans for a review at the FBIs request. I cannot provide specific information about the Departments review, including what information we are evaluating. We will aim to be as expeditious as possible, but we will not put artificial deadlines on the process, State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. A Clinton spokesman on Thursday criticized the congressional hearing for its partisan motivations, and expressed confidence that Comeys testimony had shut down any lingering conspiracy theories on the matter.  Director Comeys testimony clearly knocked down a number of false Republican talking points and reconciled apparent contradictions between his previous remarks and Hillary Clintons public statements, spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement.  The issue of Clintons use of private email servers has cast a cloud over her campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election, raising questions among voters about her trustworthiness and judgment and giving her Republican presidential rival, Donald Trump, an avenue of attack. Comeys testimony marked the first time he took questions publicly since his announcement the FBI was not recommending charges against Clinton. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch accepted the FBI recommendation and was to appear at another hearing next Tuesday.  Comey had disappointed some Republicans by only rebuking Clinton, not recommending charges against her, for what he called her extremely careless handling of classified information while using private email servers.  Under persistent questioning at the hearing of the House Oversight Committee, Comey said Clinton did not break the law. The question I always look at is, is there evidence that would establish beyond a reasonable doubt that somebody engaged in conduct that violated a criminal statute. And my judgment here is there is not, Comey said.    Comey also said Clinton knew her email server at her home in Chappaqua, New York, was not authorized to receive classified information. But Clinton may not have had sufficiently sophisticated understanding to know the emails that passed through her personal server were classified, Comey said. Only three of the FBI-reviewed emails were explicitly marked as classified and those were marked with a C in the body of the email, not in the header, he said. Comey said his FBI team conducted its investigation of Clinton in an apolitical and professional way and he had no reason to believe she had lied to the FBI. Clinton had said publicly she never sent or received any classified information. I think there is a legitimate concern that there is a double standard, if your name isnt Clinton or you are not part of the powerful elite that Lady Justice will act differently, U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said to Comey at the beginning of the hearing. A Democratic member of the committee, Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, defended Comeys actions by saying: I firmly believe your decision was based on conviction, not convenience. Comey, a Republican who was appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama and also served in the administration of former Republican President George W. Bush, has built a reputation as a straight shooter who does not bend to pressure from either party. He has differed sharply with the Obama administration, including over the case of General David Petraeus, who pleaded guilty after he knowingly shared classified information with his biographer and lover. Comey recommended Petraeus be charged with a felony, but then-Attorney General Eric Holder downgraded the charge to a misdemeanor. The hearing took place as Trump met with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill to get them behind his candidacy, discussing a variety of issues, including his campaign style. Im going to make you proud, Trump told House Republicans, according to a participant, Representative Bill Flores. ",politicsNews,"July 7, 2016 ",1
Trump stars and spars with Republican lawmakers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump endured some blunt exchanges when he met Republican members of Congress on Thursday but several lawmakers, including past critics, emerged with encouraging words about their presumptive White House nominee. Republican aides cited good attendance from both houses of Congress at the two closed-door meetings, even though some lawmakers made a point of staying away, citing previous commitments. The New York businessman-turned-politician has sought in speeches and meetings in recent weeks to unite the party behind his unorthodox candidacy and to reassure Republican leaders about his conservative credentials. In a Miami speech on Friday, Trump will say the economic policies of Democrats like President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the partys presumptive nominee, have harmed minorities, said Steve Moore, a Trump economic policy adviser.   Trump drew 41 of 54 Republican senators to the U.S. Senate meeting where he called out three senators who had been critical of his candidacy, according to Republican aides familiar with the meeting. Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort said the meetings with lawmakers were positive and productive, adding characterizations of discord attributed to unnamed sources, are wholly inaccurate.   Trump also met privately with Senator Ted Cruz, his former rival for the Republican nomination. They did not discuss an endorsement but Cruz did accept Trumps invitation to speak at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland the week of July 18, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said. At the first session on Thursday, with members of the House of Representatives, Trump shared a hug with House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican who has often criticized Trump even while endorsing him, lawmakers said. They joked a bit about some of their past exchanges during an hour-long session, and Trump took questions. Im going to make you proud, Representative Bill Flores quoted Trump as saying. Trump won grassroots support during months of state-by-state nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election with a pledge to ban Muslims temporarily from entering the United States and to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. He regularly annoys party leaders with inflammatory remarks. Flores, a Texan who heads the Republican Study Committee, the largest conservative grouping in Congress, had criticized Trump, including for having questioned a U.S. judges motives because of his Mexican ethnicity. Flores had said he wanted to see more vision and less trash talk from the presumptive nominee. After Thursdays session, Flores said he felt better about Trump. Based on what I have heard today, Ive got the confidence that you are going to see a lot more in terms of visionary messaging, Flores said. Today was extremely positive, said New York Republican Peter King, another representative who has criticized Trump. There was not one negative moment. But not everyone was won over. I need to be persuaded, said Representative Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania who said he would not support either Trump or  Clinton. Trumps session with Republican senators sounded more turbulent. The Washington Post reported details of a combative exchange between Trump and Senator Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who has expressed concern that Trumps comments on immigration will cause Hispanic voters in the state to reject him. When Flake stood up and introduced himself, Trump told him, Youve been very critical of me, the Post said. Yes, Im the other senator from Arizona  the one who didnt get captured  and I want to talk to you about statements like that, Flake responded, referring to Trumps past dismissal of Senator John McCains record as a prisoner during the Vietnam war. The senator urged Trump to stop attacking Mexicans; Trump predicted that Flake would lose his re-election, at which point Flake informed Trump that Flake was not up for re-election this year. Flakes spokesman Jason Samuels said the Post account was accurate. Trump also turned to Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who has refused to endorse him, and said something along the lines of Surely you dont want Clinton, one Republican aide said of the session. Trump said he would win also in Illinois, the home state of a third Republican critic, Senator Mark Kirk, who is in a tight re-election race and recently withdrew his endorsement of Trump. Hes wrong, Kirk told reporters several hours later. I think Trump is going to get a vote like Alan Keyes got, which is about 28 percent, Kirk said, referring to the Republican who ran unsuccessfully for senator against Obama in Illinois in 2004.   Trumps Twitter posting as he left Washington showed no sign of discord. Very interesting day! These are people who love our country! he tweeted. ",politicsNews,"July 7, 2016 ",1
U.S. Democrats pressure Republicans for bipartisan Zika funding,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House and congressional Democrats pressured Republicans on Thursday for bipartisan Zika-funding legislation, saying the public health battle against the mosquito-borne virus is being undercut by efforts to ram through a bill with less funding. But there was no sign that Republicans would abandon their $1.1 billion measure, raising the chance that Congress will leave the growing health crisis unattended until September.  In a conference call, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the lack of funding has made it difficult for the health agency to ramp up mosquito-control and diagnostic testing and pursue new research. President Barack Obama asked the Republican-controlled Congress in February for $1.9 billion in emergency funding to fight Zika. But as lawmakers prepare to leave for a seven-week recess on July 15, Senate Democrats who defeated the Republican measure last week predict it will only fail again. We are at the 11th hour and 59th minute before Congress is gone all summer, said Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, which is among a number of southern U.S. states likely to be hard-hit by the Zika virus. U.S. health officials say Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies.  Over the past few days, Obama has urged Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democrats to adopt a bipartisan approach. On Thursday, Democrats called on McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan to revive a bipartisan measure that passed the Senate in May. McConnell has said he would stick with the current legislation, which was agreed by House and Senate negotiators and has already passed the House.  A senior Senate Republican aide dismissed the call for change as cover for Democratic efforts to block the Republican measure. A Ryan spokeswoman said: We hope Senate Democrats do the right thing and end their filibuster. Even some Democratic aides expressed skepticism that McConnell or Ryan would change course.        The CDC is monitoring 320 pregnant U.S. women with laboratory evidence of Zika infection. In Puerto Rico, where Zika has been rampant for months, as many as 50 pregnant women are infected every day, CDC Director Thomas Frieden said. Altogether, there are more than 1,130 Zika cases in the United States, the CDC said. All contracted the virus outside the United States, in a lab or through unprotected sex.  Frieden said the CDC has spent most of the $222 million it has received for Zika in the United States on state and municipal efforts, funding, staffing and equipment. Its frankly difficult to navigate with so many unknowns, Frieden said. Thats why we havent been able to do things like begin ramping up centers of excellence to improve the performance of diagnostic tests, of mosquito control and to begin some of the really in-depth studies. Additional funding would also aid vaccine research and help community health centers in areas with the highest Zika transmission rates.  The Republican measure failed in the Senate on June 28 when Democrats objected to Republican provisions, including one to prevent Planned Parenthood from receiving funds to combat what can be sexually transmitted infection. The legislation would also take money from battling the Ebola virus and from funds set aside to implement the Obamacare health insurance program in U.S. territories. Theyll force yet another failed vote on this cynical legislation and then pack their bags for the longest Senate vacation since 1954, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said. The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults. The connection between Zika and microcephaly first came to light last fall in Brazil, which has now confirmed more than 1,600 cases of microcephaly that it considers to be related to Zika infections in the mothers.

Sanders expected to endorse Clinton on Tuesday: New York Times,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Bernie Sanders is expected to endorse presidential rival Hillary Clinton on Tuesday at a campaign event in New Hampshire, The New York Times reported on Thursday. Citing three Democrats who have been involved in the planning, the Times said the endorsement was partly the result of daily talks between the candidates campaign managers about bringing them together and advancing Sanders policy priorities. The Sanders campaign declined to comment. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, has resisted endorsing Clinton in a show of party unity since she clinched the Democratic nomination last month. Sanders chose to continue his campaign as leverage to win concessions on his liberal policy agenda and reforms to the Democratic Party nominating process. In a speech to supporters last month, Sanders vowed to help Clinton defeat Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election but did not end his campaign. Sanders risked being left behind, however, as other prominent Democrats have rallied around Clinton, including President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a favorite of the partys liberal wing. Clinton, who shifted to the left under pressure from Sanders during the campaign, adopted another of his issues on Wednesday when she proposed eliminating tuition at public colleges and universities for in-state students whose families earn less than $125,000 annually. Sanders endorsement is expected to ensure he has a prominent speaking slot at the Democratic convention later this month, the Times quoted the three Democrats as saying.

"Trump adviser, on Moscow visit, dodges questions about U.S. policy on Russia","MOSCOW (Reuters) - A foreign-policy adviser to U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump avoided all questions about how the United States should shape its policy toward Russia on a visit to Moscow on Thursday. Carter Page said at a lecture he gave to students and business figures organized by Moscows New Economic School that he did not want to comment on the U.S. election campaign. Page declined to say whether he was planning to meet anyone from the Kremlin, the Russian government or Foreign Ministry during his visit. Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination for the U.S. presidential election, has made contradictory comments about Russia but made headlines with warm words for President Vladimir Putin.  Putin called Trump very talented, fuelling speculation the Kremlin would be pleased to see Trump in the White House, but later rowed back from those comments. In his lecture on Thursday, Trumps adviser Page said Western governments had often had a hypocritical focus on democratization, corruption and inequality in the post-Soviet world. He also accused the United States and its partners of proactive steps to encourage regime change overseas. This may understandably advance a certain level of insecurity, Page said. Relations between the United States and Russia have deteriorated sharply under U.S. leader Barack Obama, undermined by disagreements over the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. The Obama administration imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014 over Russias annexation of Ukraines Crimea region and fights on the opposing side of the five-year-old Syrian civil war. Page worked in Russia for U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch in the mid-2000s and said in an interview with Bloomberg in March that he was an investor in Russian gas producer Gazprom.

U.S. lawmakers blast Obama administration over ex-Guantanamo prisoner,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers sharply criticized President Barack Obamas administration on Thursday over the disappearance of a former Guantanamo detainee, calling for an end to transfers from the prison because of fears former prisoners could launch attacks on Americans. They also raised concerns about reports that Jihad Diyab, a Syrian among six detainees resettled in Uruguay in December 2014, has disappeared and may now be in Brazil. Obama is working to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, where terrorism suspects have been held for 15 years, by transferring detainees not considered security threats to foreign countries. Republican lawmakers worry that the Obama administration is so eager to close the prison before he leaves office in January that it is sending detainees to countries that cannot ensure they will not return to the battlefield by joining militant groups that target Americans and U.S. allies. Youre talking about detainees who have every intent of killing American families, Republican Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina said at a House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. The administration has considered sending Guantanamo detainees to a prison in South Carolina. The New York Times reported that Diyab said last month he was going on a religious retreat that would last into next week, and would be unreachable by telephone or email. Since then, some Uruguayan officials said they lost track of him and suggested he may have traveled to Brazil, the newspaper reported. Many countries just arent up to the job, said Republican Representative Ed Royce, the committees chairman. ... Yet the administration has sent Guantanamo terrorists to these countries anyway. Republican and some Democratic committee members sharply questioned Lee Wolosky, the State Departments special envoy for closing the Guantanamo detention center, and Paul Lewis, his Pentagon counterpart. Representative Jeff Duncan, another South Carolina Republican, said Diyab, charged with forging passports for al Qaeda, could pose a threat to the upcoming Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, if he were indeed at large in that country. The committees ranking Democrat, Representative Eliot Engel, who backs the closure of the detention center in Cuba, said it was important to keep the issue in perspective. Under no circumstances, in my opinion, is the Obama administration simply opening the gate and releasing dangerous terrorists onto the street, Engel said.   Lewis and Wolosky said only 5 percent of detainees transferred since Obama became president have been confirmed to have returned to the battlefield. The percentage was higher for the over 500 released under President George W. Bush. There are currently 79 detainees at Guantanamo, of whom 29 are eligible for transfer. Wolosky acknowledged Diyab had been difficult from the time he was transferred to Uruguay. According to the Times, Diyabs friends and supporters say he is off praying and will re-emerge soon. Obama has been trying to make good on his 2009 pledge to close the facility. But Congress has passed laws making it more difficult to do so, chiefly by barring transfers to U.S. prisons. Lawmakers are unlikely to lift those restrictions, especially in an election year. They have proposed even tighter controls on transfers in a fiscal 2017 defense policy bill, one reason Obama has threatened a veto. Guantanamo opponents say holding prisoners for years without charge or trial goes against fundamental U.S. values and since they are Muslims, is a recruiting tool for Islamist militants. Many Republicans insist the prison is an essential tool for handling suspects who threaten the United States. Donald Trump, the partys presumptive 2016 presidential nominee, has called for the prisons expansion. ",politicsNews,"July 7, 2016 ",1
House Speaker Ryan: all options on table over Democrats' gun sit-in,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday all options were being considered over the possible discipline of House Democrats for protests they held on the House floor to call for action on gun-control measures. With Democrats already rejecting a Republican gun bill and warning of further protests, the Republican-controlled House appeared to be heading for renewed discord over gun restrictions following the June 12 mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Ryan, who was speaking at a news conference, had previously said the House would vote this week on a measure intended to keep guns out of the hands of people the government suspects of involvement in violent extremism. But it is no longer clear when a vote might be held. Democrats say the Republican-backed legislation is inadequate because authorities would have only three days to convince a judge that a gun sale should be blocked. ",politicsNews,"July 7, 2016 ",1
IMF's Lagarde warns against Trump-style protectionism: FT,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde warned in an interview published on Thursday that anti-trade policies like those championed by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump risked a protectionist movement that could severely damage global growth. Lagarde told the Financial Times that with Britains vote to leave the European Union already casting a shadow over global growth, the imposition of new trade barriers in another larger economy could have disastrous effects. I think it would be quite disastrous, actually. Well I dont think I should say disastrous because that is an excessive word and I should refrain from excessive words. But it would certainly have a negative impact on global growth, she told the FT in response to a question about such policies. The newspaper said that while Lagarde made clear her negative views of anti-trade rhetoric and policies, she refrained from referring to Trump by name or singling out any politician. Lagarde also told the FT that she doubted that a prolonged period of uncertainty over Britains exit, without triggering formal separation negotiations, would be politically sustainable. We want to see clarity sooner rather than later because we think that a lack of clarity feeds uncertainty, which itself undermines investment appetites and decision making, Lagarde told the newspaper. In a separate interview with Agence France Presse, Lagarde said Brexit was unlikely to cause a world recession, adding that the immediate effects would hurt the UK, with some spillover to the euro area. She told AFP that proposals in Britain to cut corporate tax rates to 15 percent from 20 percent to counter the damage caused by the UKs EU divorce was a race to the bottom that would hurt other economies.

U.S. House speaker asks that Clinton be denied classified data,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top Republicans in the U.S. Congress pressed for sanctions on Thursday against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information, with House Speaker Paul Ryan formally asking she be denied such information during the campaign. Ryan, the top Republican in the House of Representatives, sent a letter to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper saying denying Clinton access to classified information would be an appropriate sanction for her mishandling of classified data while she was secretary of state. Ten Republican senators said on Thursday they had written Secretary of State John Kerry asking that the State Department immediately suspend security clearances of Clinton and aides Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills, Jake Sullivan and other former State Department employees for security violations. The calls for sanctions against Clinton come after FBI Director James Comey rebuked her on Tuesday for extremely careless handling of classified information while using private email servers for business while secretary of state during President Barack Obamas first term. Comey recommended no criminal charges be filed but indicated administrative sanctions could be taken against Clinton or her aides. Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Wednesday accepted Comeys recommendation that no criminal charges were warranted and closed the case. Republican lawmakers and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump have expressed outrage that the case was not being pursued. Ryan, in a letter dated Wednesday, formally asked Clapper to refrain from providing any classified information to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the duration of her candidacy for president because of the FBIs findings. The letter was obtained by Reuters from a source familiar with the matter. Ryan, a Republican vice presidential candidate in 2012, said he was aware Clinton would begin receiving classified intelligence briefings after the Democratic National Convention if she is formally nominated as expected. Presidential candidates are customarily provided such briefings. Given the FBIs findings, denying Secretary Clinton access to classified information certainly constitutes appropriate sanctions, Ryan said in the letter. Republican senators, including former Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio, said in their letter to Kerry that it was clear from Comeys comments on Tuesday that Clinton and her aides should have their security clearances immediately suspended if they still have them. There is simply no excuse for Hillary Clintons decision to set up a home-cooked email system which left sensitive and classified national security information vulnerable to theft and exploitation by Americas enemies, the letter said.

"U.S. attorney general closes Clinton email probe, says no charges","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The investigation into Hillary Clintons use of private email while secretary of state is closed, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Wednesday, removing a legal cloud that threatened the presumptive Democratic nominees presidential bid.   Lynch said she accepted the Federal Bureau of Investigations recommendations that no charges be brought in the probe, as Republicans made clear they would not let Clintons email headaches fade away easily. I received and accepted their unanimous recommendation that the thorough, year-long investigation be closed and that no charges be brought against any individuals within the scope of the investigation, Lynch said in a statement. With the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential and congressional elections beginning to heat up, Republicans called on the administration to make public key documents in the Clinton email case. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, speaking at a campaign rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, accused Clinton, his likely Democratic opponent, of bribing Lynch to decide not to press charges. He was referring to reports, including in the New York Times  this week, that Clinton, if elected president, might ask Lynch to stay on as attorney general. She said shes going to reappoint the attorney general and the attorney general is waiting to make a determination as to whether or not shes guilty. And boy was that a fast determination, wow, Trump said, adding, Thats bribery folks. On Capitol Hill, Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 3 House of Representatives Republican, reacted to Lynchs announcement by proclaiming: Secretary Clinton broke the law and lied about it. Senior Senate Republicans insisted that the FBIs investigation be made available to the public, including a transcript of the more than three hours Clinton spent last Saturday in an interview conducted by the agency. Shortly before Lynchs announcement, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters, I think the next step...is to compare what Hillary Clinton said to the FBI with what Hillary Clintons been saying to all of us over the last couple of years during this controversy. In a blistering attack on Clinton, John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican, said on the Senate floor: The bottom line is Secretary Clinton actively sought out ways to hide her actions as much as possible by using a private email account while heading the State Department. And in so doing, she put our country at risk by leaving those emails vulnerable to computer hackers. Democrats have questioned Republicans motives and accused them of squandering taxpayer dollars with lengthy investigations that have failed to uncover illegal activities. Republicans are in such desperate shape because of Trump (that) they would seize upon anything to divert attention, said Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid. And Senator Patrick Leahy, the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement following Lynchs announcement: This investigation is closed and that should be the end of this matter. On Tuesday, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, had been extremely careless in her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, but he recommended no criminal charges be filed in the case. Comey, who was deputy attorney general during the George W. Bush administration before becoming FBI director in 2013, is scheduled to testify on Thursday before a House committee, where Republicans and Democrats are expected to press him on his findings in the Clinton case. Lynch said she met on Wednesday afternoon with Comey and the career prosecutors and agents who had investigated whether Clinton broke the law as result of email servers kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home. One question is whether she mishandled classified information. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, said on Wednesday it appeared Clinton received preferential treatment from the FBI. Asked whether a special prosecutor should be named to investigate the matter, Ryan said the House would not foreclose any options. But Ryan did say that because of her messy handling of emails while serving as secretary of state, Clinton should be denied access to classified information during the campaign. Presidential candidates normally get such briefings once they are formally nominated. McConnell, Ryans Senate counterpart, stopped short of calling for such action. Clintons campaign was anxious to move on after Comeys announcement, saying in a statement on Tuesday it was pleased with the FBI decision. ",politicsNews,"July 6, 2016 ",1
Democrat Clinton to propose plan to protect small businesses,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Thursday will unveil proposals to help small businesses fight fraudulent practices by larger firms, tactics her campaign will compare to the business record of her Republican rival, Donald Trump.   The plan would enhance legal protections for small businesses when large firms dont pay their bills, increase federal regulatory enforcement, and expand working capital for small businesses, according to a Clinton official. The proposal comes a day after Clinton, in Atlantic City, lambasted Trump for what she described as profiting from exploiting workers in the slumping seaside town. A Reuters special report last year found Trump sometimes refuses to pay bills from contractors he has hired and then forces them to negotiate the final figure down. The new plan from the former secretary of state highlights a major division in the Democratic and Republican campaigns for the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Trump, a New York real estate developer, often highlights his businesses as among his biggest qualifications for office, promising to do for the country what he says he has done for his companies.  But Clinton and others have harshly criticized Trumps business practices and argue that running a country is a far different proposition from running a private enterprise.  Clinton and several campaign surrogates will take her new small business proposal to 10 states, including key election battlegrounds of Florida and Nevada, pointing to Donald Trumps Atlantic City casino bankruptcies as a warning sign for voters.

"Trump rejects criticism, vents at news media in campaign speech","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday rejected criticism of his campaign tactics, in a wide-ranging speech defending his teams use of a Jewish star and his own praise of the late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. At a campaign rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, Trump vented his frustration at a news media he feels is out to derail his candidacy and help Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, deriding CNN, in particular, as the Clinton News Network. Trumps hour-long performance was unlikely to reassure those Republicans who would like to see the New York businessman focus his message on attacking Clinton to rally the party behind him at the Cleveland convention from July 18 to 21 where he is to be formally nominated. He was particularly animated in defending his campaigns use of what was seen to be a Jewish star in a tweet last week that described Clinton as corrupt. The star was replaced with a round emblem after the criticism, but the incident has generated days of controversy. Trump said he thought the star was more the shape of a sheriffs badge. He described as sick people those in the news media who called it a Jewish Star of David. Later, Trump tweeted an image of character from a book linked to Disneys movie, Frozen, that used a similarly shaped star on its cover. Where is the outrage for this Disney book? Is this the Star of David also? Dishonest media! #Frozen, he tweeted. In his Ohio speech, Trump also returned to the subject of Saddam after generating controversy on Tuesday by complimenting him for his handling of militants. Irritated by the criticism, Trump brought up Saddam again. So I said bad guy, really bad guy, but he was good at one thing: Killing terrorists I dont love Saddam Hussein. I hate Saddam Hussein. But he was damned good at killing terrorists, Trump said. Trump also reacted to a mosquito that buzzed near his hand at the podium. I dont like mosquitoes, I never did. Speaking of mosquitoes, hello Hillary, how are you doing? he said. ",politicsNews,"July 7, 2016 ",1
"Donald Trump, Republican Party boost fundraising in June","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee raised nearly $51 million for his presidential campaign in June, after he launched his first aggressive effort at raising cash, Trumps organization reported on Wednesday. The most recent haul dwarfed the $3.1 million the Trump campaign raised in May. That low number prompted widespread concern among Republicans that the New York businessman, a newcomer to politics who largely bankrolled his primary campaign, would be unable to compete with Democrat Hillary Clintons massive fundraising operation. For June, fundraising emails circulated by the Trump campaign attracted $26 million, in addition to more than $25 million raised in conjunction with the RNC through joint fundraising events in June and the last week of May. The joint funds are intended to help both Trump and candidates in other races, such as people running for Congress, in the Nov. 8 election. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, personally contributed $3.8 million in June, the campaign said, bringing the total contributions for the month to about $55 million. We just started our fundraising efforts in the last week of May and we are extremely pleased with the broad-based support in the last five weeks for the Trump Campaign and Trump Victory, the campaign said in a statement. In June, Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, raised $68.5 million, including $40 million for her campaign and $28 million for the DNC and state victory funds. She began July with $44 million in cash on hand. While Trumps June total far eclipsed the candidates past hauls, Lisa Spies, a Republican fundraiser who worked for Mitt Romney in 2012 and raised money for Jeb Bush in the 2016 primary, said the dollar count was much lower than the $106 million that Romney, the partys standard-bearer in 2012, brought in during the same month four years ago. This is his low-hanging fruit, and its good, Im not putting it down. But it needs to get much better than this quickly. Hes playing a game of catch-up right now, Spies said. Clintons fundraising advantage has allowed her to build a vastly larger campaign infrastructure. Clinton already has extensive staff operations in the most important battleground states and has begun to run paid advertising. Trump has only a handful of staffers and has made no large television ad purchases. Trump beat 16 rivals in the Republican presidential race, but his free-wheeling style and some of his campaign pledges, such as his plan to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, have long worried some in the party establishment and he has struggled to unify Republicans behind him.  The Super PACs supporting Trump, which are permitted to raise and spend unlimited sums but are not allowed to coordinate directly with the campaign, have also struggled to get organized. While there was once a constellation of more than a dozen Super PACs backing him, most of his support has consolidated around Great America PAC, which is being run by veteran political operative Ed Rollins. The PAC is on target to raise $10 million before the July 18 start of the Republican National Convention, said Eric Beach, a top PAC official. They have already seen an uptick in fundraising, bringing in $5 million in June, doubling the May haul of $2.5 million. Great America PAC is using that money to run television ads, and plans to attack Clinton over her use of personal email servers during her time as secretary of state. The Super PAC supporting Clinton, Priorities USA, had raised $88 million by the end of May and had $51 million to spend. The group is already running ads attacking Trump. Trump got off to a slow start in fundraising, funding much of his primary campaign with his personal wealth in loans that totaled about $50 million. He announced last month he would forgive the loans to his campaign, intending to signal to potential donors that he would not use their funds to repay himself. He held his first fundraiser in late May and had several in June, including a high-dollar event in New York City and several fundraisers in Texas. Trump continues to promise to make contributions to his own campaign. In June, he launched an online fundraising effort by promising to match donations up to $2 million. Trump and Clinton both use joint fundraising agreements with their respective parties. The agreements allow the candidates to accept checks larger than the $5,400 limit that an individual can give to a campaign. Instead, the larger donations are divided up among the campaign, the national party and various state victory funds. All the money is then used to help elect the presidential candidate as well as other candidates. The campaigns and the political parties are permitted to coordinate how they spend that money.

U.S. Republicans reject Democratic funding proposals for opioids,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers in U.S. Congress on Wednesday rejected two Democratic amendments to provide nearly $1 billion in funding for bipartisan legislation intended to combat Americas opioid epidemic, aides said. The rejection, which came during a meeting of U.S. House of Representatives and Senate negotiators on the measure, could undermine Democratic support for final legislation that could come up for a vote in the House of Representatives as early as Friday. The House and Senate each passed its own versions of the legislation in the last few months. House and Senate Democratic lawmakers are now withholding their support for the final version of the bill, according to two Democratic aides. Democratic opposition could prove to be an obstacle, especially in the Senate, where lawmakers need 60 votes to move legislation forward.  Two amendments, from House and Senate Democrats, would have provided $920 million up front to finance program grants for states. Aides said the programs otherwise require completion of a lengthy appropriations process that could stall in a congressional session shortened by this years election campaign. Republican aides were not immediately available for comment. But House Republicans are separately considering a health spending measure that would provide more than $581 million to address opioid abuse. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra said on Wednesday it was only the latest instance in which legislation with bipartisan backing fell short on funding. Its becoming a bit of a joke to say were concerned and want to do something, when the only thing well do is shell of what it actually takes, he said. ",politicsNews,"July 6, 2016 ",1
Two leading Republicans shy away from being Trump's VP pick,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trumps list of potential vice presidential running mates got a little shorter on Wednesday when one prominent U.S. senator withdrew from consideration and a second said she wanted to focus on her home state. The moves by Bob Corker of Tennessee and Joni Ernst of Iowa could complicate Trumps efforts to rally establishment Republicans behind his presidential bid. With Trump looking at a self-imposed deadline of July 15 to announce his pick, there was no indication that the wealthy businessman was anywhere close to reaching what is perhaps the most important decision he will make as the presumptive Republican nominee. Trump is looking to announce his running mate just ahead of the Republican National Convention, to be held July 18-21  in Cleveland, where he is expected to become the partys official nominee. In Cincinnati, Ohio, on Wednesday, Trump campaigned with potential vice presidential candidate Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House of Representatives who is popular in conservative circles. Introducing Trump, Gingrich tried out the role of the No. 2 with a robust attack on presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for her email practices, on the same day the Justice Department decided not to levy criminal charges over what the Federal Bureau of Investigation called her extremely careless handling of classified information when she was secretary of state. There are two Americas. Theres the corrupt Washington of the old order. And theres all the rest of us. I say to you, Enough! Gingrich said. Trump liked what he heard. Im not saying its Newt, but if its Newt, nobody is going to be beating him in those debates, Trump said.  Trump told Fox News he has 10 candidates on his vice presidential list, including two generals. One source said Indiana Governor Mike Pence is being pushed internally by some members of Trumps inner circle. A former congressman, Pence met with Trump on Saturday. Corker, from Tennessee, who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had wrestled privately over whether to be a contender for the No. 2 position, telling friends he had never been a surrogate for another politician. Corker spent eight hours at Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday, then campaigned with Trump in Raleigh, North Carolina. He told reporters he withdrew because I just felt like I was far more suited for other types of service. You know, its a highly political role for the next four months, he said. I view myself as deep in substance and policy, and I just think there are better ways for me to serve in the public arena. His withdrawal eliminates an important party establishment figure as Trump tries to broaden his appeal with plans to visit Republicans in the Senate and House on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Corkers withdrawal could be considered a canary in the coal mine with establishment Republicans who are convinced that Trump cannot stay on message and cant stay focused on attacking Hillary Clinton without doing some type of damage to his campaign, said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. Some Republicans felt Trump erred by not taking full political advantage of FBI Director James Comeys statement on Tuesday that Clinton mishandled classified emails. In Raleigh, Trump sharply attacked Clinton but strayed from the message by saying the late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had done a good job cracking down on militants. Ernst, a rising figure in the Republican Party, spent part of the Fourth of July holiday on Monday meeting with Trump. She seemed to be leaning against the vice presidential position, and told Politico, I made that very clear to him that Im focused on Iowa. I feel that I have a lot more to do in the United States Senate. And Iowa is where my heart is. ",politicsNews,"July 6, 2016 ",1
"After FBI report, Clinton aides could find it harder to get security clearances","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBIs harsh criticism of Hillary Clintons use of a private email system as U.S. secretary of state could make it difficult for some of her closest aides to keep or renew government security clearances, but it would not affect Clinton herself if she is elected president, experts said. Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said on Tuesday an FBI investigation had found evidence that Clinton, now the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, and her aides were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information at the State Department.  Comey said he would not recommend that the Justice Department bring criminal charges - a recommendation accepted by Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Wednesday - but the FBI director noted that people found to have been similarly careless often face consequences in the form of security or administrative sanctions.  Most administrative sanctions, anything from a reprimand to a dismissal, cant be imposed on Clinton and three of her closest aides Cheryl Mills, Jake Sullivan and Huma Abedin as they have already left government, experts of the governments classified information regime said. But legal experts said that if Clinton aides were found to have treated classified material with extreme carelessness that could give the government reason to consider denying them a security clearance in the future or suspending or revoking one they may currently have.  If the system is fair and equitable, then they should all have difficulty maintaining or obtaining a security clearance in the future, said Mark Zaid, a Washington D.C.-based attorney who specializes in national security matters. Steven Aftergood, a Federation of American Scientists expert on national security and classification policy, noted, however, that Comey had highlighted what he called a problematic security culture at the State Department. So it might be hard to penalize individuals for this episode if their entire agency embraced similar practices, Aftergood said.  A Justice Department spokesperson declined to elaborate on Comeys statement, which did not name any of the aides. The Clinton campaign did not respond to questions about the security clearances of Clinton, Mills, Sullivan and Abedin, nor did lawyers for the three aides.  Abedin, who has been a personal aide to Clinton for about 20 years, and Sullivan, Clintons policy director at the State Department, sent information the government now says is classified to Clintons unauthorized private email account, according to email records released by the State Department. It remains unclear if they sent any of the 110 emails that Comey said contained information that was classified at the time they were written. The only author of such emails he identified was Clinton herself. A small number of other department colleagues sent  information the government has since marked as classified to Clintons account less frequently, the records show. The government forbids handling classified government secrets outside secured channels it controls. Clinton has said she did not knowingly send or receive classified information through her private email server. Both Abedin and Sullivan now hold senior roles in Clintons presidential campaign and are widely expected to join a Clinton administration if she is elected on Nov. 8.  Mills, who also passed along information the government now deems classified, has continued to work as a lawyer for Clinton but has no formal role in the campaign. It unclear if she will seek a role in a Clinton administration. Some presidential appointments require Senate confirmation, and lawmakers could use any past criticism of an aides handling of government secrets as a reason to block their appointment to a Senate-confirmed job, said William J. Leonard, a former director of the federal governments Information Security Oversight Office. The State Department declined to discuss individual cases and said that as a matter of policy it does not publicly disclose who has a security clearance. But it said it can apply security sanctions, such as putting a black mark on a persons permanent personnel file that would come up in future background checks, even against former employees. For those former officials who maintain an active security clearance, they could lose it. Department policy is to maintain files on personnel who are found to have mishandled information to guide current and potential future decisions about employment and security clearances, John Kirby, a department spokesman, said in a statement.  Without knowing precisely what the FBI found about the actions of specific Clinton aides, it is impossible to say what  effect there may be on their current or future security clearances. Paul Ryan, the House Speaker and the most senior elected Republican official, said on Wednesday that Clinton should be denied the security clearance required to receive the customary intelligence briefing that government officials give to presidential nominees before the election. Presidents and other elected national officeholders are not required to have background checks to receive government secrets, according to experts and the Central Intelligence Agency. It would roil our system of representative democracy if a security official could say that the president ... cant have a security clearance, said McAdoo Gordon, an attorney with extensive experience in security clearance matters.

Clinton visits Atlantic City boardwalk to hit Trump on casino bankruptcies,"ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton visited the famous boardwalk in Atlantic City on Wednesday to highlight Republican rival Donald Trumps casino bankruptcies, warning he would bring the same cutthroat approach to managing the U.S. economy. Clinton, standing next to the shuttered Trump Plaza casino that Trump once owned, said the real estate developer routinely profited from the financial ruin of workers in the economically depressed seaside resort town. The people hes trying to convince to vote for him are the same people hes been exploiting for years - working people, small-business people, Clinton said. Clinton said Trumps casino bankruptcies and numerous complaints against him by contractors showed he cannot be trusted to set economic policy from the White House. He makes over-the-top promises and says if people trust in him, put their faith in him, hell deliver, she said. Then everything falls apart, people get hurt, and Donald gets paid. The Trump Plaza was one of four casinos Trump once owned in Atlantic City. He left the city after his last bankruptcy. Clinton frequently uses criticism of Trumps business record to illustrate a principle campaign theme - that the wealthy New Yorker is only interested in boosting his financial bottom line, and not concerned about the economic struggles of working Americans. Clinton reminded supporters who gathered on the boardwalk under a boiling sun, within steps of the citys beach, that Trump had promised to do for the country what I did for my business. She said Trump intentionally ran up hundreds of millions of debt on his companies, borrowed at high rates, defaulted on the loans, and left in the lurch the workers and contractors who relied on his casinos for income. That says everything you need to know about Donald Trump, Clinton said. Its not about what he can build. Its about how much he can take. Atlantic City has struggled economically in recent years as a series of casinos have closed. The citys 10 percent unemployment rate is nearly double the national average, and closed buildings pockmark its boardwalk. In an emailed statement, Trump defended his bankruptcy filings on casinos and other projects as a commonly used practice to restructure a business and ultimately save jobs. I created thousands of jobs and made a lot of money in Atlantic City, which was what, as a businessman, I am supposed to do for my company and my family  and as President I will make America rich again, he said. Nobody understands the economy like I do and no one, especially not Crooked Hillary Clinton, will do more for the economy than I will.  After the speech, Clinton drove a few blocks to shake hands with dozens of striking workers outside the Trump Taj Mahal, another of the casinos that Trump once owned. Her attack on Trumps business dealings came as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee blasted her integrity following an FBI report that criticized her use of private email during her tenure as secretary of state. Clinton did not address the email issue during her stop in Atlantic City. On Tuesday, FBI Director James Comey said the agency would recommend no criminal charges against Clinton for her use of private email servers. But Comey rebuked her for what he said was extremely careless handling of classified material on her email servers, and contradicted her claims that she never transmitted or received classified material on that email system. Republican lawmakers criticized Comey for what they saw as lax treatment of Clinton, and on Wednesday, committee chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Republican, announced that Comey will testify before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Thursday to explain the bureaus surprising and confusing recommendation. The FBI has been investigating whether Clinton broke the law as result of personal email servers kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, including whether she mishandled classified information on the servers.

Clinton campaign to focus on key states in election: memo,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clintons campaign laid out states critical to the U.S. presidential election in a memo to supporters dated Wednesday, including six with key minority populations - Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida, Colorado and Nevada. The memo, sent to interested parties from Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, also set a goal of raking in $4 million a day between now and the Nov. 8 election, or around $500 million total. The memo, which was shared with Reuters by a Clinton supporter, emphasized the importance of boosting turnout among minority voters in the race against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. If we fail to turn out African-American voters in Ohio, North Carolina or Virginia, we will lose. If we fail to turn out Hispanic voters in Florida, Colorado or Nevada, we will lose, Mook wrote.  If we fail to turn out Asian-American and Pacific Islander voters in Nevada or Virginia, we will lose. Plain and simple, he added. The memo emphasized the need for the most aggressive Get-Out-The-Vote (GOTV) program in history across the country and named other states, such as Pennsylvania and Ohio, as key to the campaigns efforts. The campaign declined to comment. Clintons lead over Trump widened to 13 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday. The poll showed 46 percent of likely voters supporting Clinton, with 33 percent backing Trump. But 22 percent said they would not support either candidate. That support is lopsided among different racial and ethnic groups. Among the smaller sample of black voters, for example, Clinton has a whopping 80 percent support, while with white voters the two candidates are just about even, according to the poll.

Sanders endorsement of Clinton could come as early as next week: ABC News,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presumptive presidential nominee Hillary Clinton could receive her rival Bernie Sanders endorsement at a public event next week, ABC News reported on Wednesday, citing unnamed sources close to the Sanders campaign. The two campaigns are discussing the matter and Sanders endorsement of Clinton could come sometime next week, possibly at an event in New Hampshire, ABC News said. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who describes himself as a democratic socialist, said last month he would vote for the former secretary of state in the Nov. 8 election to stop likely Republican nominee Donald Trump. But he has not quit the race and has said he will continue to push for a liberal agenda heading into the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia from July 25 to 28, when Clintons nomination is expected to become official.

U.S. lawmakers to debate measures to block Boeing aircraft sale to Iran,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives panel will debate legislation on Thursday intended to block Boeing Cos planned sale of dozens of commercial aircraft to Iran, which could also affect other planemakers, including Airbus if they became law. A Financial Services subcommittee will debate three measures, including one that would prohibit the U.S. Treasury from licensing the sale announced last month. Another would bar the Treasury secretary for authorizing transactions by U.S. financial institutions connected to the export of aircraft. A third measure would bar the Export-Import Bank from financing involving any entity that does business with Iran or provides financing to another entity to facilitate transactions with Iran. I am extremely concerned that by relaxing the rules, the Obama administration has allowed U.S. companies to be complicit in weaponizing the Iranian regime, Representative Bill Huizenga, chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee, said in a statement on Wednesday. If the bills became law, they would affect other firms sales to Iran because virtually all modern jets have more than 10 percent U.S. content, the threshold for requiring export licenses. A House committee aide said the full financial services committee was likely to approve the bills, but a vote had not yet been scheduled. However, the measures showed the extent of concern by Republicans, who control majorities in both the House and Senate, about the Iran deal and the potential Boeing sale. Democrats, including President Barack Obama, are expected to oppose the legislation. While most congressional Democrats backed the Iran deal announced a year ago, every Republican U.S. lawmaker opposed the pact in which the United States and international partners agreed to ease crippling economic sanctions in exchange for Tehran curtailing its nuclear program. When news of the Boeing deal emerged, several Republicans in Congress worried that it could threaten U.S. national security. Asked about those concerns last month, a Boeing executive noted last month that the Obama administration considered implementation of the nuclear pact critical to national security. A memorandum of agreement (MOA) calls for IranAir to buy a total of 80 aircraft from Boeing and lease a further 29 with Boeings support. Deliveries of the purchased jets are scheduled to start in 2017 and run through 2025. An Iranian official told Reuters some officials in Tehran are concerned about the legislation, arguing that if such measures become law they could endanger implementation of the nuclear deal by intensifying pressure on Iran President Hassan Rouhani to take a harder line in his dealings with the United States and its allies.

Ryan says Congress considering action on Clinton's email use,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday said lawmakers are examining whether there is any action they can take over Hillary Clintons email practices while secretary of state, saying it appeared she had received preferential treatment from the FBI. Ryan, a Republican, said the House of Representatives would not foreclose any options when asked whether a special prosecutor was necessary to get to the bottom of the Democratic presidential candidates use of a private email server while she ran the State Department. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Tuesday it would not recommend charges regarding Clintons email, although FBI Director James Comey rebuked the Democratic U.S. presidential candidate for extremely careless handling of classified information.  The FBI decision, Ryan said, looks like preferential treatment for Clinton. Ryan, who was the Republican vice presidential candidate in 2012, said Director of National Intelligence James Clapper should deny Clinton access to classified information during the campaign, although presidential candidates normally get such access once they are formally nominated. Clintons campaign, responding to Ryans remarks, said House Republicans appeared to be trying to launch another sham of an inquiry against Clinton now that they had ended their two-year probe of the deaths of four Americans at a U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi while Clinton was secretary of state. For weeks Republicans have said they trusted FBI Director Comey to lead an independent review into Secretary Clintons emails, but now they are second-guessing his judgment because his findings do not align with their conspiracy theories, campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said in an emailed statement. The campaign said on Tuesday it was pleased with the FBIs decision, noting that the candidate has said repeatedly that it was a mistake to use her personal email while secretary of state. Ryan noted that two House committees are looking into the Clinton email matter  the Judiciary committee and the Oversight Committee, where Comey has been invited to testify on Thursday. He (Comey) did say that short of prosecution, some kind of administrative action might be in order, Ryan said, adding: I think its the least we can do, given how she was so reckless in handling classified material and sending classified information on insecure servers. So look, I think thats something that the administration should do on its own, but well look into seeing if thats something we can do as well, Ryan said. Senate Republican leaders said they thought Clintons testimony to the FBI should be released to the public. But Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid dismissed as political the Republican calls for Clinton to stop getting classified information. The Republicans are in such desperate shape because of (Republican presidential candidate Donald) Trump, they would seize upon anything, Reid told reporters. He said the FBI investigation had been thorough. Its over and its time to move on. ",politicsNews,"July 6, 2016 ",1
John Kerry commits more U.S. military aid for ex-Soviet Georgia,"TBILISI (Reuters) - Secretary of State John Kerry told ex-Soviet Georgia that the United States would help it bolster its army as he reassured a close U.S. ally days before a NATO summit expected to focus on the threat a resurgent Russia poses. Kerry, on his first visit to Georgia as Secretary of State, made the commitment ahead of a NATO summit in Warsaw on Friday at which members of the Western military alliance plan to announce action to deter possible Russian military aggression. Georgia and former Soviet states such as Moldova and Ukraine have become increasingly concerned by Russias intentions after the Kremlin annexed Ukraines Crimea in 2014 and launched air strikes in Syria last year. Moscow says such fears are unfounded and based on what it calls anti-Russian hysteria.   In a memorandum of understanding signed on Wednesday by Kerry and Georgian Prime Minister Georgy Kvirikashvili, the United States promised to bolster Georgias ability to defend itself against potential threats. That meant greater military and security cooperation, enhanced information sharing, and help building up defense capacity, such as improving combat readiness and supporting defense procurement, the document said. Until now, U.S. security support has focused on training Georgian troops for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The United States stands firm in its commitment to Georgias sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, Kerry told reporters. Georgia, which is crisscrossed by strategically important oil and gas pipelines, fought and lost a short war with Russia in 2008. Moscow then recognized two breakaway pro-Kremlin Georgian regions - South Ossetia and Abkhazia - as independent countries, though most other countries have not. Russias occupation and militarization of parts of Georgias territory are unacceptable, said Kerry. We continue to call on Russia to fulfill its obligations under the 2008 ceasefire agreement, including a withdrawal of its forces to pre-conflict positions. Moscow for its part has accused the West, notably Washington, of stirring anti-Russian feelings in former Soviet states it deems part of its own sphere of influence. Kerry visits Ukraine next, on Thursday, before heading to Warsaw to join U.S. President Barack Obama for the NATO summit. In Ukraine, Kerrys third visit there since Russia annexed Crimea, he will focus on the implementation of the Minsk peace accords and the countrys reform agenda. It will be Kerrys first chance to meet new Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman. ",politicsNews,"July 6, 2016 ",1
U.S. House Republicans battle each other on gun control,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A divided Republican Party on Wednesday fought over gun control legislation that was cobbled together following last months mass shooting in Orlando, raising questions over U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryans ability to get the measure passed. While Democrats have said the gun control proposal put forward by Republican leaders was too weak, an influential group of approximately 40 conservative House Republicans announced their opposition as well, saying the plan did not do enough to protect gun buyers. The legislation fails to do enough to address the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, according to a statement by the conservative Freedom Caucus. The group also complained of the inclusion of gun control provisions that fail to adequately protect due process. With the Republican leaderships legislation under attack from both liberals and conservatives, it was unclear whether Ryan could muster the 218 votes he would need for passage in the House of Representatives. Last month, the Senate failed to approve any of several competing Republican and Democratic gun control proposals offered in the wake of the June 12 shooting at a gay night club in Orlando that killed 49 and injured 53 others. During the Senate debate, Democratic lawmakers staged a sit-in on the House floor to pressure Republican leaders to pass legislation expanding background checks on gun sales and blocking gun purchases by people on terrorism watch lists. The Republican leadership bill, announced last Friday, would give the government three days to convince a judge that a gun sale should be blocked. Ryan said Wednesday that he intended to bring it to the floor for a vote this week or next, but also noted changes were being sought by numerous lawmakers. The last thing were going to do is rush something to the floor that we dont have right, Ryan said. Representative Matt Salmon of Arizona, a Freedom Caucus member, said he objected to Ryan pushing the bill without allowing it to be processed by relevant committees first. Salmon said that Ryan told House Republicans in a closed meeting that he was rushing the legislation to the House floor because there are members that need to have this vote for political reasons in swing districts that could go either Republican or Democratic in the Nov. 8 elections. Democrats, meanwhile, continued to pressure Ryan for votes on their more sweeping gun control measures. Representative John Larson of Connecticut, a ringleader of the Democrats sit-in, said his fellow Democrats plan to support Republican mental health legislation that could help avert some mass shootings. Larson added he hoped it would be seen as an olive branch to Republicans toward progress on gun control. Scores of gun control advocates demonstrated outside the House chamber in sweltering heat on Wednesday morning, as 91 people wearing orange t-shirts stood on the steps leading to the House demanding action. They represented the 91 people who, according to government statistics, die each day in the United States from gun violence. Many of them die as a result of suicide. ",politicsNews,"July 6, 2016 ",1
"Clinton offers plan to freeze some college debt, cut tuition","(Reuters) - Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton on Wednesday proposed a temporary freeze on some student debt and the cutting of college tuition entirely for some families, focusing on an issue important to supporters of her rival Bernie Sanders. Clintons latest proposal includes a three-month moratorium for federal student loan payments and a new measure to eliminate in-state college tuition for families whose income does not exceed $125,000, according to a release from her campaign. The proposal builds on her earlier plan for easing student debt loads for higher education. Clinton, the former secretary of state and presumptive Democratic Party nominee, is looking to win over supporters of Sanders, the Vermont senator who was her main opponent for the nomination as he consistently sought to push the party left. The presumptive Republican nominee, businessman Donald Trump, also has courted Sanders voters, trying to use his outsider appeal to bring them over to his campaign. On Wednesday, Clinton proposed using executive action to offer a three-month moratorium on student loan payments to all federal loan borrowers to offer help for borrowers to consolidate loans and find other methods to reduce their payments.  She previously has released proposals to increase access to tuition grants, push for income-based repayments, and - like Sanders - to allow graduates to refinance student loans at lower interest rates. Sanders praised the new Clinton measures on Wednesday, saying in a statement that he wanted to take this opportunity to applaud Secretary Clinton. ",politicsNews,"July 6, 2016 ",1
Senior Republicans signal issues in Congress for Obama Afghan plan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Representative Mac Thornberry, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said on Wednesday that the White House must submit a supplemental funding request immediately to support President Barack Obamas plans to keep 8,400 troops in Afghanistan. Senator John McCain, who leads the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he welcomed Obamas decision but added in a statement: That said, when the President himself describes the security situation in Afghanistan as precarious, it is difficult to discern any strategic rationale for withdrawing 1,400 U.S. troops by the end of the year.

"Obama, in shift, says he will keep 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan until 2017","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama, calling Afghanistans security situation precarious, said on Wednesday he will keep U.S. troop levels there at 8,400 through the end of his administration rather than reducing them to 5,500 by years end as previously planned. Obama, in a statement at the White House, said the role of U.S. forces in Afghanistan will remain unchanged: training and advising Afghan police and troops, and supporting counterterrorism missions against the Taliban and other groups. Obamas presidency ends in January. Obamas plan still calls for a reduction in U.S. troop levels from the current roughly 9,800, but not as much as previously planned. Obama, who took office in 2009 pledging to wind down the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, said he had ended Americas combat mission in Afghanistan. But he acknowledged that security concerns persist. The security situation in Afghanistan remains precarious, Obama said. The Taliban remains a threat. Theyve gained ground in some places. Taliban forces now hold more territory in Afghanistan than at any time since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion, according to recent United Nations estimates. The Islamic State group has also established a small presence in Afghanistan. Obamas decision, which came after a review submitted last month by the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Army General John Nicholson, drew some criticism inside and outside his administration. Some Pentagon officials said that it does nothing to address the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan. Its disappointing that the administration thinks that troop numbers are a substitute for a more comprehensive strategy, said a U.S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. This is neither the reduction that the White House seems to have wanted nor the current numbers that dont seem to be sufficient to deal with the security problem. Mac Thornberry, the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, criticized what he said was a new cap on U.S. troop levels. It is time that the president level with the American people about what it will really take to achieve our goals in Afghanistan, and how much it will cost, Thornberry said in a statement.  Obama spoke in advance of a NATO summit on Friday and Saturday in Warsaw, Poland, where alliance members are expected to confirm their support for the Kabul government. In addition to the U.S. forces, there are about 3,000 other international troops in Afghanistan. U.S. troops have been in Afghanistan since the 2001 invasion launched by Obamas predecessor, George W. Bush, that toppled the Taliban leaders who harbored the al Qaeda organization responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States that killed about 3,000 people. It is Americas longest war. During his announcement at the White House, Obama was flanked by Defense Secretary Ash Carter and the top U.S. military officer, General Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Rebuke of Clinton over email use creates opening for Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI report scolding Democrat Hillary Clinton over her email practices as secretary of state plays into a chief vulnerability that her rival, Republican Donald Trump, hopes to exploit  wariness among U.S. voters about her trustworthiness. Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said the Federal Bureau of Investigations recommendation against criminal charges for Clinton means the email matter is now resolved. Yet even as he removed the threat of charges against the Democratic candidate, FBI Director James Comey described Clintons handling of classified information as extremely careless. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, seized on that comment. Were talking about serious stuff, he told a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina. The laws are very explicit. The New York businessman has been struggling to unify the party around his candidacy, and Republicans say Trump could use the issue to heal some of the rifts within his party while motivating conservatives to go to the polls in the Nov. 8 election. Indeed, a main element of Trumps strategy for winning over Republicans who are lukewarm on his candidacy is to emphasize the importance of keeping Clinton out of the White House. Clinton won the Comey primary but Trump has the opportunity to drive home the lack of trust theme, said Republican strategist Scott Reed. A Reuters/Ipsos poll from May 1-11 found that a majority of American adults do not think Clinton is an honest person. This included 89 percent of Republicans, 72 percent of independents and 36 percent of Democrats. More than a quarter, 27 percent, of Clintons own supporters did not think she is an honest person, according to the poll. Democratic strategist Steve Elmendorf said Clinton needs to move quickly to get past the email episode and talk about issues central to her campaign. He predicted the issue will be short-lived as voters focus on the candidates vice presidential running mates, the nominating conventions and fall debates. She made a mistake here, theres no question about it, said Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist who was chief strategist for 2004 nominee John Kerry, the current secretary of state.  But theres also justice in what she says, that for 24 years the Republicans have relentlessly gone after Bill and Hillary Clinton. That has its impact and that impact you can see in her trust numbers. But this decision, despite how anybody spins, it not only helps her but in my view was indispensable to her, Shrum said. Hours after Comeys announcement, Trumps campaign sent an email soliciting money based on the Clinton email controversy.  The big question for Republicans is whether their presumptive presidential nominee will be able to prosecute the case effectively against Clinton since he is still at war with fellow Republicans and has little in the way of campaign funds to pay for TV ads against her. I dont think theres a way that Clinton can use this to raise anger at Republicans, said Andy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. But the Republicans can certainly use this to raise anger at Clinton and the Democrats. Anger is a great motivator to get people out to vote. Trumps initial response showed why Republicans continue to have concerns about him. Interviewed by Fox News Bill OReilly, Trump spent as much time criticizing Comey as he did Clinton. Comey is respected by Republicans and Democrats alike. I have such respect for the FBI that I just dont understand what happened here, Trump said. Everybody knows shes extremely guilty. And they really said she was guilty today and then they said were not going to prosecute. Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist and former spokesman for 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, called the FBI report a disqualifying event for Clinton. Trumps singular focus should be that she acted inappropriately. But Trump has a knack for distracting from Hillary Clintons scandals with his gaffes and missteps, he said. Trump has been fighting allegations of anti-Semitism in recent days over his campaigns use of a Jewish star in a tweet attacking Clinton as corrupt. ",politicsNews,"July 6, 2016 ",1
"Clinton 'extremely careless' with emails, but FBI recommends no charges","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI recommended on Tuesday that no criminal charges be filed over Hillary Clintons use of private email servers while she was secretary of state, but rebuked the Democratic U.S. presidential candidate for extremely careless handling of classified information. While FBI Director James Comeys announcement lifted a cloud of uncertainty that had loomed over Clintons White House campaign, his strong criticism of her judgment ignited a new attack on her over the email issue by Donald Trump, her likely Republican opponent in the Nov. 8 election. Comeys comments are likely to reinforce what polls show are widespread public concerns about Clintons honesty and trustworthiness. Republicans have pointed to the controversy as evidence that she considered herself above the law. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the highest- ranking elected U.S. Republican, said in a statement that Comeys announcement defies explanation. Ryan called on the FBI to release all of its findings in the case and said Comey would be called to testify before the House Oversight Committee. We need to know more, Ryan told Fox News.  In a lengthy statement on the Federal Bureau of Investigations conclusions from its yearlong investigation, Comey directly contradicted statements Clinton has made while defending her use of the private email setup. He said, for example, that the FBI found at least 110 emails that contained classified information when they were sent,  although Clinton has repeatedly said she never sent or received classified information on her private servers. Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of the classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information, Comey said. But he said the FBI concluded no reasonable prosecutor would bring charges. Although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case, Comey told reporters in Washington. His recommendation will likely stand. The countrys top prosecutor, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, said on Friday she would accept the recommendations of career prosecutors and the FBI director on whether to charge Clinton for mishandling emails. Clintons campaign was anxious to move on after Comeys announcement, saying in a statement it was pleased with the FBI decision. As the secretary has long said, it was a mistake to use her personal email, and she would not do it again. We are glad that this matter is now resolved, spokesman Brian Fallon said. He did not respond to questions about Comeys rebuttal of the main arguments Clinton has offered in defense of her use of private email. At a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Tuesday night, Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, said the controversy should disqualify Clinton from being president and that her email system may well have been hacked by U.S. enemies. Our enemies may have a blackmail file on crooked Hillary and this alone means that she should not be allowed to serve as president of the United States, Trump said. We now know that she lied to the country when she said that she did not send classified information on her server. She lied! Following Comeys late-morning remarks, Clinton became one of the top trending topics on Twitter, with about 671,000 tweets posted by 4 p.m. (2000 GMT). The overall sentiment was more negative than positive, with about two negative tweets for every positive one, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph. The FBI directors announcement came hours before Clintons first campaign appearance with President Barack Obama, in Charlotte, North Carolina, where neither Obama nor Clinton mentioned the email probe. It also came less than three weeks before the Democratic National Convention at which Clinton is to be nominated as the partys candidate for the November election. The FBI has been investigating whether Clinton broke the law as result of personal email servers kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. One question is whether she mishandled classified information on the servers. As the investigation wound up, Clinton underwent a voluntary 3-1/2-hour interview with the FBI on Saturday in Washington. Comey said the FBI did not find that Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate the law, and that there was no intentional misconduct by her lawyers who sorted her emails. He said her staff should have known Clintons private email was an improper place for classified information, but added there was no evidence anyone had hacked Clintons communications. Comey said, however, that hostile actors gained access to email accounts of people with whom Clinton corresponded  regularly. He also said she used email extensively while traveling in territory of sophisticated adversaries. Experts routinely advise U.S. government officials not to bring important digital information to countries with a track record of aggressive cyber activity. Clinton traveled to more than 100 countries during her four years as top U.S. diplomat, including trips to China and Russia, considered among the most sophisticated U.S. cyber adversaries. The FBI found 110 emails in 52 email chains that contained information that was classified at the time the messages were sent, Comey said. Eight of those chains contained top-secret information, the highest level of government classification for material that could harm national security. A further 36 email chains contained secret information, and eight confidential information, he said. Agents also found three classified emails among the thousands Clinton never returned to the State Department. Comey said there were no previous cases that supported filing criminal charges against Clinton. Other cases had involved intentional mishandling of information, he said. Last year, the FBI recommended that former CIA Director David Petraeus be charged with a felony for his mishandling of classified information with his biographer, with whom he was having an affair.  In that case, however, the FBI had evidence that Petraeus knew the information was highly classified. Petraeus eventually pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information. Republican lawmakers have called for an independent investigation of Clinton, saying they do not trust the Justice Department to handle the inquiry with impartiality. Republican criticism of the process heated up after Clintons husband, former President Bill Clinton, met privately with Lynch in Phoenix last week. Lynch, who was appointed by Obama, said later she regretted the meeting and that she and the former president did not discuss the investigation. ",politicsNews,"July 5, 2016 ",1
Lawyers: Legal precedent clears Clinton in email investigation,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In declining to seek prosecution of Hillary Clinton, FBI Director James Comey said the former Secretary of States handling of classified emails was extremely careless - conduct, legal experts said, that falls short of gross negligence, a standard for criminal charges under the Espionage Act. Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case, Comey said in a news conference Tuesday detailing the FBI investigation and his decision. Several legal experts agreed with Comeys conclusion that there was no recent precedent for bringing such a case without evidence of willful intent or gross negligence, and they said it would have been difficult to convince a jury to convict Clinton based on the evidence. Extreme carelessness doesnt necessarily translate into gross negligence, said Laurie Levenson, a professor of law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and former federal prosecutor.  The only times I have seen these statutes used has been situations in which people knew they were disclosing classified, confidential information, or they could show they didnt really care, Levenson said.  Comey said investigators determined that Clinton exchanged 110 emails that contained government secrets and that she and her staff should have known the information was classified. But unlike other cases prosecuted under the Espionage Act, the FBI has not suggested that Clintonintentionally sharedgovernment secrets with people not authorized to see them. The statute for charging gross negligence under the Espionage Act, written in 1917, requires the information be removed from its proper place, a tough legal requirement in the digital age, said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at University of Texas. Vladeck said the law is not well suited for careless discussion of information in unsecured media that doesnt dispossess the government of that information or direct it right into the hands of a foreign power.  Previous cases charged under the Espionage Act have shown intent, experts said. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell said Comeys decision was completely consistent with every case brought for leaking classified government information.  Defendants in other cases include Stephen Kim, Lowells client who pleaded guilty to leaking State Department documents to the press, as well as former C.I.A. Director General David Petraeus. He admitted to keeping classified information, which he would also share with his biographer, in his home, while telling the government he had returned all such information. The one common denominator of all such cases is that the individual involved intentionally sent material to those not authorized to receive it, like the press, like a foreign government, Lowell said. Comey said the FBI did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information. But he said it did find evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling a very sensitive, highly classified information. His recommendation, which Attorney General Loretta Lynch previously said she would accept, angered Republicans who said her actions should be punished.  Republican presidential front runner Donald Trump reacted to the news from his Twitter account, saying, The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. In that case, the FBI recommended a felony charge. But Attorney General Eric Holder pursued a misdemeanor under another part of the law, and Petraeus pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to two years probation in 2015.  The FBI had recordings of Petraeus acknowledging the information in notebooks in his home was highly classified. Petraeus also admitted to lying to the FBI about sharing the information with Paula Broadwell, his biographer and lover. Steven Aftergood, director of the Federation of American Scientists Project on Government Secrecy, said Clintons cooperation with FBI investigators also may have helped her avoid charges. There was no obstruction of justice, no failure to cooperate truthfully with investigators, no concealment of her activity, Aftergood said. Legal precedent suggests that Clinton is unlikely to face a misdemeanor charge for recklessness because recent cases that ended with misdemeanors began as much larger felony charges against individuals who intended to leak information. In 2010, Thomas Drake, a whistleblower from the NationalSecurity Agency who helped expose the governments warrantless surveillance of Americans, was charged with espionage after the government accused him of bringing five classified documents home. He denied the accusation, and those charges were dropped. Drake pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count for exceeding authorized use of a computer. Somebody needs to ask Comey about my case, Drake, who now works at an Apple store in Maryland, wrote in an email late Tuesday. Former president Bill Clintons national security adviser pleaded guilty in 2005 to smuggling classified documents out of the National Archives by stuffing them under his clothes. He was fined $50,000 and sentenced to two years of probation.  ",politicsNews,"July 6, 2016 ",1
U.S. Republicans push back on Democratic gun-control efforts,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. congressional Republicans on Tuesday resisted Democratic demands for a vote on gun-control measures and warned that some could face punishment for an unusual sit-in last month that tied up the House of Representatives for 25 hours. With Democrats already rejecting a Republican gun bill and warning of further protests, the Republican-controlled House appeared to be heading for renewed discord over gun restrictions following the June 12 mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. House Speaker Paul Ryan met for about 30 minutes on Tuesday with two Democrats who led the sit-in: Representatives John Lewis of Georgia and John Larson of Connecticut. The Democrats said they would ask Ryan for a vote on two Democratic-backed measures but left the meeting without speaking to reporters. The path ahead ... will be discussed and determined by the majority in the coming days, Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said later in a statement. The measures sought by Democrats would expand background checks for gun purchases and allow the government to block gun sales to suspected extremists without first getting a judges approval.   Hours before the meeting, Ryan suggested a vote on the Democratic legislation was unlikely, telling a Milwaukee radio station: The last thing we are going to do is surrender the floor over to these kinds of tactics when we know its going to compromise the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said separately that he and Ryan would meet this week with the chambers top enforcement official to talk about reports that some Democrats at the June 22-23 sit-in engaged in intimidation while carrying out their protest. Ryan has announced that the House will vote this week on a measure intended to keep guns out of the hands of people the government suspects of involvement in violent extremism. But Democrats say the legislation is inadequate because authorities would have only three days to convince a judge that a gun sale should be blocked. Ninety-one people die each day from gun violence in this country and the best Speaker Ryan can muster is a meaningless bill, said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi aide Drew Hammill. Six people who said they lost family and loved ones to gun violence were arrested in the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, after a protest demanding Congress reject the Ryan measure and vote on the Democratic measures.

Trump takes potential VP running mates for test drives,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump is taking some of his potential vice presidential running mates out for a test drive this week, meeting in private and trotting them out in public as he seeks to make his choice before the Republican National Convention less than two weeks away.  Republicans close to the campaign say Trump and his team are considering announcing his running mate pick next week ahead of the convention, to be held July 18-21 in Cleveland, to try to get maximum media buzz from the decision. As his aides vet the people on his short list, Trump is getting an up-close look at some of the candidates and talking about it publicly, dispensing with the usual tradition of keeping secret the process of choosing a running mate. Trump, who is to be formally nominated at the convention as the Republican candidate for the Nov. 8 election, met privately on Tuesday with one possible pick, U.S. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, at Trump Tower in New York. On Tuesday night, the two appeared together at a Trump rally in Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump introduced Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as a great friend of mine, somebody respected by everybody. Then it was Corkers turn.  Ive figured out the reason why you love him so much, the senator told the crowd. The reason you love him so much is because he loves you. He loves you and he wants the best for you.      On Wednesday, Trump is to be joined for an event in Cincinnati by Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives who is another possible pick by Trump for the No. 2 position. Gingrich has been a close Trump adviser and is well regarded at Trump Tower. On Monday, Trump met on Monday with U.S. Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, another candidate on his short list. Others on Trumps running mate list include Indiana Governor Mike Pence, who Trump met with on Saturday, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin and U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. Christie, a former Trump rival for the Republican nomination, and Sessions are among Trumps earliest supporters in the party and closest advisers. ",politicsNews,"July 5, 2016 ",1
Judge blocks Kansas' attempt to cut Planned Parenthood from Medicaid,"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday blocked Kansas Governor Sam Brownbacks efforts to remove Planned Parenthood, a U.S. womens healthcare and abortion provider, from a government health insurance program for the poor in the state. U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson issued the 54-page order for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, ruling the state could not cancel Medicaid provider agreements with Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri, or PPKM, and Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, or PPSLR. It is uncontroverted that PPKM and PPSLR serve hundreds of underprivileged women in the State of Kansas, Robinson said in the order. It is in the public interest to allow these individuals to be treated by the qualified provider of their choice, and to have that provider reimbursed under Medicaid pending a trial on the merits in this case. The Republican governor ordered state officials to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood and its affiliates through the state Medicaid program in January, saying the state would not fund an industry that disrespected life. A spokeswoman for Brownback said in a statement on Tuesday: The governor will continue the fight to make Kansas a pro-life state. We will review todays preliminary ruling and move forward with the litigation. The state sought to cut funding after the release of videos secretly recorded by an anti-abortion group that activists said showed that Planned Parenthood officials in some states had discussed the sale of aborted fetal tissue. Neither of the Planned Parenthood affiliates involved in the case participates in fetal tissue donation or sale, court records show. We are thrilled with the judges ruling. We felt strongly that we were going into this on the right side of the law, said Laura McQuade, chief executive of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, formerly Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri. The two organizations, along with three of their patients who are on Medicaid, sued the state in May, arguing Brownbacks order would break federal law and violate the U.S. Constitution. Planned Parenthood has denied taking any illegal payments, calling the videos distortions of fetal-tissue donations. The organization has said it has received only reimbursements for its costs, which are legal under U.S. law. Planned Parenthood said in May that at least two dozen states had cut or tried to slash funding to its clinics since the mid-2015 release of the undercover videos. ",politicsNews,"July 5, 2016 ",1
Clinton expands lead over Trump to 13 points: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton widened her lead over likely Republican nominee Donald Trump to 13 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday. The July 1-5 poll included responses gathered mostly over the holiday weekend, before the Federal Bureau of Investigation recommended on Tuesday that no criminal charges be filed against Clinton over her use of private email servers and what it called her extremely careless handling of classified information while she was U.S. secretary of state. The presumptive Democratic nominee led Trump, a New York businessman, by 9 percentage points in a previous Reuters/Ipsos poll that ran from June 27 to July 1. Tuesdays poll showed that 46 percent of likely voters supported Clinton, while 33 percent backed Trump. Twenty-two percent said they would not support either candidate for the  Nov. 8 election.  Throughout the campaign, Clinton has been dogged by her use of a personal email server during her years as the nations top diplomat. Over the past several months, she has handed over thousands of pages of emails to investigators and responded to a number of government inquiries.  Clinton has repeatedly said she never sent or received classified documents on her private servers, yet the public appears distrustful of her, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. In early May, 63 percent of Americans, including 36 percent of Democrats, said they did not believe Clinton was honest and truthful. But Clinton has led Trump most of the year among likely voters. Since mid-May, she has maintained a relatively consistent level of support among likely voters, while Trumps popularity has eroded as his campaign wrestled with a variety of issues.  Republican leaders distanced themselves from Trump after he suggested a federal judge was biased because of his Hispanic heritage and after he doubled down on a pledge to block Muslims from entering the country. On Tuesday, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan criticized a tweet posted by Trump over the weekend that many deemed to be anti-Semitic. Trumps level of support among likely voters was about 10 points below what 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney received in early July 2012. Among Clintons supporters, nearly half said they were backing her because I dont want Donald Trump to win. A further 39 percent said they agree with her positions, and about 13 percent said they like her personally.  The online national poll of 1,441 American adults had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"July 5, 2016 ",1
U.S. appeals court upholds conviction over shared password,"(Reuters) - A divided federal appeals court on Tuesday gave the U.S. Department of Justice broad leeway to police password theft under a 1984 anti-hacking law, upholding the conviction of a former Korn/Ferry International executive for stealing confidential client data. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said David Nosal violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 2005 when he and two friends, who had also left Korn/Ferry, used an employees password to access the recruiting firms computers and obtain information to help start a new firm. Writing for a 2-1 majority, Circuit Judge Margaret McKeown said Nosal acted without authorization even though the employee, his former secretary, had voluntarily provided her password. The defendant had by then been working as an independent contractor for Korn/Ferry. Nosal and his friends had previously had their own log-in credentials revoked. Nosals case has been closely watched by digital privacy groups worried that it could make it easier to prosecute people for ordinary password sharing, such as when a husband logs into his wifes Facebook account with her credentials and permission. The court is criminalizing conduct that ordinary Americans do every day online, Jamie Williams, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which supported overturning Nosals conviction, said in an interview. Dennis Riordan, a lawyer for Nosal, said in a statement he will ask an 11-judge appeals court panel to review the decision. A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment. Nosal had been appealing his April 2013 jury conviction and one-year prison sentence for violating the CFAA and for trade secret theft under the Economic Espionage Act. The appeals court on Tuesday upheld Nosals conviction under the EEA. It also ordered a recalculation of his $827,983 of restitution to Korn/Ferry to reconsider the legal fee component. Circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt dissented. He said the majoritys reasoning could cover the sharing of passwords to devices such as smartphones, laptops and iPads, and transform millions of people who engage in this ubiquitous, useful, and generally harmless conduct into unwitting federal criminals. McKeown, however, said this approach ignored reality and could enable criminals to escape prosecution after they found obliging employees willing to willy-nilly give out passwords. The appeals court had in April 2012 dismissed other counts accusing Nosal of CFAA violations. The case is U.S. v. Nosal, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-10037.

Factbox: FBI vs. Clinton - Seven points of contention,"(Reuters) - FBI Director James Comey undercut some of the main arguments Hillary Clinton has made in defense of her use of an unauthorized private email system while she was U.S. secretary of state.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation began investigating Clintons email system after government watchdogs found that some of her messages contained classified government secrets last year. Comey is recommending that Clinton not face criminal charges. But in an unusual step, he used a news conference to give a public rebuttal on Tuesday of the defenses offered by Clinton over the last year. Here are seven times that Comey contradicts Clinton: Clinton said: Clinton said in March 2015 that she returned anything that could be possibly viewed as work related. She later swore under oath that she returned all her work emails to the State Department in 2014, some 30,000 in all. Comey said: The FBI recovered several thousand work emails that were not returned to the State Department. Comey has reasonable confidence that there was no deliberate effort to withhold these messages.   Clinton said: Clinton has repeatedly said she did not send or receive any classified information through her private email system, and that emails being released to the public that were now marked classified were being retroactively upgraded. Comey said: The FBI found 110 emails in 52 email chains that contained information that was classified at the time the messages were sent. Eight of those chains contained Top Secret information, the highest level of government classification; another 36 chains contained Secret information, and eight contained confidential information. Clinton said: Clinton has repeatedly said she did not send or receive any emails that were marked classified. Comey said: A very small number of emails were marked as containing classified information. But even if information is not marked classified in an email, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it, Comey said. Clinton said:      The security and integrity of the email system were taken seriously, and robust protections were put in place, according to her staff in March 2015. Comey said: The system was not even supported by full-time security staff, like those found at departments and agencies of the U.S. government, or even with a commercial service like Gmail. Clinton said: Clinton said there is no evidence there was ever a breach of her email system. Comey said:  It would be unlikely to find direct evidence of Clintons email system being hacked, but the FBI believes it is possible that hostile actors gained access. Hostile actors also gained access to some people Clinton corresponded with on her email system. Clinton said: Im certainly well aware of the classification requirements, Clinton said in March 2015. Comey said: Clinton and her colleagues were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. Clinton said: Clinton has maintained that her email system was allowed and that she did nothing wrong. She has also said it was a mistake and apologized for it. Comey said:  There is no evidence that Clinton and her colleagues intended to break the law, but people who engage in similar activity are often subject to security or administrative sanctions.

"Obama hits campaign trail, says ready to 'pass baton' to Clinton","CHARLOTTE, N.C. (Reuters) - After months on the sidelines, President Barack Obama joined Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail at a rally in North Carolina on Tuesday, telling voters he was ready to pass the baton to his former secretary of state. Obama took the microphone in Charlotte, chanting Hillary! and told the crowd there had never been a candidate as prepared to be president as Clinton, his rival in 2008 for the Democratic nomination. Ive run my last campaign, and I couldnt be prouder of the things weve done together, but Im ready to pass the baton, Obama said, in what was likely to be the first of many trips this year on Clintons behalf. I know Hillary Clinton is going to take it, and I know she can run that race, he said. Obama was returning the favor after Clinton backed him in 2008s general election. This year, he waited while she battled U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination before endorsing Clinton last month once she became the partys presumptive nominee. In Charlotte, Clinton preceded Obama, saying, Were going to build on the vision for America that President Obama has always championed, a vision for a future where we do great things together. The North Carolina trip came the same day that Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said the agency would not recommend that Clinton face criminal charges over her use of a personal email system while secretary of state. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama did not get advance notice of Comeys announcement and said the president would not discuss the FBIs investigation with Clinton. Clintons campaign welcomed the end of a probe that had cast a cloud over her campaign, but Republicans seized on Comeys criticism of what he termed Clintons extremely careless handling of emails.  Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, who was due to campaign in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Tuesday, criticized FBI recommendation, tweeting, As usual, bad judgment.  The first joint campaign appearance by Obama and Clinton was initially planned for soon after she clinched the Democratic nomination. But it was postponed following the mass shooting on June 12 at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida. On Tuesday, Obama appeared at ease back on the campaign trail. He mocked Trumps promise to Make America Great Again, saying, America is really great. And he sought to contrast Clintons preparedness for the White House and passion for helping working families with Trump, a political neophyte he referred to at times as the other guy. Everybody can tweet, but nobody actually knows what it takes to do the job until youve sat behind the desk, he said, an apparent reference to the wealthy New York businessmans fondness for Twitter. Clinton hopes to reclaim North Carolina for the Democrats in the Nov. 8 election. Obama won the state in the 2008 general election but lost it narrowly in his 2012 re-election. Obamas appearance with the former first lady closes a circle on a relationship that began cordially when the two were U.S. Senate colleagues, grew tense when they were presidential rivals in 2008, and became close when Clinton served in Obamas Cabinet during his first term. Clinton and her family have played a role in Obamas elections. Clinton and Obama appeared together in Unity, New Hampshire, following their divisive primary fight in 2008, and Clintons husband, former President Bill Clinton, gave a well-received speech at the 2012 Democratic convention. Obama has focused on what he touts as Clintons strength of character, in hopes of shoring up support among voters who find her untrustworthy, a weakness Trump has sought to exploit. Clinton needs Obama to woo young and left-leaning voters who backed Sanders and who made up part of the presidents voting coalition in 2008 and 2012. Clinton has also campaigned with high-profile liberal U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, and she will appear later this week with Vice President Joe Biden. Clinton and Obama traveled to North Carolina on the presidential plane Air Force One, which Trump characterized as a burden on taxpayers. A Clinton spokesman said the campaign would cover its portion of the travel costs. ",politicsNews,"July 5, 2016 ",1
U.S. legislators to call for release of Americans held by Iran,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A resolution calling for Iran to release two U.S. citizens imprisoned there for months will be introduced on Wednesday by House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Ed Royce, a Republican, and Democratic Representative Gerry Connolly, their offices said. The resolution will call for Iran to immediately and unconditionally release businessman Siamak Namazi and his father, Baquer Namazi, 80, both of whom have dual citizenship. The text of the resolution was seen by Reuters. It will also call for U.S. President Barack Obama to undertake efforts to secure their release.  Siamak Namazi was detained by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in October while visiting relatives and has been barred from leaving Iran since July 2015. His father was arrested in Tehran in February. Irans continued wrongful jailing of Americans is very disturbing, Royce said in an emailed statement on Tuesday.Siamak and Baquer Namazi deserve to be free and with their families, and this resolution should push President Obama to step up efforts to bring them home. The resolution encourages the President to utilize appropriate measures against Irans government if the Namazis are not released, but it stops short of calling for economic sanctions, a specific request by a representative of the Namazi family, said one source familiar with the resolution who declined to be named. Siamak Namazi has criticized sanctions against Iran, writing in a 2013 opinion piece in the New York Times that Western sanctions had blocked medicines from reaching the country.  U.S. State Department spokesman Sam Werberg said the agency does not comment on resolutions before they have been formally introduced. He added, We are not aware of any charges against either Siamak or Baquer and we believe that both reported detentions are unjust.  Five American citizens were released from Iranian prisons in January as part of a prisoner swap with the United States.  Iran has detained several other dual nationals since that swap, including Homa Hoodfar, a Canadian-Iranian woman, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman and project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, and Nazak Afshar, a French-Iranian woman.

U.S. State Department disputes FBI view that it has lax security culture,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday it disagreed with FBI Director James Comeys assessment that the department as a whole has a lax attitude toward security compared to other U.S. government agencies. We dont share the broad assessment made of our institution that theres a lax culture here when it comes to protecting classified information. We take it very, very seriously, State Department spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing. His comments came after Comey announced some of the results of the FBIs yearlong investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clintons use of a private email server while she was in office. Comey said the FBI found evidence of a general lack of care for classified information at the State Department. ",politicsNews,"July 5, 2016 ",1
Ryan slams Trump 'star' tweet,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday sharply criticized Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps Twitter post depicting Democratic rival Hillary Clinton against a backdrop of cash and a Star of David, saying anti-Semitic images have no place in a presidential campaign. Candidates should know that, Ryan, the highest-ranking elected Republican, said in an interview with radio station WTMJ in Milwaukee, two days before Trump was due to meet House and Senate Republicans in Washington. I really believe hes got to clean up the way his new media works, he said, in a reference to Trumps social media efforts. The presumptive Republican nominee has frequently used Twitter to skewer his opponents and push his proposals. The radio station posted audio from the interview on its website, and the Wisconsin congressmans office provided a transcript of the session. Ryans comments came a day after Trump defended the tweet, saying he had not meant the six-pointed star to refer to the Star of David, which is a symbol of Judaism. Rather, he said, the star could have referred to a sheriffs badge, which is shaped similarly except for small circles at the ends of each of its six points, or a plain star. Republican leaders were criticized in the U.S. media for not speaking out forcefully against the image attacking Clinton, which appeared over the U.S. Independence Day holiday weekend. If I had to stop everything and comment to a ridiculous tweet sent out by this (Trump) campaign, Id have no time for anything else, said Ryan, who supports Trump but has repeatedly spoken out against Trumps rhetoric, including his criticism of a Mexican-American judge. My understanding is, this was done by staff not by he himself, Ryan said. But more importantly, theyve got clean this thing up. Trump is due to meet with House and Senate Republicans in Washington on Thursday. Ryan did not say whether the tweet was likely to come up.  House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters that the meeting would mainly focus on the newly released Republican agenda, which addresses six types of issue from poverty to tax reform. But members will be free to talk about all different angles, and ideas, and probably some people will give their opinions and ideas on how to run the campaign, McCarthy said. Asked about his comfort level with Trump, the California Republican replied: I always look for constant improvement. ",politicsNews,"July 5, 2016 ",1
White House says Obama will not discuss FBI probe with Clinton,"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will not speak with Hillary Clinton about the FBIs investigation of Clintons use of private email servers while secretary of state, the White House said on Tuesday. The president all along has believed that it is important for the Department of Justice to conduct their investigation free from any sort of perceived influence of the White House or anyone else in the federal government, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.

"FBI to recommend no charges in Clinton email probe, director says","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI will recommend to the Justice Department that no charges be filed over Hillary Clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state, agency Director James Comey said on Tuesday, lifting a cloud of uncertainty looming over her White House campaign. The agency found evidence of extremely careless handling of emails by Clinton, and that at least 110 emails contained classified information at the time they were sent, said Comey, announcing the result of a yearlong investigation. But the FBI concluded that no reasonable prosecutor would bring charges against Clinton, he said. Although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case, Comey told reporters in Washington. His recommendation will likely stand. The countrys top prosecutor, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, said on Friday she will accept the recommendations of career prosecutors and the FBI director on whether to charge Clinton for mishandling emails.  The FBI probe has dogged the presumptive Democratic presidential nominees campaign for the past year and has contributed to her low poll ratings on honesty and trustworthiness. Republicans pointed to the controversy as evidence that Clinton considered herself above the law. Donald Trump, Clintons Republican rival for the Nov. 8 election, has hammered her on the issue, saying the investigation should disqualify Clinton from being president. On Tuesday, he said the FBI decision was unfair. The system is rigged, he said on Twitter. As usual, bad judgment. The FBI has been investigating whether Clinton broke the law as result of a personal email server kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. One of the questions is whether she mishandled classified information on the server. Clinton has repeatedly said she never sent or received classified information on her private server. She had a  voluntary 3-1/2-hour interview with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Saturday in Washington. Comey said, however, there was evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information.  But he said the FBI did not find that Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate the law, and there was no intentional misconduct by her lawyers who sorted her emails. He said her staff should have known the server was in an improper place for her emails. Comey also said there was no evidence that anyone had hacked Clintons communications, although it was possible. Republican lawmakers have called for an independent investigation, saying they do not trust the Justice Department to handle the inquiry with impartiality. Republican criticism increased after Clintons husband, former President Bill Clinton, met privately with Lynch last week. Lynch later said she regretted the meeting and the two did not discuss the investigation. ",politicsNews,"July 5, 2016 ",1

"Clinton snags AFL-CIO official, former Sanders staffer, in labor outreach","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has hired two people with close ties to U.S. organized labor to try to lock down support from union members as Republican candidate Donald Trump makes courting working-class voters central to his campaign.  The two new staffers, Lori DOrazio and Michele Gilliam, are to be deputy labor campaign directors, according to a campaign aide. DOrazio is moving to the campaign from the biggest U.S. labor federation, the AFL-CIO. Gilliam is a former staffer for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who was Clintons fiercest primary competitor.   Clinton and Sanders battled fiercely over union support during the Democratic primary, with Clinton, the presumptive nominee, ultimately securing the bulk of the national endorsements from labor unions. But she will need to harness the on-the-ground manpower of unions in crucial battleground states ahead of Novembers general election match-up with the populist presumptive Republican nominee, Trump. The aide said the campaign is counting on DOrazio and Gilliam to do just that. Although organized labor is a traditionally Democratic constituency, Trump has made a play to win over rank-and-file union members by criticizing international trade deals such as the pending Trans Pacific Partnership, which labor opposes.Even so, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka warned last month when the federation endorsed Clinton that a Trump presidency would be disastrous for U.S. workers and vowed to mobilize the groups resources to defeat him. The AFL-CIO is the largest U.S. federation of labor unions that collectively represent more than 12 million workers.Before joining the AFL-CIO, DOrazio worked for another large U.S. union, the United Auto Workers, and Gilliam once served as an organizer for a local chapter of the Transport Workers Union.

Trump defends 'star' tweet; Clinton says it's anti-Semitic,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Monday defended a social media post he made two days earlier that included an image depicting Democratic rival Hillary Clinton against a backdrop of cash and a Star of David, while Clinton called the image anti-Semitic. In a tweet on Monday, Trump said he had not meant the six-pointed star to refer to the Star of David, which is a symbol of Judaism. Rather, he said, the star could have referred to a sheriffs badge, which is shaped similarly except for small circles at the ends of each of its six points, or a plain star. The presumptive Republican nominee later released a statement saying Clintons criticism of the image was an attempt to distract the public from the dishonest behavior of herself and her husband. He was referring to a heavily criticized private meeting last week between former President Bill Clinton and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch as an investigation into Hillary Clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state nears a conclusion. His tweet came after Mic News reported on Sunday that the image attacking Clinton - which included the words: History made and, inside the star, most corrupt candidate ever! - had been shared on a neo-Nazi web forum called /pol/. Reuters confirmed the image was posted there on June 22 by viewing a link to an archived version of a /pol/ page, although the page has since been updated and the image removed. Donald Trumps use of a blatantly anti-Semitic image from racist websites to promote his campaign would be disturbing enough, but the fact that its a part of a pattern should give voters major cause for concern, Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said in a statement emailed to reporters on Monday.  The Nazis forced Jews to wear a Star of David on their clothing to identify themselves during the Holocaust. Trump posted and deleted the tweet on Saturday, then tweeted a similar image in which the star was replaced by a circle. On Monday, he lashed out at journalists for continuing to report on the original tweet. Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriffs Star, or plain star! Trump wrote on Twitter. Saturdays incident was the latest departure by Trump from a recent effort to appease Republicans worried about his brash public persona by trying to appear more restrained. The Republican convention, where Trump is expected to be named the partys nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, is two weeks away. In June, Trump fired his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and began using a teleprompter to make speeches, hoping to show his campaign could be more inclusive after he aroused controversy by referring to some Mexicans crossing the U.S. border illegally as rapists, and his mocking of a disabled reporter, which Clinton has begun using in attack ads against him. Ed Brookover, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said in an interview on CNN on Monday that the campaign felt it had corrected the issue about the star by deleting Trumps original tweet.  Brookover said the images earlier appearance on the neo-Nazi forum was irrelevant.  These images get posted and reposted and reposted on social media on many forums, he said. There was never any intention of anti-Semitism. ",politicsNews,"July 4, 2016 ",1

I will continue to share my insights with Donald about the need to strengthen our economy, keep our nation safe, and ensure America is always a strong, stabilizing force around the globe, she said.

Trump met with Indiana Governor Mike Pence, also mentioned as a potential running mate, and his wife on Saturday.

U.S. senators warn against further troop cuts in Afghanistan,"KABUL (Reuters) - The international military mission in Afghanistan will fail if troop levels are reduced further, with potentially dangerous repercussions for the rest of the world, a delegation of U.S. lawmakers warned during a visit to Kabul on Monday. Fifteen years after an American-led operation toppled the Taliban in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, President Barack Obama is considering whether to maintain the current level of 9,800 U.S. troops or reduce it to 5,500 by the end of the year, as current plans call for. I cannot guarantee success if we keep 9,800, but I can ensure you failure if we go to 5,500, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters in Kabul. I will have a hard time supporting our continued presence here as its not fair to those left behind... They just cant do the job. If we go to 5,500 this place will fall apart, quickly. Graham joined U.S. senators John McCain, Benjamin Sasse, and Joe Donnelly in a visit timed so the bipartisan delegation could visit with troops during the Independence Day holiday. The Obama administration should decide on troop levels sooner rather than later, McCain said, arguing that reducing the number of troops could lead to a repeat of the disaster in Iraq, where Islamic State militants seized major cities and wide swathes of territory. McCain, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, sharply criticized the White Houses decision last year to restrict U.S. forces from targeting Taliban fighters except in self-defense and other limited circumstances. Those rules were recently relaxed on the recommendation of American commanders in Kabul, but McCain said it was almost criminal that the restrictions were in place for more than a year. The rules of engagement were so restrictive that it gave an advantage to the Taliban and other terrorist groups, the senator said. The lawmakers highlighted Afghanistans history as one of the original havens for al Qaeda terrorists and pleaded for more patience. Ultimately were going to win this fight, its just going to take decades, Sasse said. The American people well understand that staying partnered with a good ally like the Afghan government is the best way to deny future safe havens to those who would plot jihadi attacks across the globe.

Top lawmakers confident in fairness of Clinton email probe,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top lawmakers from both major U.S. political parties said on Sunday they trusted the Justice Department to appropriately handle its probe of presidential candidate Hillary Clintons private email server, after a heavily criticized meeting between Clintons husband and the U.S. attorney general. Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain said on CBS show Face the Nation that they would respect Attorney General Loretta Lynchs decision on whether to prosecute Clinton, the likely Democratic presidential nominee.  Congressman Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, also said he respected the process, though he acknowledged Lynchs private meeting last week at an airport with former President Bill Clinton was unfortunate. I think both of them wish their airplanes had never come anywhere near each other, Schiff said on Face the Nation, adding that he still had confidence in the DOJ and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to do a thorough investigation of Clintons email use. If they say they are going to conduct this investigation by the book, I believe thats whats going to happen, said Schiff, who supports Clinton for the partys nomination. Lynch said on Friday that she would accept whatever recommendations the career prosecutors working on the case made about whether to prosecute Clinton. The lawmakers endorsement for the process follows Clintons meeting Saturday with investigators at the FBIs Washington headquarters, where she answered questions for three and a half hours as part of the probe into use of her private email server. The FBI is investigating Clintons email use and whether laws were broken as a result of a personal email server kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Lawmakers and political strategists speculated on Sunday that the FBIs interview of Clinton signaled its investigation could be nearing its end. But the FBI offered no information about the status of the probe or who its targets may be. Clinton has long insisted she is not a target. Clinton herself said in comments to MSNBC on Saturday that she was pleased to have the opportunity to assist the department in bringing its review to a conclusion. Her rival, presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, said it was impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against her. The two have already begun an acrimonious battle ahead of the presidential election on Nov. 8. Democrats are hoping the issue will be resolved before their four-day convention in Philadelphia that begins July 25, which is expected to culminate with Clintons nomination for the presidential race. It is unclear what Democrats would do if Clinton were to be indicted and if any contingency plan exists.   Not all lawmakers said they were confident the Justice Department could maintain impartiality. Tom Cotton, a Republican senator, said on NBCs Meet the Press on Sunday he thought Lynchs meeting with Bill Clinton raises questions about political interference in this investigation.

"Senator McCain, visiting Pakistan, seeks better ties in Islamist fight","ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain said on Sunday he would like relations between United States and Pakistan to improve as they have a common enemy in the Islamic State and other radical Islamist groups. Relations between Pakistan and United States have been frayed over the past decade, with U.S. officials frustrated by what they term Islamabads unwillingness to act against Islamist groups such as the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network. Pakistan rejects harboring militants but says there are limits to how much it can do as it is already fighting multiple Islamist groups and is wary of blowback in the form of more terror attacks on its soil.  McCain, visiting Pakistan as part of a U.S. delegation, said he had an excellent meeting with Pakistani foreign ministry officials. We come back with a message that we have a common enemy in ISIS, radical Islam and terrorism, and we look forward to closer relations and resolving the differences we have, McCain told Pakistans national PTV channel. Relations between United States and Pakistan were tested again in May by a U.S. drone strike that killed Afghan Taliban chief Mullah Akhtar Mansour on Pakistani soil.  As part of the visit, McCain traveled to Miranshah, the capital of the restive North Waziristan region bordering Afghanistan. The region was effectively run Islamists by groups such as the Pakistani Taliban and the Haqqani network until the Pakistani military launched operations against them in 2014. I was very impressed with the progress (on the ground), said McCain, who is the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I see us working together in confronting a common challenge  radical Islamic terrorism  and these kinds of meetings are very helpful to both those countries, McCain added. The Islamic State has struggled to gain a major foothold in Pakistan, analysts say, but officials worry the group may pose a threat in the future.  Pakistan said the countrys top foreign policy official Sartaj Aziz had briefed the U.S. delegation - which includes Senators Lindsey Graham, Benjamin Sasse and Joe Donnelly - about faltering peace talks to end the civil war in Afghanistan. So far China, United States and Pakistan have struggled to persuade the Afghan Taliban to meaningfully embrace the talks. No country had as much vital stakes in the success of these joint efforts, as Pakistan, (Aziz) remarked, Pakistans foreign ministry said in a statement. ",politicsNews,"July 3, 2016 ",1
Californians seek pot of gold in marijuana legalization,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. - There is no guarantee California will vote to legalize recreational marijuana in November, but political operative and father of four Daniel Conway has already staked his future on it. Conway left his job as chief of staff to Sacramentos celebrity mayor, former Phoenix Suns NBA basketball star Kevin Johnson, to help start the marijuana investment company Truth Enterprises. He is one of hundreds in the most populous U.S. state already pushing ahead with plans to enter a market experts say will be worth $4 billion by 2020. Im someone of an age and of a demographic that sees the legalization and normalization of marijuana as inevitable, said Conway, 35. This was a chance not just to build companies but to build an industry. With a population of nearly 40 million people, and a thriving medical marijuana trade legalized 20 years ago, California already has the United States largest legal marijuana market. Legalization of recreational pot would generate an estimated $1 billion in additional taxes per year. If voters in November approve a measure to legalize and tax marijuana that qualified last Tuesday for the ballot, California would be the fifth U.S. state - and by far the largest - to allow marijuana for recreational use, joining Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska, as well as the District of Columbia. A similar ballot initiative failed in California in 2010, but recent polls show strong support for legalization. The latest effort is backed by mainstream leaders including Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, who helped negotiate the regulations and taxes it would impose. Eight other states, including Nevada and Maine, also have recreational or medical marijuana proposals headed for their 2016 ballots. Californias sheer size as the worlds 6th largest economy means a decision by its voters to legalize marijuana could accelerate the trend elsewhere. I dont believe there will be any precedent in the United States that can compare to it except for maybe the Gold Rush, said Leslie Bocskor, whose Nevada-based private equity firm, Electrum Partners, advises and invests in marijuana-related businesses. The lure of wealth in an uncharted industry is so great that thousands of people are jostling for position, said Bocskor. Since January, 115 new California companies have joined the National Cannabis Industry Association, bringing total membership in the state to 330, said Deputy Director Taylor West. New companies include cultivators, dispensaries, laboratories, law partnerships, accountants, software developers, insurers and more, she said. Their challenge is to set up an infrastructure for a business that is not yet legal. Conway and his business partner, General Hydroponics CEO Ross Haley, for example, recently purchased farmland in Northern California that they hope to use to grow marijuana but would not say where before the measure is passed. Newport Beach-based Terra Tech is trying to prepare for recreational sales while building a legal business within the states medical marijuana marketplace, which has annual sales of $2.7 billion. The company spent more than $800,000 designing and remodeling its Oakland dispensary to look more like a high-end lounge than a drab medical clinic, said CEO Derek Peterson. It also developed colorful packaging for its marijuana instead of dispensing it in prescription bottles. Despite such optimism, passage of the California measure is not certain. It is opposed by many of the same law enforcement and health care groups who helped defeat the 2010 initiative. But this time backers have the deep pockets of former Facebook president Sean Parker, support from Newsom - a Democrat expected to run for governor in 2018 - and a switch in attitude among voters who saw legalization come on line in other states. The measure would allow adults age 21 and older to possess up to one ounce of marijuana, cultivate up to six plants and sets rules for commercial cultivation, manufacture and sale. It includes rules aimed at keeping cannabis products from children, preventing impaired driving and requiring licenses for sellers. Newsom said he is backing it as a way to responsibly manage legalization, which he views as inevitable but necessary to handle carefully. As a guy with four kids, who doesnt like the drug, doesnt like the smell, doesnt want my kids to think its normalized, this is my number one concern, Newsom said.",politicsNews,"July 3, 2016 ",1
FBI interviews Hillary Clinton in private server probe,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for three and a half hours on Saturday as part of the probe into her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state, her campaign said. The interview at FBI headquarters in Washington followed a week of intense public focus on the investigation and on  Clintons viability as a presidential candidate, with four months to go to the election. Her campaign has tried for months to downplay the controversy as a distraction.   In an interview broadcast on MSNBC, Clinton said she was happy to do the FBI interview, which her spokesman earlier described as voluntary.  Ive been answering questions for over a year regarding the private email server, Clinton said. It was not clear if the questioning of Clinton signaled an imminent conclusion to the investigation in a pivotal time for the presidential race. It does follow FBI interviews of several of Clintons former staff members, as well as her top aide Huma Abedin.  Clinton is expected to be formally nominated as the Democratic candidate for the Nov. 8 presidential election at the partys convention in less than four weeks.  Timing of FBI interview, between primaries and convention, probably good timing for @HillaryClinton, tweeted David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama who served as the chief strategist for his two presidential campaigns. Best to get it behind her. Clinton is currently the front-runner for the White House with polls showing her leading presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. In a tweet on Saturday, Trump said it was impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong!   He also criticized Clintons husband, former President Bill Clinton, for meeting privately with Attorney General Loretta Lynch earlier this week, which Lynch later said she regretted, though she said they did not discuss the investigation.  What Bill did was stupid! Trump tweeted. The FBI is investigating whether anyone in Clintons operation broke the law as result of a personal email server kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. One of the questions is whether they mishandled classified information on the server.   Clinton and her staff have struggled to respond to accusations that her use of the server in violation of State Department protocol means she is untrustworthy. Trump has said the investigation should disqualify her from being president. @HillaryClinton campaign statement says She voluntarily met w @FBI for 3.5 hours this morning - yeah, lots of people volunteer 2 do that, tweeted the Republican National Committees communications director, Sean Spicer. FBI Director James Comey said in testimony to Congress in March he felt pressure to complete the investigation quickly. Adding to the uncertainty over Clinton is the FBIs refusal to say who is the target of its investigation. Republican lawmakers have called for an independent investigation, saying they do not trust the Justice Department to handle the inquiry with impartiality. Republicans, including Trump, intensified their criticism of the process on Thursday after news emerged of Lynchs meeting with Bill Clinton.  Lynch said she would accept whatever recommendations the career prosecutors working on the case made about whether to prosecute Clinton. The FBI probe and the partisan fight over the server have added an extra layer of uncertainty to one of the most tumultuous presidential races in recent memory. Trump, a political novice once dismissed by the Republican establishment, will likely emerge this month as the partys nominee and has set his sights on Clinton, who he has labeled Crooked Hillary.  Clinton held a nine-point lead over Trump in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday. ",politicsNews,"July 2, 2016 ",1
Trump tweet attacking Clinton employs image of Jewish star,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Saturday tweeted an image of rival Hillary Clinton alongside hundred-dollar bills and a Jewish star bearing the words most corrupt candidate ever!, prompting outrage and bafflement on social media.   Two hours after his initial tweet, Trump tweeted a similar image in which the six-pointed Star of David - which appears on Israels flag and which Jews were forced to wear on their clothing by the Nazis during the Holocaust - was replaced by a circle. The original tweet was deleted. Critics said the image featuring the star harkened back to centuries-old anti-Semitic stereotypes, such as the belief that Jews are greedy. Just saw #DonaldTrumps Star of David tweet. Im impressed by his ability to find a way to insult literally every kind of human being, screenwriter Cole Haddon wrote on Twitter. A Star of David, a pile of cash, and suggestions of corruption. Donald Trump again plays to the white supremacists, wrote Erick Erickson, a conservative radio host who has been critical of Trump. The tweets originated from Trumps account, @realDonaldTrump, and no other users were mentioned in them. It was not clear whether someone inside Trumps campaign made the image or whether he found it somewhere else. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, did not respond to a request for comment. The presumptive Republican nominee has been trying to assuage fears within his own party that he is alienating potential voters with offensive statements about Muslims, Latinos and women. Last month, Trump fired his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and began delivering speeches using a teleprompter, an abrupt change in style that was seen as an attempt to appear more presidential ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Saturdays tweet was a reminder of the unrestrained side of Trump. The candidate has mocked a disabled newspaper reporter, referred to undocumented immigrants from Mexico as rapists and recently pointed to a black man in the crowd at one of his rallies and called him my African-American.

North Carolina lawmakers adjourn after leaving transgender law largely unchanged,"(Reuters) - North Carolina lawmakers adjourned for the year on Friday night after leaving mostly intact a law restricting transgender bathroom access that has drawn condemnation and jeopardized the states efforts to host the NBA All-Star Game, officials said. The law passed in March made North Carolina the first U.S. state to require transgender people to use restrooms in public buildings and schools that match the sex on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity. The National Basketball Association has said it could move its All-Star Game out of Charlotte, North Carolina, and has cited concerns over the laws effects on principles of inclusion and equal protection that league officials say they uphold.   A spokesman for the NBA could not immediately be reached for comment. North Carolina state Representative Chris Sgro, a Democrat who opposes the law, which is known as House Bill 2, said he had hoped lawmakers would vote on Friday on whether to repeal it. But they adjourned for the year without holding that vote, he said. It probably means that were going to have to come back for a special session because were going to lose the All-Star Game if we dont, Sgro, who is executive director of the gay rights group Equality North Carolina, said in a phone interview. The NBA All-Star Game is scheduled for February 2017. President Barack Obama, business leaders, entertainers and some prominent politicians have criticized House Bill 2, saying it is unfair to transgender people. State lawmakers on Friday addressed one point of controversy over House Bill 2 by restoring the right to sue for wrongful termination in state court on allegations of discrimination based on age, sex, race or other factors, officials said.  House Bill 2 had removed that right and required such suits to be filed in federal court. The office of Senate Leader Phil Berger, a Republican, said in a statement the change addressed concerns from the states governor and others.  But Berger expressed continued support for House Bill 2.    Protecting the safety and privacy of North Carolina families by keeping grown men out of bathrooms, shower facilities and changing rooms with women and young girls has always been our primary objective, Berger said in a statement.  On Thursday, an NBA statement said no final decision had yet been made regarding the All-Star Game. ",politicsNews,"July 2, 2016 ",1
"Gingrich, Christie lead Trump list of vice presidential options","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie top Donald Trumps short list to be his vice presidential running mate, sources said, but the candidate is casting a wide net that also includes several U.S. senators and other governors. With less than three weeks to go until his formal nomination at the Republican National Convention as the partys candidate in the Nov. 8 election, Trumps search for a No. 2 has intensified. The wealthy businessman, a political neophyte, has said he wants a political veteran to help him navigate the power corridors of Washington.Gingrich and Christie, both loyal to Trump at a time when many Republican colleagues want nothing to do with him, would meet his requirement for experience - but would come with minuses as well as pluses. Other names to watch include U.S. Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee, Joni Ernst of Iowa and Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Governors Mike Pence of Indiana and Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, Republicans close to the campaign said this week.     Trump has set up a meeting with Pence this weekend, a spokesman for the governor said on Friday. The New Yorker has also met with Corker and Fallin. Mr. Trump is meeting with a number of Republican leaders in the run-up to the convention in Cleveland, and he has a good relationship with Gov. Pence, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said in an email response to a question from Reuters. An experienced running mate also could help with fundraising. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, raised more than $40 million for her campaign in June and about $28 million for her party. Trump, who largely self-funded his primary run, has not yet released June fundraising numbers.  Trump is expected to name his running mate close to the July 18-21 convention.  Gingrich, who was speaker of the House of Representatives in the 1990s and ran for president in 2012, is a popular conservative writer and speaker, and has been an important behind-the-scenes voice in urging Trump to adopt a more presidential demeanor. But because Trump is 70 and Gingrich is 73, they could face difficulty appealing to a younger generation. Christie quickly endorsed Trump after quitting the race early this year. A source said the 53-year-old governor has emerged as a key adviser to Trump and his campaign team. A source said Christie was instrumental in coaxing Trump to be less confrontational with a Mexican-American federal judge overseeing a fraud case involving Trump. One clue to Christies rising importance came earlier this week when some campaign supporters held a conference call to discuss strategy and talking points for media appearances. A source said that during the call Christies name was raised as someone who might comment on former President Bill Clintons meeting earlier this week with Attorney General Loretta Lynch. As a former federal prosecutor, Christie would be a credible voice.  Monday nights private meeting of Clinton and Lynch, the top U.S. law enforcement officer, has been criticized because Hillary Clinton is under federal investigation for using a private email server when she was Democratic President Barack Obamas secretary of state. The source said campaign associates made clear Christie was not to be used for this purpose. Theyre saving him for the general election, the source said. They dont want to overexpose him. Still, many Republicans are waiting to see whether Christie is named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a 2014 case involving charges that lanes on the George Washington Bridge were closed in New Jersey for political reasons. Corker, 63, offers Trump deep foreign policy experience as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and, like Trump, believes the Republican Party needs shaking up. His stock may have gone down, however, because he has not hesitated to criticize the candidate at times. Ernst, a first-term senator and military veteran, could help improve Trumps standing with women. She tacitly supported rival Marco Rubio during the Republican nominating campaign, though she has promised to support the partys nominee. Ernst, who turned 46 on Friday, said earlier this month that the Trump campaign had not contacted her. The same goes for Oklahomas Fallin, who was among several Republican governors who met jointly with Trump in June. Its an honor to be mentioned for the office of vice president. I have not had any conversation with Mr. Trump about the vice presidency, Fallin, 61, said in a statement. Some Republicans could be considered even if they have not had recent contact with the campaign. Alice Stewart, a former spokeswoman for U.S. Senator Ted Cruzs presidential campaign, said the Texans running mate, Carly Fiorina, was only told late in the vetting that she might be picked. Trumps vetting is being conducted by Washington lawyer A.B. Culvahouse, a longtime fixture in national Republican politics. ",politicsNews,"July 1, 2016 ",1
U.S. House Republican gun bill draws the ire of Democrats,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday introduced a measure intended to prevent gun sales to people on government watch lists, only to draw demands from Democrats for stronger proposals and a warning of possible new protests. A week after Democrats ended a 25-hour sit-in on the House floor to call for gun legislation after the June 12 mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, said lawmakers will vote next week on a measure giving government authorities three days to convince a judge that someone on a terrorism watch list should not be allowed to obtain a firearm. It is a responsible measure that confronts this threat while protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens, House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement. But in a Friday conference call, House Democrats reached a clear consensus to oppose the measure, calling it the handiwork of the National Rifle Association, an aide said. Similar legislation, backed by the NRA, was blocked by Democrats in the Senate last week.  Democrats also called for two amendments: one to allow the U.S. attorney general to decide without court approval whether someone on a watch list could buy a gun and another to expand existing background checks to all commercial gun sales including those at guns shows. Democratic Representatives John Lewis of Georgia and John Larson of Connecticut, who led last weeks sit-in, asked for a meeting with Ryan to request votes on the amendments, which consist of legislation originally sponsored by Republican Peter King of New York. Ryan agreed to meet with the Democrats next Tuesday, Republican and Democratic aides said. If these amendments are not allowed, then members will have further discussions about possible actions to take in response to this refusal to allow a vote on commonsense gun legislation, said another House Democratic aide. AshLee Strong, a Ryan spokeswoman, said the House speaker looks forward to meeting with Congressmen Lewis and Larson to discuss the important action the House will take to prevent terrorist attacks. The new Republican proposal, which would apply to anyone who has been suspected of violent extremism within the past five years, would require authorities to show probable cause that a would-be buyer will commit an act of terrorism or violates existing prohibitions on undocumented immigrants, fugitives, convicts and people with mental illness. The gun provisions were tucked into a bill aimed at stepping up efforts against terrorism, including what the legislation referred to as radical Islamist terrorism. Some Republicans have criticized Democrats for avoiding such terms to describe events like the Orlando shooting, where a gunman pledging allegiance to Islamic State killed 49 people last month. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said recently that President Barack Obama should resign for not having used radical Islam in a statement responding to the Orlando massacre, in which police identified the shooter as a U.S. citizen born in New York to Afghan immigrants. The NRA said it was reviewing the legislation, while the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said the legislation proposed by House Republicans was a publicity stunt.

"Chicago police, lawmakers seek harsher sentences for gun offenders","CHICAGO (Reuters) - With murders and shootings soaring in Chicago this year, the citys police chief and state lawmakers announced on Friday they will push for new laws setting harsher sentences for repeat offenders of gun crimes in Illinois. The law, which would be known as the Violent Gun Offenders Sentencing Act, is in its infant stages and would provide presumptive guidelines that judges would have to follow when ordering repeat criminals to serve jail time. Judges would be required to implement penalties on the higher range of existing sentencing laws. Part of the goal is to incapacitate, get these violent offenders off the street, state Senator Kwame Raoul said at a news conference announcing the proposed legislation. Raoul said he would sponsor the legislation along with Senator Antonio Muoz and Representative Michael Zalewski, all Democrats.  Chicago, the third-largest U.S. city, has had 307 murders so far this year, up 50 percent from the same period last year, and 1,548 shootings, up 52 percent from the same period last year, according to police statistics. Police have blamed the violence largely on gangs and a proliferation of stolen guns. There were nearly 500 homicides last year, and gun violence is up in 2016, police say. More than 50 people involved in shootings and murders in Chicago this year would have been in prison at the time of the incident if the proposed tougher sentencing policies were in place, the police department said in a statement on Friday. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the law is not designed to penalize responsible gun owners, but focus on the individuals who tell us I dont care. Legislators in the state capital, Springfield, have frequently rejected gun control measures proposed by lawmakers from Chicago. A proposal made in 2013 by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to impose tougher sanctions for illegal gun possession did not get through the state Assembly because of opposition from black lawmakers who said it could lead to higher incarceration rates for blacks in Chicago communities already struggling with high numbers of former inmates who cannot find jobs.

"New Jersey Governor Christie halts road, bridge projects","(Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie ordered a halt to non-essential road, bridge and mass transit projects late Thursday after lawmakers failed to reauthorize the state fund that pays for them. Christies executive order calls for the state Department of Transportation and New Jersey Transit to devise a plan before midnight Saturday for the orderly shutdown of projects funded by the Transportation Trust Fund. Federally funded projects will continue, Christie said in his executive order.  The state expects to receive an estimated $906 million of federal transportation aid, according to the state treasurers annual report. New Jerseys ability to borrow for new transportation projects ran out on Friday, the start of the new fiscal year. The trust fund already has about $16 billion of outstanding debt for existing road projects. The fund has roughly $80 million left, said Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman John Wisniewski, who called Christies executive order pure theater.         Without new appropriations or bond proceeds, the authority cannot pay vendors for construction. Projects at any stage - procurement, design and construction - are affected by Christies order, the Department of Transportation said. About a month ago, lawmakers discussed issuing grant anticipation revenue bonds, or so-called GARVEEs, as a stop-gap measure, but the idea was never acted upon, Wisniewski told Reuters. The flow of federal money backing those bonds is often uncertain from year to year. You cant do an annual capital program on GARVEE bonds, he said. Christie ordered the remaining money in the fund to be held only for the most essential projects in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of New Jerseyans, he said. Christie had hatched a late-night deal earlier this week with the Assembly to raise the state gasoline tax by 23 cents to 37.5 cents per gallon to replenish the fund. In exchange, the sales tax rate would shrink 1 percentage point to 6 percent, which could lead to an annual $1.7 billion shortfall in future budgets. But the Senate ended its session on Thursday without replenishing the program, which is expected to run out of money in August.  Senators were pushing their own bill, which would have phased out the estate tax on wealthy residents instead of reducing sales taxes. Christie also stripped several items out of the legislatures budget on Thursday, signing a reduced $34.5 billion budget for fiscal 2017 that is just 2.1 percent higher than that for fiscal 2016.

"California tightens gun control laws, expands assault weapons ban","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown on Friday signed a sweeping package of gun control bills, banning high-capacity ammunition magazines and expanding the definition of prohibited assault weapons in the wake of mass shootings in San Bernardino and Orlando. Democrats in the legislature rushed the measures through in hopes of passing them before their summer break, in part to try to forestall a competing gun control proposal headed for the November ballot.  California already has some of the toughest gun control laws in the nation, but after the shooting spree in the Southern California city of San Bernardino last December, lawmakers began work on measures they said would close unintended loopholes. My goal in signing these bills is to enhance public safety by tightening our existing laws in a responsible and focused manner, while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners, Brown said in a signing measure. It was a rare success for advocates of greater gun control.      U.S. lawmakers have fallen short in attempts to tighten gun laws after the killing of 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando last month.  Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced a measure on Friday that would give authorities three days to prove that someone on a terrorism watch list should not be allowed to obtain a firearm. But Democrats rejected it as toothless. The bills signed by Brown ban so-called bullet buttons, which allow quick changes in the magazine of a military-style weapon, and require background checks for purchasers of ammunition. Ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 bullets at a time will also be banned, and background checks will be needed for people borrowing guns from non-family members. Brown also vetoed several bills, including one that would have allowed co-workers, educators and mental health professionals to request restraining orders forbidding people deemed dangerous from owning guns.  Gun rights advocates called bills a Gunpocalypse.  The California Legislature showed their true faces today, said Craig DeLuz, spokesman for the Firearms Policy Coalition. They abused the legislative process to enact their depraved anti-civil rights agenda. Their efforts spilled into intra-party politics as well, after Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, who is expected to run for governor in 2018, gathered enough signatures to place his own gun control referendum on the November ballot.  The move angered the state Senates top Democrat, Kevin de Leon, who had been working to pass many of the same measures through the legislature.  Worried in part that Newsoms initiative would boost turnout in November among Republicans who oppose gun control, legislative Democrats rushed to pass their bills in time for Newsom to withdraw his measure. But the lieutenant governor refused. Todays steps in the right direction will grow into a giant leap forward for public safety if voters pass the Safety for All initiative to keep guns and ammo out of the wrong hands, he said.

Clinton's lead over Trump narrows to 9 points: Reuters/Ipsos,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clintons lead over Republican Donald Trump has dipped into the single digits among likely U.S. voters for the first time in nearly two weeks, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday. The June 27-July 1 poll showed a 9.4 percentage point lead for the former secretary of state over the New York businessman, down slightly from an 11.2 point lead in a previous five-day poll that ended on June 28. Clinton had maintained a double-digit lead in the rolling poll since June 20, as she recovered from a brief boost in Trumps numbers in the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, when he renewed a call for a ban on Muslim immigration. Among likely voters, 43.9 percent now support Clinton, compared with 34.5 percent for Trump. Another 21.7 percent of likely voters wouldnt support either candidate. Clinton is more popular among men and women, young people and minorities, college graduates, and people who live on incomes that are both lower and higher than the national average. Trump has an edge among whites, people with lower levels of education, older Americans and retirees, and he leads among people who frequently attend church. Overall, voters have increasingly sided with Clinton since mid-May, when the two were about even in the poll.  Trump is expected officially to become the Republican presidential nominee when the party holds its convention in another 2-1/2 weeks. Clinton is expected to become the Democratic nominee when the Democrats hold their convention a week later. The poll, which included responses from 1,080 likely voters, has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3.5 percentage points. Clintons lead had widened to as much as 14 percentage points in the past two weeks as Republican leaders criticized Trump for his opposition to international trade agreements and a string of nativist comments about Hipsanics and Muslims. Clintons campaign, meanwhile, has been dogged by allegations that she mishandled classified emails and failed to protect U.S. diplomats in Libya while secretary of state in Obamas first administration. She denies wrongdoing.   ",politicsNews,"July 1, 2016 ",1
U.S. attorney general to accept FBI findings in Clinton email probe,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, seeking to tamp down a firestorm over meeting with former President Bill Clinton, said on Friday she will accept the recommendations of career prosecutors and the FBI director on whether to charge Hillary Clinton for mishandling emails. The United States top law enforcement officer, however, stopped short of saying she would recuse herself from the investigation of the Democratic presidential candidate. I will be informed of those findings, as opposed to never reading them or never seeing them, but I will be accepting their recommendations and their plan for going forward, Lynch said. She was responding to questions from a Washington Post journalist who was introducing a talk by Lynch at the Aspen Ideas Festival, a gathering of government, technology and other business leaders in Aspen, Colorado. Republicans, including presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, have said a political appointee like Lynch should not be involved in the email investigation and that the Monday night meeting with Bill Clinton shows Lynch is too close to the Clintons. With a regretful tone, Lynch said on Friday she would not privately meet with Bill Clinton again and that she understood how the meeting casts a shadow over the perception of the Justice Departments probe into Hillary Clintons email use. The attorney general said she has received many questions about her role in the investigation and whether someone who was a political appointee would be involved in deciding how to investigate.  Republican lawmakers have called for an independent investigation of Hillary Clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state, saying the Obama administrations Justice Department could not be free of bias.  In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told a daily news briefing that the investigation is being handled completely independently of the White House and President Barack Obama. Lynch was appointed by the Democratic president and sworn in on April 1, 2015, well after Hillary Clinton left Obamas Cabinet in 2013. Career prosecutors are not appointed by a president and may serve through different administrations. The FBI director is appointed by the president but is not part of his Cabinet and is considered apolitical.   Lynch said on Friday that she had already decided to accept whatever recommendations prosecutors presented her before her meeting with Bill Clinton.  The private meeting with the former president took place on Lynchs plane after she landed in Phoenix on Monday night. Bill Clinton was leaving the airport after a rally for his wife earlier that day. Lynch told reporters earlier this week that she did not discuss the email probe or other matters pending before the Justice Department with Bill Clinton, calling their meeting primarily social.  The FBI is investigating Hillary Clintons email use and whether laws were broken as a result of a personal email server kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state, an issue that has overshadowed her campaign. She apologized last year for using the server, saying that while she did nothing wrong, she should have used two email accounts: one for State Department business and another for personal matters. Representatives for her campaign could not be reached immediately for comment on Friday.  Trump on Thursday called Lynchs meeting a sneak and questioned the judgment of both Bill Clinton and the attorney general. In a tweet on Friday, the wealthy businessman said the meeting showed the U.S. political system was totally rigged and that Hillary Clinton had bad judgment.  Bills meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary! Trump said on Twitter. The Justice Department, along with the White House, has said the probe should be free of political interference.

Puerto Rico says will default on $779 million of senior debt,"SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico on Friday said it will default on $779 million worth of constitutionally backed debt, its most senior bonds, making good on threats that the island would choose paying essential services for its citizens over obligations to creditors. Debt payments totaling just over $2 billion were due on Friday. Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla told reporters on Friday that overall the U.S. commonwealth territory will not pay $911 million worth of its obligations. The U.S. territorys finances will soon come under a U.S. federal oversight board after U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law on Thursday a bill giving the island access to a debt restructuring process, and implementing a halt on litigation arising from any defaults on its $70 billion debt load. Today, Puerto Rico is protected against creditors actions, Garcia Padilla said. The General Obligation (GO) debt, or debt that carries a GO guarantee, is a category of debt that has not been defaulted upon by any U.S. state in decades. Puerto Rico is not covered by Chapter 9 U.S. bankruptcy code which applies to municipalities. Puerto Ricos Government Development Bank (GDB) said on Friday the island would have just $95 million in cash at the end of the year even after the defaults announced on Friday. Puerto Ricos benchmark 2035 GO bond rose 0.25 points in price to trade at 67.50 points, pushing the yield down to 12.519 percent. On Thursday Garcia Padilla authorized Puerto Rico, under a locally written debt moratorium law, to suspend some of the $2 billion in debt payments due on Friday. The developments on Friday represent the nadir of a decade-long effort by Puerto Rico to avoid economic collapse. The island is hamstrung by emigration and a 45 percent poverty rate.  Even if the Commonwealth were to devote every last penny in the (accounts) to debt service on July 1, it would still owe holders of the public debt hundreds of millions of dollars, the GDB said in a statement on Friday. Some of the debt expected to be defaulted upon such as PBA (Public Building Authority) ex-series L bonds will be mostly covered by reserve funds held by the trustee bank. Nearly all of the payments due on the Puerto Rico Infrastructure Financing Authority (PRIFA) Bond Anticipation Notes (BANs) will be covered by reserve funds as well.  If some of the debt is covered by insurance policies, some creditors could receive a portion of their payments.   The GDB, Puerto Ricos primary fiscal agent, said the island has only $200 million in its operating account, and another $150 million in revenue that was redirected in recent months away from other debt payments.   Even if the island continues emergency measures like suspending vendor payments and withholding contributions to a pension fund that is already insolvent, the operating account will still run out of cash in 30 to 60 days, the GDB said. We knew this day would come, that they would default, and it is here. It was a good thing they passed PROMESA, even at the eleventh hour, Ted Hampton, senior credit officer at Moodys Investors Service, said, referring to the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA). Late on Thursday the islands legislature approved an $8.9 billion fiscal 2017 budget, which now awaits Garcia Padillas signature. In the wee hours of Friday, Puerto Rico released long-awaited audited financial statements for fiscal year 2014, more than a year late.  The statements, audited by KPMG, showed, among other things, that Puerto Ricos largest public pension has exhausted its assets and is now insolvent. Puerto Ricos pensions have among the largest funding gaps in U.S. history. When I entered office, Puerto Rico was property of Wall Street, Garcia Padilla said, adding: Today, everybody concludes that we have been telling the truth about Puerto Ricos fiscal condition.

Trump to meet Indiana Governor Mike Pence over the weekend,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump will meet this weekend with Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a Pence spokesman said on Friday, after a report the governor was being vetted as a potential running mate for the Republican presidential candidate. As the Republican candidate for vice president, Pence, a social conservative from a Midwestern state, could help the real estate mogul reassure wary Republicans. The governor, who faces a tight race for re-election to a second term in Indiana, has praised Trump in the past but did not back him in the Republican Partys nominating race. Governor Pence has accepted an invitation to spend a little time with Mr. Trump this weekend, said Marc Lotter, deputy campaign manager of Pences re-election effort. This meeting is very consistent with meetings Mr. Trump is holding with many key party leaders. Earlier, MSNBC, citing unnamed sources, said Trump is considering Pence, 57, as a potential running mate. The network, which first reported the upcoming meeting, said it was part of the vetting process. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich are also under consideration to be Trumps running mate, sources told Reuters.  Trump is meeting with a number of Republican leaders in the run-up to the convention in Cleveland, and he has a good relationship with Gov. Pence, Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said in an email. Republicans will hold their party convention July 18-21 in Cleveland to formally pick their nominee ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. Trump, 70, a real estate mogul and former television reality star, was scheduled to speak at rally in Colorado on Friday. He has said he has narrowed down his potential running mates to five or six contenders, according to media reports. On Thursday, Pence told reporters he had not spoken with Trump since before Indianas May 3 primary contest, MSNBC said. The governor had earlier pledged to back former Trump rival Ted Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas and Tea Party favorite. ",politicsNews,"July 1, 2016 ",1

Federal judge blocks Florida law to end abortion clinic funding,"TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - A federal judge has blocked parts of a new Florida law aiming to cut off state funding for preventive health services at clinics that also provide abortions, acting shortly before the restrictions took effect on Friday. U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle issued a preliminary injunction late on Thursday after state Planned Parenthood affiliates challenged certain provisions as unconstitutional. Hinkle found the clinics were unacceptably targeted by state efforts to eliminate funding for other healthcare services they also provide, such as birth control and screening for cancer and sexually transmitted diseases. The states only beef is that the plaintiffs provide abortions, he wrote, noting that Florida already prohibits funding for abortions, as courts have held permissible. Florida is among many states adopting new abortion laws as conservatives seek to chip away at the U.S. Supreme Courts landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. Supporters argued that the wide-ranging law adopted this spring in Florida would protect womens health. It included restrictions similar to those in a Texas law that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down earlier this week. Planned Parenthood, however, did not challenge in its lawsuit a related provision requiring doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, a type of formal affiliation that can be difficult to obtain. The organizations lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for Northern District of Florida, focused on the funding cuts, which it said jeopardized about $500,000 annually. Planned Parenthood also challenged a new requirement that state inspectors review 50 percent of patient medical records at abortion clinics. Hinkles 25-page injunction also blocked the additional inspections, noting that the volume requirements for abortion clinics far exceeded the standards for other medical facilities. The inspection provision is a solution in search of a problem, Hinkle wrote. In the lawsuit, Planned Parenthood also raised concerns about changes in how the state defines gestational stages. The terminology was clarified during a court hearing, said Laura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, who applauded the judges ruling. This means this vital programs will continue to go forward, she said in a phone interview. Because anti-womens health politicians want to end abortion, they went to the lengths of trying to stop these preventive services.  The Florida Department of Health, named in the lawsuit, did not immediately provide comment. Neither did the office of Florida Governor Rick Scott, a Republican. ",politicsNews,"July 1, 2016 ",1
U.S. report on civilian drone casualties expected Friday: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. report on the number of civilian casualties from American counterterrorism strikes will be issued later on Friday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. President Barack Obama has long promised to increase transparency about his administrations use of drones. His administration said in March it would publicly release an assessment of combatant and noncombatant casualties from U.S. counterterrorism strikes in areas outside active war zones since 2009. The drone campaign has come under criticism by human rights groups and others who say the strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia and Libya have caused civilian casualties. Human rights groups, which accuse the Obama administration of not being forthcoming about the precise guidelines that govern drone strikes, have welcomed the expected report amid their calls for greater transparency about the impact from such strikes.

Obama not involved in attorney general's decision on Clinton probe: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clintons email use is being handled completely independently of the White House and President Barack Obama, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Friday. Obama and the White House were not at all involved in the decision announced by Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Friday that she would accept the Justice Departments findings on the investigation, Earnest told a daily news briefing.

Obama says Congress must end deadlock on Zika funding,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday said Congress must end its deadlock on funding to combat the Zika virus before lawmakers head out to recess later this summer. The good news is we feel fairly confident that we can develop an effective vaccine for Zika, Obama said after a meeting with U.S. health officials in the Oval Office. The problem is right now that money is stuck in Congress. Obama met with the heads of the Health and Human Services Department, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to discuss the nations response to the mosquito-borne virus. Earlier this week, Senate Democrats blocked a Republican proposal to provide $1.1 billion in funding to combat Zika. Democrats and the White House said the plan fell short of Obamas $1.9 billion funding request and included measures that would take funds from other important health initiatives. We have not seen the House (of Representatives) and Senate come together in a sensible way to put forward the dollars that we have requested to get the job done, Obama said. I expect Congress to get this funding done before they adjourn, as part of their basic responsibility. U.S. lawmakers typically go on recess in August to go campaign for re-election in their home districts.  Following the deadlock, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have accused each other of playing politics with the health crisis. Zika has caused concern throughout the Americas due to an alarming rise in cases of the birth defect known as microcephaly and other severe fetal brain abnormalities linked to the virus reported in Brazil, the country hardest hit by the outbreak.  Infants with microcephaly tend to have abnormally small heads and may experience potentially disabling developmental problems. While Obama said there have not been any cases reported of local transmission of the virus in the continental United States, he said the nation is home to mosquitoes that carry the virus. It is absolutely critical for the United States government, working in concert with other governments in the hemisphere, to be pushing hard right now to get this situation under control, Obama said. As of June 23, there have been seven babies born in the United States with microcephaly or other Zika-related birth defects such as serious brain abnormalities, and five lost pregnancies from either miscarriage, stillbirth or termination.

Lynch says meeting with Bill Clinton 'casts a shadow' over email probe,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Friday she understands how her meeting with former president Bill Clinton casts a shadow over the perception of independence in the investigation her department is conducting into his wifes email use.  Bill Clinton met with Lynch on her plane in Phoenix on Monday night, triggering a firestorm from Republicans and a public statement from Lynch that she will accept whatever outcome independent investigators decide at the end of the probe into the Democratic presidential front-runners use of a private email server.

Trump floats idea of using NATO in fight against Islamic State,"WASHINGTON - Republican Donald Trump said on Thursday that if elected president Nov. 8 he would be open to drawing NATO forces into the fight against Islamic State militants in a new mission for an alliance he has called obsolete. Trump made the comments in an interview with ABC News. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee has for months raised questions about the money the United States pours into NATO, which he says needs to be reconfigured to take account of todays threats. I like the idea of using NATO and also neighbors that arent in NATO and take them out. You gotta take them out, Trump said. Under President Barack Obama, the United States has relied heavily on U.S. airstrikes to attack Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq. Republicans have criticized this policy as not enough to stop the militants. Trump said the idea of using the Cold War-era alliance would be to ease the load on American forces. I dont want to get too much of ours involved. I want NATO to be involved, Trump said. We spend a tremendous amount of money on NATO. We take care of countries that frankly should be taking care of themselves in terms of economically. Trumps comments came amid an uproar over a meeting between former President Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch at a time when Clintons wife, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, is under federal investigation. The private meeting took place on Lynchs plane after she landed in Phoenix on Monday night and Bill Clinton was leaving the airport after a rally he held for his wife earlier that day. Hillary Clinton is under an FBI investigation for her use of a private email server when she was President Barack Obamas first-term secretary of state. Trump told conservative radio talk show host Mike Gallagher that the meeting was proof of his charge that the U.S. political system is rigged in favor of political elites. Its unheard of, Trump told ABC News. You have this massive investigation on emails and theyd have a meeting like this. Lynch, appointed to her position by Obama more than a year ago, said she did not discuss the email investigation or other pending matters before the Justice Department with Bill Clinton.  When I was landing at the airport, I did see President Clinton at the Phoenix airport as I was leaving and he spoke to myself and my husband on the plane, Lynch told reporters.  Our conversation was a great deal about grandchildren. It was primarily social and about our travels. He mentioned the golf he played in Phoenix and he mentioned travels he had to West Virginia...But there was no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending before any other body, Lynch said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating Hillary Clinton about her email use and has already interviewed some of her aides. The investigation into whether laws were broken as a result of the server kept in her New York home has overshadowed Clintons campaign. Obama is preparing to campaign with Hillary Clinton for the first time in her 2016 White House bid. They are to appear together in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Tuesday. A Reuters/Ipsos poll this week showed Clinton 11 points ahead of the billionaire businessman    At the White House, spokesman Josh Earnest made clear that Obama believes an impartial investigation is crucial and noted that Lynch had said the conversation was benign.  I think the bottom line is simply that both the president and the attorney general understand how important it is for the Department of Justice to conduct investigations that are free of political interference, Earnest told reporters.  U.S. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, cited the incident in renewing his call for an independent counsel to take over the Clinton probe from the FBI.

Puerto Rico authorizes debt payment suspension; Obama signs rescue bill,"SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico authorized suspension of payments on its general obligation debt on Thursday just minutes after U.S. President Barack Obama signed a law creating a federal oversight board with authority to negotiate the restructuring of the islands $70 billion in debt. The executive order issued by Puerto Ricos governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, comes just one day before the U.S. territory was due to make $1.9 billion worth of debt payments on July 1, including some $780 million in constitutionally-backed, general obligation bonds. It remains to be seen whether Puerto Rico will pay part of the GO debt or any of the non-GO debt. Under these circumstances, these executive orders protect the limited resources available to the agencies listed in these orders and prevents that these can be seized by creditors, leaving Puerto Ricans without basic services, Garcia Padillas administration said in a statement.  The flurry of activity represents the nadir of a decade-long struggle by Puerto Rico, home to 3.5 million Americans, to stave off economic collapse, reverse a 45 percent poverty rate and stem rampant emigration that exacerbates the economys decline.   Garcia Padilla authorized the suspension of general obligation payments under a previously enacted local debt moratorium law that has already been challenged by a creditor lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.  In addition, Garcia Padilla also declared states of emergency at the islands biggest public pension - the Commonwealths Employee Retirement System - which is more than 99 percent underfunded, as well as the University of Puerto Rico and other agencies. Puerto Ricos benchmark 2035 General Obligation bond rose 0.44 points in price to trade at 67.19 points, pushing the yield down to 12.578 percent.   In Washington, Obama signed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act, or PROMESA, in the Oval office on Thursday, one of the few pieces of bi-partisan legislation to make it to his desk. I want to let the people of Puerto Rico know that although there are still some tough work that were going to have to do to dig Puerto Rico out of the hole that its in, this indicates how committed my administration is to making sure that they get the help they need, Obama told reporters before signing it. The law will allow the island access to a bankruptcy-like debt restructuring process, but put its finances under the control of a federally-appointed board  a condition that has riled many in Puerto Rico, including Garcia Padilla. PROMESA, which passed the U.S. Senate on Wednesday, puts a stay, or halt, on litigation in the event of a default. Puerto Rico has already defaulted three times on portions of its debt in the last year. The stay is critical to keep Puerto Ricos financial restructuring from devolving into a mess of long, costly court battles. The stay is retroactive back to December 2015. The oversight board will have the authority to facilitate consensual restructuring talks, or push Puerto Rico into a court-supervised process akin to U.S. bankruptcy.It will also oversee and monitor the implementation of sustainable budgets.   Still, missed payments matter for the insurers who have to pay out on claims should Puerto Rico not deliver the cash to its investors. MBIAs National Public Finance Guarantee insures about $173 million in GO debt due on Friday, while Assured Guaranty covers another $184 million, and Ambac insures $40 million in GO or GO-guaranteed debt due on Friday.   The islands debt-laden semi-public power utility, PREPA,  earlier on Thursday announced it will make its full, $415 million payment due Friday, under the terms of a restructuring agreement reached late last year with the bulk of its creditors. PREPA, which had been on the brink of collapse under $8.3 billion in debt, last year reached an exchange deal with most of its creditors, which is being finalized. The payment will be made using operational funds and proceeds from new bond sales. Todays outcome is another step towards PREPAs transformation, Lisa Donahue, the utilitys chief restructuring officer, said in a statement. ",politicsNews,"June 30, 2016 ",1
House of Representatives reignites gun-control debate with planned vote,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives, under mounting pressure to advance gun-control legislation, will vote next week on a measure to keep guns out of the hands of people on government terrorism watch lists. Republican and gun lobby sources said the legislation, due to be introduced as part of a terrorism package, was likely to be a National Rifle Association-backed bill brought by Representative Lee Zeldin of New York as the companion to a Senate Republican measure from Senator John Cornyn of Texas. House Democrats, who last week staged a 25-hour sit-in on the House floor to push for gun control after the June 12 mass shooting in Orlando, condemned the Cornyn-Zeldin measure as the handiwork of the NRA. Senate Democrats blocked the same legislation last week.   House Democrats will keep up our efforts to push for the majority to allow a vote on gun violence legislation, but bringing up a bill authored by the NRA just isnt going to cut it, said Drew Hammill, an aide to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. The NRA denied writing the legislation.  House Speaker Paul Ryan announced the plan in a conference call with lawmakers. Republican leadership aides declined to provide details. One said the package was still being negotiated. After the Orlando, Florida, shooting that killed 49 people and wounded 53 more at a gay nightclub [nL1N19L1WH], gun-control proponents ratcheted up pressure for meaningful legislation.  We are going to get something done this year, I predict, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid told reporters. I think were going to take a bite out of the NRA. Reid said he was hopeful for a bill introduced by Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, and a bipartisan House companion bill backed by Republicans including Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida, to prevent gun sales to anyone on the governments No Fly List for terrorism suspects or the Selectee List for extra airport screening.   Before Thursdays announcement, Representative Bob Dold of Illinois, a Republican backer of the Collins-Curbelo bill, urged Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to opt for the bipartisan measure, according to a Dold aide. But hopes for a vote on that measure could be dashed if House Republicans move first on the Cornyn-Zeldin bill, which would allow party leaders to say they had acted on gun control.   It would really be a sharp blow, said Representative Scott Rigell, a Virginia Republican and NRA member who supports the Collins-Curbelo measure. The NRA-backed measure would give officials three days to decide whether a gun sale should be blocked. Democrats argue the timetable is insufficient and say the government would have to persuade a court that a would-be buyer has committed or will commit an act of terrorism before it could block a gun sale. Under the Collins-Curbelo bills, a court would have 14 days to decide on appeals. ",politicsNews,"June 30, 2016 ",1

U.S. lawmakers push for action on human rights in Bahrain,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Seven U.S. senators urged Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday to press Bahrains government to do more to promote political and social reform, adding to recent concern in Washington over that countrys human rights record. The letter said the United States should be prepared to consider tangible consequences, including reconsidering arms sales, if a recent crackdown on opposition continues. Bahrains failure to address the legitimate grievances of its citizens has strained the countrys social fabric and invited outside actors to take advantage of the deteriorating situation, six Democratic lawmakers and one Republican said in a letter to Kerry, a former Democratic senator. Indeed, we believe the governments harsh crackdown on the political opposition undermines the countrys stability and plays into the hands of Iran, they wrote, calling themselves deeply alarmed. State Department spokesman John Kirby said he was aware of reports about the letter, but had not seen it. Asked about whether U.S. arms provided to Bahrain could be used against the opposition, he said, We always have concerns about the end use of items that are inside the foreign military sales program. Bahrain, which hosts the United States Fifth Fleet and is seen by Sunni-ruled Gulf kingdoms as a strategic bulwark against Iranian influence, drew U.S. and United Nations criticism this month when it moved to strip a top Shiite clerics citizenship and closed the main Shiite opposition group.  A State Department report, first reported by Reuters, found Bahrains national reconciliation efforts after it crushed street protests in 2011 have stalled, and said the Western ally in the Gulf has not implemented recommendations to protect freedom of expression. We continue to urge the government of Bahrain to reverse their recent harmful actions, Kirby said a news briefing on Thursday. Earlier this week, the State Department said Bahrains plan to try an activist for tweets condemning its prison system and involvement in the war in Yemen is worrisome to the United States. The letter was led by Democratic Senator Chris Murphy and also signed by Republican Marco Rubio and Democrats Patrick Leahy, Ron Wyden, Bob Casey, Chris Coons and Tim Kaine. It asked for more information on specific actions President Barack Obamas administration is taking to press Bahrains leadership on the issue. ",politicsNews,"June 30, 2016 ",1

Puerto Rico's PREPA says will make full debt payment on Friday,"SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Ricos semi-public power utility, known as PREPA, on Thursday said it would make all of a $415 million debt payment due on Friday, a relief for bond insurers who might have been on the hook in the event of default.     PREPA, which had been on the brink of collapse under $8.3 billion in debt, last year reached an exchange deal with most of its creditors, which is being finalized. On Thursday, the utility said it would make its $415 million payment using operational funds and proceeds from the new bond sales. Todays outcome is another step toward PREPAs transformation, Lisa Donahue, the utilitys chief restructuring officer, said in a statement. The payment is not a shock because PREPA and its creditors have had the framework of a restructuring deal in place since December. But debt payments in the U.S. territory are being watched closely as the island is expected to default on pieces of $1.9 billion owed on Friday, and President Barack Obama prepares to sign a bill putting the islands finances under federal oversight. Puerto Rico faces $70 billion in total debt, a stalled economy, and high poverty and unemployment. The $1.9 billion due on Friday - of which PREPAs payment was a portion - includes nearly $800 million in general obligation (GO) debt, the islands highest-ranking debt protected by a constitutional pledge. It was unclear on Thursday whether Puerto Rico would make that payment. On Wednesday night, the U.S. Senate passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which Obama has said he will sign, providing for a bankruptcy-like debt restructuring process for Puerto Rico, as well as federal oversight of its finances. While PROMESA contemplates a stay on litigation in the event of default, missed payments matter for the insurers who have to pay out on claims. MBIAs National Public Finance Guarantee insures about $139 million of the PREPA payment due on Friday, while Assured Guaranty covers about $35 million. National insures another $211 million in other debt due on Friday, including $173 million in GO debt, a company spokesman said on Wednesday. Assured covers another $329 million due Friday, about $184 million of which is GO debt, a spokeswoman said. Ambac, which insures more than $2 billion of Puerto Rican bonds, is on the hook for $122 million in principal and interest due on Friday, including some $40 million in GO or GO-guaranteed debt, according to the companys public documents.

Albanian town backs Clinton with bronze bust,"SARANDE, Albania (Reuters) - Whatever the outcome of Novembers U.S. presidential election, the Albanian town of Sarande is backing Hillary Clinton by erecting a bronze bust to thank her for supporting Albanian causes. Albania is a staunch ally of the United States and has a history of commemorating its presidents.  Woodrow Wilson has a statue there for helping foster the young Albanian state. So does George W. Bush, who visited Albania in 2007 and backed the independence of Kosovo, whose population is mainly ethnic Albanian. Bill Clinton has a statue in Kosovo in recognition of his role in the bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 in support of Kosovo. This bust in our most central public space is an expression of our gratitude through Mrs. Clinton to the American people and state for what they have done for the Albanian people and nation, Sarande Mayor Florjana Koka told a small crowd. It was also a tribute to Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, as an example to women in politics, said Koka, the first female mayor of Sarande. American tourist Jessica Rightmayer wiped away tears as the U.S. national anthem was played. I think it is beautiful and I really think it is a very good likeness, she said. Sculptor Idriz Balani said the idea for the statue came to him when Hillary Clinton told the Albanian parliament in 2012 that Albania and the United States had together marked the Balkan countrys first centenary and would be friends for another 100 years. Her charm, elegance and vitality had convinced him to sculpt her. I used three photos to get her smile, hair, posture and attire right and kept the necklace. She exudes benevolence.

Panel's report reignites debate over Clinton and Benghazi,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Republicans on Tuesday accused Hillary Clintons State Department of failing to protect four Americans killed in a 2012 attack in Libya, in a final report that contained no major new revelations but rekindled debate on the U.S. presidential campaign trail. In an 800-page report that Democrats derided as a political vendetta, Republicans said Clinton, who served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 and is now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and her staff showed a shameful lack of response to congressional investigators looking into the attacks on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. The report, the culmination of a two-year investigation by a special congressional committee led by Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, is likely to be the last official attempt to investigate the attack. Seven other congressional panels have also investigated the attack on the U.S. diplomatic and CIA posts in Benghazi. The latest investigation has been used by Republicans to attack Clintons national-security credentials. Opinion polls have shown Americans deeply split along partisan lines over the probe. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has repeatedly charged that Clinton is personally responsible for the deaths of a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans killed by militia groups in the Sept. 11, 2012 incident. Clintons campaign dismissed the committees report, saying it had not found anything that had not been discovered by previous congressional probes. White House press secretary Josh Earnest labeled the effort a political exercise. Clinton, speaking in Denver, said it was crucial to learn the right lessons from the Benghazi tragedy. No one has thought more about or lost more sleep over the lives that we lost - the four Americans - which was devastating, said Clinton. Trump waited until hours after the reports release to comment. Benghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure, he said on Twitter. It just never seems to work the way its supposed to with Clinton. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Clintons actions as secretary of state were disqualifying. Hillary Clinton was in charge, knew the risks, and did nothing to protect personnel on the ground in Libya, he said. Professor Julian Zelizer, a political analyst at Princeton University, called the report old news but said that would not stop Trump from trying to exploit the issue going forward. A story like this, even though it seems familiar, can still serve to mobilize Republicans, and certainly Donald Trump will do that. Hell certainly try, Zelizer said.  Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist, said he doubted the report would influence undecided voters. Those who are willing to believe that there was wrongdoing on Secretary Clintons part were unlikely willing to vote for her in the first place, he said. At a news conference on Capitol Hill, Gowdy, chairman of the special congressional panel, said there was a disconnect between the violence unfolding in Benghazi and the perception among top Obama administration officials that the fighting had subsided at the U.S. diplomatic compound. The committees report faulted the State Department for providing inadequate security for the U.S. compound in Benghazi, State Department officials and the CIA for failing to properly evaluate the threat to U.S. personnel on the ground, and the Pentagon for not being in position to aid the Americans under siege. The report did not dispute assertions by the Obama administration that such a mission would have come too late to help the four who were killed. None of those conclusions, however, came as revelations. All had been reached by previous probes. The report also accused the White House of stonewalling the investigation, something aides to Obama have denied. Democrats on the Benghazi committee issued their own report a day before Tuesdays release, accusing Republicans of conducting an overzealous investigation. According to a website maintained by committee Democrats, the investigation cost more than $7.1 million, a figure that excludes money spent on investigations by the seven other congressional committees that investigated the attacks. The Gowdy committee investigation lasted 782 days, longer than congressional probes of Pearl Harbor, the Kennedy assassination, the Iran-Contra scandal and Hurricane Katrina. Since it was established in May 2014, the Gowdy committee has held four public hearings, according to its website, which said that it interviewed 107 witnesses, mostly behind closed doors, including 81 who never appeared before the other committees that investigated the attacks. It reviewed about 75,000 pages of previously unexamined documents. Last October, Clinton, already a Democratic presidential candidate, calmly deflected harsh Republican criticism of her handling of the attack during a testy 11-hour hearing before the Gowdy committee. In testimony that stretched deep into the night, Clinton rejected Republican accusations that she ignored requests for security upgrades in Libya and misinformed the public about the cause of the attack. Clintons appearance before the panel followed months of controversy about her use of a private home email server for her State Department work, a disclosure that emerged in part because of the panels demand to see her official records. A 2012 report by a government accountability review board faulted State Department officials for providing grossly insufficient security in Benghazi, despite upgrade requests from Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and others in Libya. ",politicsNews,"June 28, 2016 ",1
Zika sex research begins despite U.S. Congress funding impasse,"(Reuters) - It could take years to learn how long men infected with Zika are capable of sexually transmitting the virus, which can cause crippling birth defects and other serious neurological disorders. In the meantime, health officials have warned couples to refrain from unprotected sex for six months after a male partner is infected. The extraordinary recommendation, based on a single report of Zika surviving 62 days in semen, could affect millions. The grave risks associated with Zika, along with its potential reach, are driving U.S. health authorities to pursue research even though funding is mired in Congressional gridlock. A study of sexual transmission risk is one example of science that health officials said cant wait for politics. Borrowing money earmarked for other programs, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has started enrolling men infected with Zika in Brazil and Colombia in the study to determine how long the virus remains transmittable in semen. The study could take years to complete, but interim results could help public health officials fine-tune their recommendations on sex. We are going out on a limb, but we have to, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. institute, said in an interview. We cant say were going to wait until we get all the money. Public health officials are alarmed by Zikas transmission versatility, which has the potential to expand its reach. It is primarily spread by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, as are the dengue and chikungunya viruses. But at least 10 countries, including the United States and France, have reported Zika infections in people who had not traveled to an outbreak area but whose sexual partners had. This ability to spread through sex could help Zika gain a further foothold outside the warm habitats of its most effective agent, the mosquito. To protect women who are pregnant or trying to conceive, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended couples refrain from unprotected sex for six months - triple the 62 days the virus survived in the semen in one British case study. The World Health Organization recently issued similar guidance. But such strict advice is not ideal, Dr. Anne Schuchat, a CDC deputy director, said in an interview. To tell people not to have sex until we get back to you is not a very satisfying recommendation, she said. We would like to have some more understanding of the sexual risk. In the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, where more than 2,100 cases of infection have been reported since the start of the year, health officials are passing out Zika protection kits that include bug spray and condoms, along with the recommendation. But the warning against unprotected sex isnt going over very well, said Dr. Chris Prue, a CDC behavioral scientist who has studied the response. Condoms are not popular in a lot places, she said. Theres religious and personal preferences and lots of personal factors in that. U.S. lawmakers deadlocked over funding to fight the Zika virus on Tuesday, as Senate Democrats blocked a Republican proposal they said fell short of the challenge posed by the virus and hurt other health priorities. It was unclear when Congress would revisit the request by President Barack Obama for $1.9 billion. In the meantime, the White House has diverted more than $500 million earmarked for other projects for urgent Zika initiatives, including those where scientific opportunities will be lost if not acted upon immediately. One such study will follow children born to women infected with Zika to identify the development of any disabilities not detected at birth. Other projects on the priority list include vaccine development and mosquito eradication.   One study underway will assess whether the risk of transmission is greater from men who experience Zika infection symptoms, such as fever and rash, than from those who dont. This information is considered vital since most people experience no symptoms. The study of infected men in Brazil and Colombia will test semen from thousands of men over time to determine how long Zika poses a risk to sexual partners. As long the virus can be grown in a laboratory from semen cell samples, infectious disease experts believe it is potentially contagious. Zika typically clears the bloodstream about a week after infection, but it has been detected in urine for at least twice as long. Its persistence in semen in the British case study has caused some researchers to draw comparisons to other viruses. HIV can last in blood and semen indefinitely, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus can reside in the kidneys and urine for years, researchers said. One patient who survived the deadly Ebola outbreak had evidence of that virus in his semen for 18 months. We got very surprised by Ebola that it was hanging around for so long, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. One of the big questions we have to ask is does Zika also cause a similar type of latency? ",politicsNews,"June 30, 2016 ",1
"Senate passes Puerto Rico debt bill, sends to Obama","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate gave solid approval on Wednesday to a relief plan to help Puerto Rico address its $70 billion debt, sending the measure to President Obama for his signing into law just ahead of a possible default by the U.S. territory on its next debt payment. The measure passed the Senate on a vote of 68-30, and President Obama said in a statement he looked forward to signing the bill into law. The House of Representatives has already approved the bill. This bill is not perfect, but it is a critical first step toward economic recovery and restored hope for millions of Americans who call Puerto Rico home, Obama said.  The legislation would create a federal oversight board, appointed by Washington, with power to restructure Puerto Ricos unmanageable debt load. The bill provides for a stay, or halt, to any litigation brought against the Puerto Rican government and its debt issuing agencies that is retroactive to December. This provides breathing room for the board to start the process of restructuring and oversee a sustainable budget process.  On Friday, Puerto Rico faces a potential default on a chunk of its debt if it cannot make $1.9 billion worth of payments. Puerto Ricos Governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, has said the island will default some of the debt. Supporters said intervention by Washington lawmakers was necessary to help the islands 3.5 million U.S. citizens avert a descent into chaos, as U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Tuesday. Puerto Rico has been waiting for months for Congress to act as its economic crisis worsened. It has already defaulted on some of its debt. The Caribbean island territory is reeling from a 45 percent poverty rate, as well as a steady flow of migration to the U.S. mainland that shrinks its tax base and shuttering of essential services. In addition, it is suffering from a Zika virus outbreak that is hurting its critical tourism industry. But many Puerto Ricans are leery of the proposed oversight board, fearing it could usurp the islands government and place investors concerns over localpriorities.  Puerto Ricos benchmark 2035 General Obligation bond rose 1 full point in price ahead of the final vote, to trade at 66.75 points, pushing the yield down to 12.663 percent.  Passage of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) came after leaders of both political parties warned that failure to approve the legislation could lead to a U.S. taxpayer-funded bailout. This is the best and possibly the only action we can take to help Puerto Rico, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said. Doing nothing now ... (is) the surest route to both a taxpayer funded bailout of Puerto Rico and a humanitarian crisis for its people, McConnell said. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said he shared the concerns of many Democrats with the excessive powersand appointment structure of the oversight board, and he was unhappy with some labor provisions. But Reid said he was voting for passage because Puerto Rico needed the help by Friday. Otherwise we ... turn them over to the hedge funds and they will sue them to death, he said. The seven member board, appointed by President Obama from recommendations given by party leaders in both the House and Senate, is supposed to be in place by Sept. 1, 2016. Neither political party was entirely happy with the fix. Democrats bridled at a Republican provision that might lower the minimum wage for some young workers and weaken overtime pay rules while some Republicans were concerned the bill could amount to a bailout of the island, or set a precedent for states in fiscal trouble to seek a similar arrangement. Theyll say if a territory can receive unprecedented authority from Congress, then why shouldnt a state? asked Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa. The legislation is geared toward U.S. territories. Puerto Rico is not covered by current U.S. bankruptcy law under Chapter 9. Democratic Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, opposing the measure, argued that Friday was an arbitrary deadline for action that did not excuse a flawed bill. A vote for the bill was a vote to authorize an unelected, unchecked and all powerful control board to determine Puerto Ricos destiny for a generation or more, Menendez declared. Some senators, including Vermont independent Bernie Sanders, criticized the estimated $370 million cost of the legislation over five years, complaining that Puerto Rico will get stuck with the tab while it is struggling to reduce its debt. Sanders blasted this as colonialism at its worst. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which issued that estimate, said that about $350 million of the total would primarily cover fees of legal and financial consultants hired to restructure Puerto Ricos debt.

Obama concerned over longer term global growth after Brexit,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Wednesday he expects the world economy will be steady in the short run after Britains decision to leave the European Union but expressed concern about longer term global growth. Obama, appearing at a North American summit with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, said there have been reactions in markets, stock prices and currencies since last Thursdays so-called Brexit vote. Preparations by central banks, finance ministers and the U.S. treasury secretary helped ensure the global economy will hold steady in the short term, he said at a news conference. I think there are some genuine longer term concerns about global growth if in fact Brexit goes through and that freezes the possibilities of investment in Great Britain or in Europe as a whole, Obama said. At a time when global growth rates were weak already, this doesnt help. The U.S. president, who had openly sided with British Prime Minister David Cameron against Brexit, said the leaders of G20 nations, who will meet in China this year, will have to work to boost global demand and fortify the global economy.  Obama said that, while the special relationship between Britain and the United States will endure, that countrys absence from the EU would make it harder for us to solve some of the other challenges that have to be solved. He said his main message to Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders involved in the Brexit would be: Everybody should catch their breath, come up with a plan and a process that is orderly, thats transparent, that people understand and then proceed, understanding that both sides have a stake in getting this right. And I think that will be a difficult, challenging process but it does not need to be a panicky process. ",politicsNews,"June 29, 2016 ",1
Federal judge rules Ohio can purge inactive voters,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - A federal judge ruled on Wednesday that Ohios secretary of state was within his rights to strip thousands of inactive voters from the rolls, rejecting a legal challenge by civil liberties activists who claimed that the purge disenfranchised minorities and the poor. The decision by U.S. District Judge George C. Smith in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union could impact the presidential race in Ohio, a key swing state seen as potentially pivotal in the Nov. 8 election. No Republican has won the White House without carrying Ohio.  The ACLU charged in its lawsuit that Ohio Secretary of State John Husteds policy of removing from the rolls voters deemed inactive over a six-year period violated the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 because it targets minorities and lower-income voters who tend to favor Democrats. Smith disagreed, finding that the policy was not illegal because it removed voters from the rolls only after they failed to vote and then did not respond to a change of address confirmation. Ohios procedures of maintaining the voter registration rolls ensure the integrity of the election process, Smith wrote. Husted has said that the policy has been in place since the 1990s under both Republican and Democratic secretaries of state. While todays ruling reaffirms that the process Ohio has used for over two decades is constitutional and in line with state and federal law, the best news is that we can put another wasteful lawsuit behind us and focus on the important work of running elections in Ohio, Husted said in a statement.

"Obama: Trump's rhetoric is xenophobic, not populist","OTTAWA (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama is tired of hearing Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump described as a populist. The Democratic leader, who has made no secret of his dislike for the wealthy businessmans rhetoric, closed a news conference in Canada on Wednesday with a long riff on what makes a leader qualified for the populist mantra. Trump did not meet the criteria, Obama said, without mentioning the Republican by name. Somebody ... who has never shown any regard for workers, has never fought on behalf of social justice issues or making sure that poor kids are getting a decent shot at life or have health care, does not meet the definition, Obama said. They dont suddenly become a populist because they say something controversial in order to win votes. Thats not the measure of populism. Thats nativism, or xenophobia. Or worse. Or its just cynicism, he said. Trump won enough grassroots support among Republicans to make him the partys presumptive presidential nominee with a pledge to ban Muslims temporarily from entering the United States and to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, and a series of other inflammatory remarks. Obama has sharply criticized Trump for such rhetoric.  He plans to campaign with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, next week. The presidents latest criticism of Trump could foreshadow Obamas strategy to help Clinton on the campaign trail.  He made a point of saying U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clintons opponent in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, genuinely deserved the title of populist.  Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist and generated huge support from young people across the United States in his campaign. Clinton needs those supporters now, and Obama, who won the White House in 2008 and 2012 with a similar coalition, will try to help deliver them for her. Obama, who leaves office in January, made his comments on Wednesday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto looking on. Sorry, Obama said after his more-than-six-minute monologue. Its the prerogative of an outgoing president to go on an occasional rant, he said. ",politicsNews,"June 30, 2016 ",1
Trump's opposition to trade deals fuels internal party opposition,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday lashed out at the U.S. Chamber of Commerces scathing criticism of his stance on trade, highlighting divisions within the Republican Party that threaten unity ahead of the Nov. 8 election. At a campaign rally in Maine on Wednesday, Trump called the nations largest business association controlled totally by various groups of people who dont care about you whatsoever. He said new trade deals should be negotiated because foreign countries are taking advantage of America. Every country that we do business with us look at us as the stupid people with the penny bank, Trump said Wednesday at the rally in Bangor, Maine. The Washington-based lobbying group, which represents the United States largest companies and business interests, is typically a reliable backer of Republican policies.  But on Tuesday it took issue with Trumps vocal opposition to trade deals, calling his proposals dangerous ideas that would push the United States into another recession. Trump said the Chambers argument that his policies would cause a trade war were incorrect because the United States was already at a deficit.  Were already losing the trade war, we lost the trade war, Trump said. Nothing can happen worse than is happening now. In speeches on Tuesday, Trump called for renegotiating or scrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico, calling it a job killer, and reiterated opposition to the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership among the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries. He also lambasted Chinas trade and currency policies. The Chamber has consistently backed trade deals.      The public squabbling between the presumptive Republican nominee and the business group was unusual, one of a series of reminders that Trump still struggles to unite his party behind his campaign. The Republicans and many business leaders tend to share policy goals and work in lockstep, and many business leaders have traditionally been big donors to Republican candidates. So far, the Chambers political action committee has donated $134,000 to federal candidates or their committees, with $127,500 of that total going to Republicans, according to U.S. government campaign finance records. Billionaire Republican donor Paul Singer, who bankrolled an effort to try to defeat Trump during the campaigns nominating phase, said on Wednesday that a Trump presidency and his trade positions would almost certainly lead to a global depression. The most impactful of the economic policies that I recall him coming out for are these anti-trade policies, Singer said during a panel discussion at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado, according to CNBC. But opposing trade deals has proven a winning strategy for Trump among voters concerned about the loss of manufacturing jobs.  Art Laffer, an economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan who supports Trump, said he did not like the tone of Trumps speech on Tuesday but thought it was an improvement over his past comments on trade. Its not terribly alarming to me, Laffer said. I didnt see any 45 percent tariffs across the board. ... I saw negotiating better trade deals rather than throwing away all the trade deals we have now. He points out the flaws in these trades, and thats all true, Laffer said. I dont like the tone of it, but I dislike the tone less today than I did three weeks ago. Peter Navarro, a Trump trade policy adviser, defended the candidates position. Heres the central point to understand: The White House has been utterly and completely soft on Chinas illegal trade practices, said Navarro, a professor at the University of California, Irvine. The status quo is the worst of all possible worlds for the United States.  Trump also took fire from for his positions on trade from Democrats. In a call organized by rival Hillary Clintons presidential campaign, U.S. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a former businessman and tech entrepreneur, said that while the country needed to do a better job protecting workers, more resources should be put into training them for a new economy. He also noted that it was unusual to see a Republican standard-bearer and the Chamber divide.  Youve really got a special circumstance when the U.S. Chamber of Commerce responded to Trumps economic plan with a full-fledged onslaught, Warner said. No one could have predicted this kind of election season. Clinton held no public campaign events on Wednesday but did announce she would appear next week with President Barack Obama, the first time this year that he and his former Secretary of State have campaigned together.

I expect that our friends on both sides of the Channel will develop a workable plan for how to move forward, Obama said in a speech to the Canadian Parliament. ",politicsNews,"June 29, 2016 ",1
"U.S. farm groups discuss policy with Clinton staff, pursue Trump","CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. agriculture groups are pushing for continuing talks with the presumptive Democratic and Republican presidential nominees in an effort to influence their farm policy positions as a slump in crop prices squeezes the sectors profits. Representatives of about a dozen trade associations, including the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Farmers Union, met with staffers for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton on Friday at her New York campaign headquarters. It was the farm coalitions first meeting with Clintons staff and included discussions of issues ranging from agricultural trade and labor to mandatory labels for foods containing genetically modified ingredients, attendees said on Wednesday. The meeting was the start of a push by the sector for more details from Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump about their stances on issues affecting farmers and agribusiness. The groups are seeking a meeting with Trumps campaign. All of us agreed, on both sides of the table, that it is a successful meeting only if its the first of a number of exchanges, said Jay Vroom, the chief executive of pesticide association CropLife America, who attended the session. The candidates agriculture policies are crucial, the groups say, because net U.S. farm income is forecast to drop to its lowest since 2002, largely due to a decline in grain prices. If that happens, incomes will be down 56 percent from a recent high of $123.3 billion in 2013. With that kind of climate, were definitely concerned about what farm policy will look like building to the next (congressional) farm bill, said Tom Bryant, the National Farmers Unions membership director.     If elected, Clinton will increase agricultural production and profitability for family farms, spokesman Tyrone Gaylesaid. A Trump spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Matt Paul, a former U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesman working with Clintons campaign, participated in the meeting. The gathering came a day after Britains surprise vote to exit the European Union, which drew support from some regions with low population densities. Chandler Goule, incoming CEO of the National Association of Wheat Growers, said farm groups drew parallels to Britains referendum because its going to be rural America thats going to turn out for this election, thats actually going to determine the outcome of this (presidential) election. Now that Clinton and Trump are the presumed nominees, its time to start making more detailed and more in-the-weeds-type commitments, he said. ",politicsNews,"June 29, 2016 ",1
New rules give protesters more leeway at Republican convention,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday authorized a new plan allowing protesters at next months Republican National Convention in Cleveland to demonstrate in an area that will be readily visible to convention goers. The new plan, approved by U.S. District Judge Dan Aaron Polster, also cuts in half the size of an event zone where demonstrations and mobility will be limited and gives protesters more time to demonstrate. The agreement between the city of Cleveland and the American Civil Liberties Union resolves weeks of wrangling over the rules for what are expected to be lively protests when Donald Trump is due to become the Republican Partys official nominee for president at the July 18-21 convention. Trump campaign events have drawn raucous demonstrations,  with some resulting in clashes between his supporters and opponents. This settlement is a significant improvement from what the city had previously offered, Christine Link, executive director for the ACLU of Ohio, said in a statement. The ACLU sued on behalf of three groups planning to organize thousands of demonstrators, calling the rules too restrictive. Dan Williams, spokesman for Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson, described the changes as minor and said he did not believe there would be an increased security risk as a result. Cleveland originally planned to cordon off 3.3 square miles (8.5 square km) around the convention site as an event zone where free speech mobility would be limited.  After another federal judge struck down the citys original plan, the two sides settled the lawsuit on Friday and took several days to work out details before revealing the new plan. The event zone is now 1.7 square miles (4.4 square km). The new zone frees up parkland where demonstrators will be able to organize before their protests. It also removes the Port of Cleveland and a small public airport for corporate jets and air taxi services from the restricted area. The main parade route for demonstrators now extends deeper into central Cleveland and will be more visible from the sports arena where the main event will take place, and more within the view of delegates and the media. The previous route took demonstrators further away from the center of town and over a bridge where they would be seen primarily by themselves. In addition, groups were granted extra staging time between protests. The ACLU filed the lawsuit on behalf of Citizens for Trump, a Texas-based group that supports the businessmans campaign; Organize Ohio, a liberal activist group; and Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless, a charitable organization.

Facebook's political influence under a microscope,"(Reuters) - As the U.S. presidential campaign heats up, Facebook Inc is going out of its way to show its neutrality - an increasingly urgent matter for the social network as evidence of its power  continues to emerge. Recent studies have shown the site has extraordinary influence. According to research scheduled to be published in August in the Journal of Communication, when people tagged their friends on Facebook in voting reminders, turnout increased by 15 to 24 percent.  During U.S. presidential primary elections this year, a Facebook reminder that informed people when their states voter registration deadline was approaching and provided a link helped produce a surge of nearly 650,000 new voter registrations in California alone, according to Secretary of State Alex Padilla. In the United Kingdom, a Facebook reminder days before the deadline to register to vote on whether the country should exit the European Union led to 186,000 people registering online to vote, according to the government.  Generally, getting people out to vote could swing a national election, said Katherine Haenschen, a PhD student at the University of Texas, Austin and author of the upcoming Journal of Communications study. Facebook is eager to show that its political involvement is limited to seemingly neutral activities such as encouraging voting. The company this week released some of the guidelines that govern its all-important News Feed - the place most people see postings on Facebook - and has pushed back hard against recent allegations of political bias in its Trending Topics module. At the same time Facebook has embraced its role as a new town hall for politics, hosting events and helping candidates more effectively leverage their platforms, said Katie Harbath, Facebooks global politics and government outreach director Her team helps candidates by answering their questions and providing advice, such as how to use Facebook Live and how to increase engagement on their pages.   Still, concerns about Facebooks role in shaping political attitudes are unlikely to abate anytime soon. Some people object even to voter-registration drives. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, for example, alleged this week that Google and Facebook were trying to encourage a remain vote in Britains referendum on European Union membership by encouraging voting, asserting that media users are disproportionately youthful and pro-Europe.    A more common complaint is that Facebook and other social networks serve as an echo chamber of ideas and beliefs, as users decide which people and pages they will follow and customize their News Feed.   A 2015 study in Science showed that Facebook users tended to interact and click on content that was more in line with their ideological views.  Facebook customer Tom Steinberg wrote in a post this week -one that quickly spread over Twitter - that he had actively looked on Facebook for people celebrating Britains vote to exit the European Union last week but could not find any.  Steinberg, who said he was in favor of remaining in the European Union, urged tech leaders to do more to address the echo chamber on social media.  To not act on this problem now is tantamount to actively supporting and funding the tearing apart of the fabric of our societies, Steinberg wrote. Were getting countries where one half just doesnt know anything at all about the other.  Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management for News Feed, said the team tries to help users find new pages to follow, though he did not cite any specific efforts aimed at encouraging people to diversify their feeds.

The bill cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the Senate on Wednesday morning, and has already passed the House of Representatives.

Biden outlines 'Moonshot' initiatives to fight cancer,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden on Wednesday announced plans as part of the administrations Cancer Moonshot initiative, aimed at speeding development of treatments by cutting bureaucracy and easing collaboration between scientists, industry, patients and government. Speaking at a cancer summit at Howard University in Washington, Biden made an impassioned plea for increased urgency in the fight against cancer. The event was part of a national day of action involving hundreds of researchers, patient advocates and data experts across the country. Bidens son Beau died last year at age 46 from brain cancer, something Biden said helps inform his passion for the project.  I believe we can do in the next five years what would normally take 10 years, he said. Time matters, days matter, minutes matter. Among proposals intended to bypass inefficiency at the federal level, he announced the formation of an Oncology Center of Excellence at the Food and Drug Administration, which will coordinate and review all of FDA cancer treatments. It comes as scientific advances in diagnostics allow for greater tailoring of drugs to an individuals genetic profile. It is the first of four potential centers proposed under a bill moving through Congress. Under the existing review system, companies submit products to different divisions of the agency depending on whether it is a drug, device or biologic, a drug made from living cells. A treatment that combines a drug and a diagnostic device could get reviewed on different timelines. We are moving into a very complicated area in oncology where drugs and devices and biologics are going to be used in combination or sequentially, Dr. Richard Pazdur, the FDAs cancer drug director, said in an interview. Pazdur will oversee the establishment of the center and act as its director for the next 120 days, with the potential for the position to be renewed. He will report directly to FDA Commissioner Robert Califf. The Cancer Moonshot initiative was announced by President Barack Obama at his State of the Union address in January. Biden outlined a slew of other collaborations and initiatives, including making it easier for patients to find and enter clinical trials through the creation of a cancer trials website and making it easier for scientists to focus on research and less on raising money. We have to change the culture that turns scientists into grant writers, he said. We have to reward teamwork. ",politicsNews,"June 29, 2016 ",1

"U.S. lawmakers seek more money, authority for derivatives regulator","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission would have stronger policing powers over the derivatives market, along with a boosted budget, under legislation introduced in the U.S. Congress on Wednesday. The bill, introduced by Democrats Elizabeth Warren and Mark Warner in the Senate and Elijah Cummings in the House of Representatives, also would add new tasks to the regulators rulemaking agenda. The only way to make sure that derivatives can never lead to a financial crisis and taxpayer bailouts again is to put in place clearer rules and stronger oversight, Warren said in a statement.  The bill likely will fizzle in the Republican-led Congress. It could also become part of this years election fights, as the relationship between Wall Street and Washington frequently moves to center stage in presidential and congressional campaigns.   Democrats such as Warren, who is campaigning for her partys presumptive nominee, Hillary Clinton, regard the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law passed after the 2007-09 financial crisis as crucial for preventing another massive meltdown. That law greatly expanded the CFTCs reach, as swaps and derivatives had played a key role in the breakdown of banks and other firms. They also seek further regulation, saying vulnerabilities persist in the financial system. The presumptive nominee for the Republican Party, real estate developer and television star Donald Trump wants to repeal Dodd-Frank. Many in the party say the law has gone too far, drying up liquidity and freezing capital. The proposed legislation gives the CFTC a stable funding stream and the tools necessary to help deter future illegal acts by permitting penalties large enough to impact the bottom lines of even the largest financial firms, Cummings said. The CFTC currently is funded through annual appropriations from Congress, unlike the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is backed by user fees and fines.  CFTC Chair Timothy Massad has sought a change, saying millions of dollars more in funds would help the agency keep up with technology advancements in the markets it oversees and with high-powered defense teams in its enforcement cases. Republicans in Congress say the funding process keeps the agency accountable to elected leaders. The Democrats bill would move the CFTC to the same model as the SEC. It would also put certain foreign exchange swaps under CFTC jurisdiction, change how derivatives are treated in bankruptcy, require posting initial margin in inter-affiliate swaps, and require regulators to review derivatives clearinghouses.

Puerto Rico debt bill gains backers in U.S. Senate; close vote seen,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration and U.S. Senate Republican leaders scrambled on Tuesday to garner enough support to get a Puerto Rico debt relief bill through a critical procedural vote set for Wednesday which several lawmakers predicted would be close. After months of waiting for Congress to act as Puerto Ricos economic crisis progressively worsened, the Caribbean island appeared to be on the verge of securing a relief plan from Washington aimed at helping it address a hobbling $70 billion debt. The leaders of both political parties in the Senate are on board, but the outcome appeared uncertain. The Obama administration sent Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to try to persuade recalcitrant Democrats, while Republicans heard arguments for the legislation from fellow senators at a closed-door luncheon. We will win the vote tomorrow, said Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, as he left the meeting with Lew. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, told reporters he was very much on board, and was urging Republicans to back the measure establishing a federal oversight board to be in charge of restructuring the U.S. territorys debt. Im hopeful and optimistic that the (Obama) administration will be able to get Democrats on board, and we believe strongly that its an approach that appeals to most Republicans, McConnell said. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said he would support the bill. The Senate Democratic whip, Dick Durbin of Illinois, a recent convert to the proposal, said he was trying to get a majority of Democrats to back it.  House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi added that while there is much to the legislation she objected to, she implored her Senate colleagues to adopt the bill. Failure to pass this bill would be a tremendous win for the unscrupulous hedge funds that have held this bill up for six months demanding to be first in line over the needs of the people of Puerto Rico, she said. Unless Congress acts, our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico will be plunged into deep economic turmoil in just three days time. Puerto Ricos 3.5 million residents are U.S. citizens. The U.S. territory is reeling from a 45 percent poverty rate, a steady flow of outward migration to the U.S. mainland that further shrinks its tax base and the shuttering of essential services. But Durbin predicted it will be close Wednesday morning, when the Puerto Rico debt relief bill will need a supermajority of 60 senators votes to stay alive in the Senate.  And despite McConnells expression of optimism, other Republicans said the leadership appeared worried behind the scenes. I think leadership is concerned because theyre really whipping it, said Senator Dean Heller, a Nevada Republican. When they whipped me last night, I said no. So theyre coming back and asking if Ill reconsider. The White House joined the fray, with spokesman Josh Earnest saying that without action by Congress to help Puerto Rico deal with its debt, the need for a bailout of the U.S. territory will become more likely. The measure is identical to the plan passed by the House of Representatives earlier this month, as Congress tries to send it to President Barack Obama to sign into law by July 1. That is when Puerto Rico faces a potential default on a chunk of its debt if it cannot make $1.9 billion in payments.  If the Wednesday morning procedural vote is successful, it would clear the measure for passage this week.  But Republican skeptics of the bill are worried it could constitute a bailout - something its supporters deny - while Democrats have expressed concern about the composition of the oversight board and labor provisions that they say could lower minimum wages for young workers in Puerto Rico. The top Democrat on the Senate Finance committee, Oregons Ron Wyden, announced Tuesday he would back the legislation. But Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown appeared to be wavering even after meeting with Lew, Wyden and other Democrats in a Senate office building.  Brown said he would be more likely to vote yes in Wednesdays procedural vote if Senate leaders promise him a vote on an unrelated issue - legislation to ensure that the federal government and coal mine operators honor payment of promised pensions and health benefits to retired miners. Lew said he thought there was  broad understanding of the urgency. I just do not believe that we can let three and a half million Americans descend into chaos, he said.

Hispanic claims victory in Harlem race to replace Rangel in U.S. Congress,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dominican-born Adriano Espaillat claimed victory on Tuesday in the U.S. congressional race to succeed longtime Representative Charles Rangel, signaling change in the historically black neighborhood of Harlem that has grown increasingly Hispanic. Nine Democrats ran in the primary to select the partys candidate for Novembers general election. In a district where Democratic voters heavily outnumber Republicans, Tuesdays winner will have a virtual lock on taking Rangels vacated seat in the House of Representatives. Espaillat, once an illegal immigrant, would be the first Dominican-American member of Congress. A state senator, Espaillat, held a 3-point lead on state Assemblyman Keith Wright, an African-American who was endorsed by Rangel and benefited from the political machine of a man who held the job for 46 years. With 98 percent of polling places reporting, Espaillat had 36.7 percent of the vote compared with 33.7 percent for Wright, a difference of nearly 1,300 votes. The voters of the 13th congressional district made history tonight, Espaillat, 61, said in a victory speech. The voters ... elected a country boy from Santiago de los Caballeros in the Dominican Republic, he said, mixing Spanish and English. Wright, however, refused to concede, telling supporters: No candidate can declare victory tonight, not until every vote is counted. The district is dominated by Harlem, long a leading cultural center, home to black political and commercial life, and an incubator for jazz.  Harlem notably has grown more white with gentrification, but it also has become more Hispanic. Besides Harlem, the district also includes predominantly Latino neighborhoods further to the north where Espaillat has his base. Rangel, 86, a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, won his first congressional election in 1970, and since then Harlem voters routinely returned him to office every two years, even after his 2010 censure for ethics violations.  Espaillat tried and failed to unseat Rangel in 2012 and 2014 primary elections. Gentrification emerged as a leading issue in the campaign, as a decade-long influx of affluent people, many of them white, has transformed Harlems once-blighted blocks of 19th century brownstone town houses. Change has muted the distinctive black identity of the area, the home of the Apollo Theater, the Cotton Club and other monuments of African-American culture. Once an upscale Dutch neighborhood named after the city near Amsterdam, Harlem drew African-Americans during the northward migration of former slaves in the late 19th Century and again between the world wars.  In decades past, affluent New Yorkers avoided venturing too far north, or uptown. But soaring property values have turned Harlem into one of New Yorks trendiest real estate markets.

"VW agrees to buy back diesel vehicles, fund clean air efforts","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - German automaker Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) will pay as much as $15.3 billion after admitting it cheated on U.S. diesel emissions tests for years, agreeing to buy back vehicles from consumers and provide funding that could benefit makers of cleaner technologies. The largest-ever automotive buyback offer in the United States came in a deal announced on Tuesday by the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, Environmental Protection Agency and California state regulators. The proposed consent decree confirmed that VW will set aside $10.033 billion to cover buybacks or fixes for diesel cars and sport utility vehicles that used illegal software to defeat government emissions tests. VW admitted in September that it installed secret software that allowed U.S. vehicles to emit up to 40 times legally allowable pollution. VW still may face criminal charges and oversight by an independent monitor, a person briefed on the matter said. A criminal settlement could include measures to ensure VW would not engage in further cheating. Shares of VW rose as much as 5 percent on Tuesday, and closed up 1.7 percent at 107.85 euros. We didnt follow a multiyear, grind-it-out litigation strategy, which would have been counterproductive for Volkswagen, said Robert Giuffra Jr., VWs lead lawyer.  We moved with lightning speed to settle with our federal and state regulators and the private plaintiffs.    Under the Justice Department deal, VW will provide $2 billion over 10 years to fund programs directed by California and EPA to promote construction of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, development of zero-emission ride-sharing fleets and other efforts to boost sales of cars that do not burn petroleum. VW also agreed to put up $2.7 billion over three years to enable government and tribal agencies to replace old buses or to fund infrastructure to reduce diesel emissions. The settlement covers 475,000 2.0-liter diesel Jetta, Beetle, Audi A3, Golf, and Passat vehicles from the 2009-2015 model years. VW also announced a separate settlement with 44 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico that will cost at least $600 million, bringing the total to as much as $15.3 billion. Deputy U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates said a criminal investigation remained active. Were looking at multiple companies and multiple individuals, she said. By duping regulators, Volkswagen turned nearly half a million American drivers into unwitting accomplices in an unprecedented assault on our environment, she added. The EPA is investigating other automakers for potential emissions problems. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said the agency will be releasing information as it becomes available. VW still faces criminal investigations in Germany and other countries, and lawsuits from investors around the world. The company planned a multi-billion-euro investment program to introduce more than 30 fully electric cars by 2025. Owners have until late 2018 to decide whether to sell the vehicles back.  The deals would move VW close to the 16.2 billion euros ($18 billion) it has set aside to cover costs of the scandal. But spending on buybacks could be much less if regulators approve fixes and owners opt for repairs. Most owners will get $5,100 to $10,000 in compensation, including the pre-scandal value of the cars, documents filed on Tuesday said. The company expects to begin buying back vehicles in October, when a U.S. judge is expected to give final approval to the settlements, and is to start proposing fixes in November.  VW cannot resell or export vehicles it buys back unless the EPA approves a fix, the documents said. Volkswagen must repair or buy back 85 percent of the 475,000 vehicles by June 2019 or face penalties of $100 million for every percentage point below that figure. The agreement does not lift a ban on sales by VW of its U.S. 2016 diesel vehicles. Nor does it cover fees for lawyers of owners suing the company or address 80,000 larger polluting 3.0 liter Porsche, Audi and VW diesel cars.  VW could also face billions in additional costs if it is forced to buy back the 3.0 liter vehicles. VW will likely face significant yet-to-be determined fines under the U.S. Clean Air Act for emissions violations. The settlement does not resolve lawsuits filed last year by owners against German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH, which was accused of conspiring with Volkswagen to evade emissions standards.

Important to look at individuals in VW scandal: Lynch,"PHOENIX (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Tuesday that it was important for the Justice Department to look at individuals in the ongoing criminal investigation into the Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) emissions scandal. Asked whether she would like to see company executives held accountable for the companys wrongdoing, Lynch told Reuters:  Whats important for us in every case, including this case,  is to look at those individuals and see what if anything will be  resolved with regards to them.         Under a settlement announced on Tuesday, the German automaker will pay as much as $15.3 billion after admitting it cheated on U.S. diesel emissions tests for years, agreeing to buy back vehicles from consumers and provide funding that could benefit makers of cleaner technologies. Lynch said U.S. justice officials will be looking at everyone involved in the making of VW decisions in the emissions scandal.        Certainly it relates to every case, that when it comes to corporate wrongdoing whether it is civil or criminal, that the Department of Justice will be looking at everyone who was involved in making those decisions and in implementing the actions that led to the liability that we have found, she said in an interview in Phoenix. VW admitted in September that it installed secret software that allowed U.S. vehicles to emit up to 40 times legally allowable pollution. ",politicsNews,"June 28, 2016 ",1
Exclusive: Trump supporters more likely to view blacks negatively - Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Supporters of U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump are more likely to describe African Americans as criminal, unintelligent, lazy and violent than voters who backed some Republican rivals in the primaries or who support Democratic contender Hillary Clinton, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll. Ahead of the Nov. 8 election to replace Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, the poll also showed significant numbers of Americans in both the Republican and Democratic parties view blacks more negatively than whites, harbor anxiety about living in diverse neighborhoods and are concerned that affirmative action policies discriminate against whites. Republicans in the survey expressed these concerns to a greater degree than Democrats, with Trump supporters presenting the most critical views of blacks. The poll, conducted between March and June, interviewed 16,000 Americans and included 21 questions on attitudes about race. It sought responses from voters who support Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, and her rival U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. It also surveyed supporters of U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich, the last two Republican candidates to drop out of the race. Mr. Trump is an egalitarian who believes in supporting and protecting all people equally, said Stephen Miller, Trumps senior policy adviser, when asked about the poll.This is a stark contrast to Hillary Clinton, whose policies have been a disaster for African-American and Hispanic citizens. A spokesman for Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the poll. (Graphic on racial attitudes of presidential candidates' supporters tmsnrt.rs/294chjP) Nearly half of Trumps supporters described African Americans as more violent than whites. The same proportion described African Americans as more criminal than whites, while 40 percent described them as more lazy than whites. In smaller, but still significant, numbers, Clinton backers also viewed blacks more critically than whites with regard to certain personality traits. Nearly one-third of Clinton supporters described blacks as more violent and criminal than whites, and one-quarter described them as more lazy than whites. Clinton is relying heavily on black voters to help her win the White House, and her victory over Sanders in the early state nominating contests was due in part to her overwhelming lead among African Americans. When asked about where they wanted to live, 36 percent of Trump supporters said, I prefer to live in a community with people who come from diverse cultures, compared with 46 percent of Cruz supporters, 55 percent of Kasich supporters and 70 percent of Clinton supporters. Trumps supporters were more likely to be critical of affirmative action policies that favor minorities in school admissions or in hiring. Some 31 percent of Trump supporters said they strongly agree that social policies, such as affirmative action, discriminate unfairly against white people, compared with 21 percent of Cruz supporters, 17 percent of Kasich supporters and 16 percent of Clinton supporters. To be sure, not all Trump supporters expressed negative attitudes about blacks. No more than 50 percent of his supporters rated blacks negatively, relative to whites, on any of the six character traits in the poll. Yet when their answers to the poll questions were compared with responses from supporters of other candidates, Trump supporters were always more critical of blacks on personality traits, analysis of the results showed.  The trend was consistent in the data, even when the results were filtered to include only white respondents to remove any impact that a different racial mix between Clinton and Trump supporters might play in the poll. The Trump supporters views on affirmative action and neighborhood diversity do not necessarily reflect racial bias alone, saidMichael Traugott, a polling expert and professor emeritus at the University of Michigan, who is not publicly supporting either Trump or Clinton. Rather, the results could also suggest anxieties about economic insecurity and social standing.  Trump, whose supporters are mostly white, has promised to return manufacturing jobs to the United States, crack down on illegal immigration and pull out of global trade deals that he says have hurt American workers.  The support for Trump is indicative of the support for the type of policies he is advocating, said Lawrence Brown, a professor at Morgan State University in Baltimore who writes about racism and has supported Sanders. Obama said in May that U.S. race relations have improved over the last three decades but that significant work still needs to be done.  The issue of race has assumed great political prominence over the past two years, amid countrywide protests over police treatment of African Americans, economic disparity between blacks and whites, and court challenges to affirmative action and voting rights. The Reuters/Ipsos poll asked people to grade whites and blacks on a series of personal traits. The results were then analyzed to compare how each respondent rated whites with how they rated blacks. In nearly every case, Trump supporters were more likely to rate whites higher than blacks when their responses were compared with responses from Clinton supporters.  For example, 32 percent of Trump supporters placed whites closer to the top level of intelligence than they did blacks, compared with 22 percent of Clinton supporters who did the same. About 40 percent of Trump supporters placed whites higher on the hardworking scale than blacks, while 25 percent of Clinton supporters did the same. And 44 percent of Trump supporters placed whites as more well mannered than blacks, compared with 30 percent of Clinton supporters. The online poll, which surveyed people over the age of 18 across the United States, was conducted during two periods in the 2016 election cycle. The first ran three weeks in March and April, while Cruz and Kasich were still competing with Trump for the Republican nomination. The second polling period covered nearly four weeks in May and June, after Kasich and Cruz had dropped out. ",politicsNews,"June 28, 2016 ",1
"Trump vows to reopen, or toss, NAFTA pact with Canada and Mexico","MONESSEN, Pennsylvania/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday vowed to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate the NAFTA trade agreement with the United States if elected, as part of an effort to protect and restore American jobs. Trump criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement as a U.S. job killer, saying he would be willing to scrap the pact if Canada and Mexico were unwilling to budge. He also tried to link Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to the deal on the eve of a meeting in Ottawa of the three amigos, the leaders of the three NAFTA signatories: the United States, Mexico and Canada.  In his most detailed speech on trade, the presumptive Republican nominee said he would pull the United States out of negotiations for a deal among 12 Pacific Rim nations and promised to use executive power to resolve trade disputes with China. Trump also pledged to revive the U.S. steel and aluminum industry, speaking at an aluminum scrap company in Monessen, Pennsylvania, nearly 30 miles (50 km) south of Pittsburgh, the one-time American steelmaking capital. Trump has identified Pennsylvania as a state he believes he can wrest from the Democrats in the Nov. 8 election. He also campaigned on Tuesday in Ohio, which like Pennsylvania is a Rust Belt state.  Democratic President Barack Obama won both states in 2008 and 2012, but manufacturing job losses have led to voter anxiety in the region. Im going tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers. And I dont mean just a little bit better, I mean a lot better, Trump said in Pennsylvania. If Canada and Mexico do not agree to renegotiate the pact, Trump said he would notify them under the agreements terms that America intends to withdraw from the deal. He tried to tie his Democratic rival to the pact, approved in 1993 during the administration of her husband, President Bill Clinton, as he called NAFTA one of the worst legacies of the Clinton years. On MSNBC after Trumps speech, Clinton spokeswoman Kristina Schake called the wealthy New York businessman the king of outsourcing, in an apparent reference to Trump-branded products such as suits and ties made overseas.  It was full of hypocrisy and misstatements and outright lies, Schake said. Trade has been a vulnerability for Clinton, who struggled for white, blue-collar votes in her Democratic primary race against U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who criticized her for supporting trade deals and said she was too close to Wall Street.   TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP Trump echoed Sanders criticism on Tuesday, saying Clinton supported the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, while she was secretary of state and only opposed it once she was running for president. Clintons campaign said she opposed the agreement because it was not strong enough on currency manipulation and other areas.        Clinton has said she will evaluate each trade deal on its merits but does not believe the TPP is good for U.S. workers.        Sanders now says he will vote for Clinton in November, although he has not formally withdrawn from the race. Trump said he saw no way to fix the TPP, calling it a death blow for American manufacturing. Although China is not part of the agreement, Trump said Beijing might try to enter it through the back door later on. Later, during a rally in St. Clairsville, Ohio, Trump said the deal was just a continuing rape of our country. Just hours before Trump spoke, Clinton allies sought to pre-empt the planned trade speech by saying Trumps policies amounted to empty promises. Earlier, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told a trade conference in Washington that Trump embodies everything that is wrong with our current trade policy. He has consistently sent American jobs overseas to line his own pockets. The AFL-CIO, which collectively represents more than 12 million workers, making it the largest U.S. labor federation, endorsed Clinton this month. Both Clinton and Trump have acknowledged that Britains vote to leave the European Union signaled a global economic frustration among working-class voters that could reverberate in the U.S. election. There is a lot of legitimate anxiety, fear and even anger in many parts of our country because people feel like the economy has failed them, Clinton said in Denver on Tuesday. I think this is going to be one of the defining issues in this election. Trump has seized on the historic Brexit vote to bolster his argument that voters are rising up against establishment leaders, saying Americans would reject the global elite and support his presidential candidacy. But Trump has broken with Republican Party orthodoxy in criticizing trade deals, and has threatened to slap tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports. His rhetoric has drawn criticism from many economists, who say such practices could spark trade wars. As Trump spoke, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is usually in sync with prominent Republicans on trade policy, said on Twitter: Under Trumps trade plans, we would see higher prices, fewer jobs, and a weaker economy.

Justice Dept. reviewing Supreme Court immigration decision: Lynch,"PHOENIX (Reuters) - The Obama administration is looking into whether it can challenge the Supreme Courts decision to block President Barack Obamas plan to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Tuesday.         We will be reviewing the case and seeing what, if anything else, we need to do in court, Lynch told Reuters in an interview.  Lynch did not say what legal options the Obama administration may pursue following a split decision by the Supreme Court justices last week that left in place a block on the executive action by a lower court.  She said any future executive actions Obama may take on immigration would be left to the White House.  In a wideranging interview on topics from gun control to the effect of the planned exit of Britain from the European Union, Lynch identified espionage from foreign nationals on U.S. companies as a tremendous problem. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has reported a 53 percent increase in cases of economic espionage between 2014 and 2015 and the majority of cases involve Chinese nationals as culprits.  Most recently, Xu Jiaqiang, 30, was charged with economic espionage and theft of trade secrets, for stealing software source code from his U.S. employer with the intent of benefiting the Chinese government.  It is a matter of priority for us, Lynch said. When companies or industries are preyed upon by others, be they individuals, be they state actors who literally steal the fruit of their intellectual labors, essentially they are stealing from future generations also. Asked to comment on the impact of Britains decision at a referendum last week to leave the European Union, Lynch said the law enforcement relationships between the United States and both Britain and the European Union would remain strong.  We have very strong and positive relationship with law enforcement in the United Kingdom and, as of now, I do not see that changing in respect to the United Kingdom or the European Union, Lynch said.  Asked about changes that should be made in the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando on June 12, Lynch did not say if the Justice Department or the Obama administration was working on more executive actions on gun control but would continue research on smart-gun technology. A smart gun is one that can only be fired by the authorized user, often by requiring a palm print, in order to prevent gun theft or accidental shootings.      Thats going to be a longer-term project. One of the things that we want to make sure is that people who do own guns lawfully have a way to make sure that their family members are safe in the house with them, Lynch said the Justice Department is looking to see if the federal government can move smart-gun research forward, including on technology that can be used by the military. Lynch also said that it was important for the Justice Department to look at individuals in the ongoing criminal investigation into the Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) emissions scandal.

Clinton leads Trump by 11 points in U.S. presidential race: Reuters/Ipsos,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton posted an 11 percentage point lead over her Republican rival Donald Trump, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, a small decline since late last week. The June 24-28 poll showed that 45.3 percent of likely American voters support Clinton while 34.1 percent support Trump, and another 20.5 percent support neither. Clintons lead was 14 points on Friday, though she has generally been widening her advantage over the New York real estate magnate since mid-May, when the two were nearly tied. The former secretary of state, senator and first lady was bolstered in recent days by endorsements from members of the Republican establishment, including Henry Paulson, Treasury secretary under former President George W. Bush. Her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, said last week he would vote for her to stop Trump even though his campaign said this was not a formal endorsement. Clinton is struggling to win over Sanders supporters after a hard-fought campaign for the nomination. Critics have assailed her over her handling of emails and a 2012 attack on a U.S. mission in Libya while secretary of state. Trump got a brief boost in the days after the June 12 mass shooting in Florida, coming within nine points of Clinton as he fine-tuned a campaign promise to temporarily ban the entry of Muslim immigrants to shore up national security. His level of support so far in June, however, lags behind what his predecessor, Republican White House hopeful Mitt Romney, received in the same period in 2012.  He has sparred with Republican leaders over his off-the-cuff rhetoric and lagged behind Clintons campaign organization in both size and fundraising, worrying some of his allies.  The poll included 1,099 likely voters and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3.4 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"June 28, 2016 ",1
"Sanders back in U.S. Senate, blasts 'colonialism' in Puerto Rico","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders brought his firebrand rhetoric back to the floor of the Senate on Tuesday to condemn a White House-backed bill on Puerto Ricos financial crisis as colonialism at its worst. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who turned an unlikely presidential bid into a political movement to combat inequality, warned that legislation due for a crucial Senate vote on Wednesday would subject Puerto Rico to Republican trickle-down economics and favor vulture capitalists at the expense of the islands increasingly impoverished population. An aide said it was the first time Sanders has spoken in the Senate since December. Does that sound like the kind of morality that should be passed here in the United States Senate? Sanders fumed during an eight-minute appearance to support an hours-long speech by Democratic Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, who opposes the bill. The Vermont senator used his appearance to rail against details of the legislation, which would put much of Puerto Ricos management in the hands of a seven-member oversight board and require the island to pay $370 million over five years for the boards administration costs even as it cuts funding for education, healthcare and pensions. In an exchange with Menendez, Sanders said, How in Gods name do you run up an administrative cost of $370 million, adding, I know this sounds so absurd that people may think Im misleading them. Would my friend from New Jersey agree that this is colonialism at its worst? asked Sanders, who announced last week that he would vote for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in her November election contest against Republican Donald Trump. Oh absolutely, replied Menendez. The Puerto Rico bill, which has already been passed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, faces opposition from both sides of the aisle in the Senate. Nevertheless, the Obama administration and Republican leaders are trying to get the bill passed before a July 1 deadline, when the island is scheduled to make a $1.9 billion payment on its $70 billion debt.

Cruz chairs contentious U.S. Senate hearing on 'radical Islam',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Ted Cruz on Tuesday accused the Obama administration of under-emphasizing the threat of radical Islam as he presided over a Senate hearing for the second time since suspending his presidential campaign in early May. President Barack Obama and top Justice Department officials have come under fire from conservatives for avoiding the term radical Islam when denouncing attacks by violent extremists who claim inspiration from Islamic State, such as the Orlando nightclub shooter.  Administration officials have countered that focusing on the use of the phrase is a political distraction and gives fuel to Islamic State propagandists who say the United States has waged war against all of Islam. Absent from Tuesdays hearing before a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee were the two top Justice Department counter-terrorism officials whom Cruz had invited to testify. The Obama administration of course has declined to appear and explain its policies, Cruz said at the hearing, noting that the officials had not provided any reason for staying away. Justice Department spokesman Marc Raimondi said in an emailed statement that the department is focused on aggressively and successfully pursuing terrorist adversaries and on denying them unchallenged recruiting platforms to spread their messages of hate and intolerance. Democratic members of the subcommittee said national security policies more targeted at Muslims, such as presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps call for a ban on Muslim immigrants, would be unconstitutional and counter-productive. We cannot fight radicalization with further radicalization, said Democratic Senator Christopher Coons of Delaware, adding at the end of the hearing that he did not think arguing over semantics for three hours had helped improve American national security. Experts from Muslim and Arab advocacy groups as well as former government national security officials testified at the hearing, representing both sides of the debate over whether the administration emphasizes Islam too much or too little in its counter-extremism policies. Protesters with Code Pink, an anti-war advocacy group, offered Cruz packs of gum labeled Islamophobin as he entered the hearing room, telling him it could cure Islamophobia.

Congressional watchdog expands probe of lax Wall Street oversight,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional watchdog said on Tuesday it has formally added three agencies to its investigation into whether government regulators are too soft on the banks they are meant to police. In March, Reuters exclusively reported that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) was preparing a probe of the U.S. Federal Reserve and other to-be-determined regulators, in response to a request by Democratic U.S. Representatives Maxine Waters and Al Green for it to look into regulatory capture.  The review, requested last October, is the first by an outside agency into the perception that financial regulators are captured by and too deferential toward the bankers they supervise, so that Wall Street benefits at the publics expense. Lawrance Evans, director of the GAOs financial markets and community investment division, said in an email on Tuesday that the probe would include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). The GAO will also look back at work by the Office of Thrift Supervision, which merged with the OCC in 2011, and regulates savings and loan institutions.  Evans said the investigation is technically separate from the probe of the Fed, but it is indeed part of the work we are doing in response to the Waters/Green request.  The FDIC declined to comment. Representatives from the OCC and NCUA were not immediately available to comment.  Perceptions of regulatory capture have dogged the U.S. central bank and other regulators since they failed to head off the 2007-2009 financial crisis that sparked a global recession.

Clinton rolls out wide-ranging technology agenda,"(Reuters) - Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Tuesday laid out a technology and innovation agenda ranging from connecting every U.S. household to high-speed internet by 2020 to beefing up cyber security and reducing regulatory barriers. A statement issued by her campaign said Clinton strongly supports the Obama administrations net neutrality rules requiring broadband providers to treat all data equally, rather than giving or selling access to a so-called Web fast lane. She will increase research and development budgets of the National Science Foundation and similar entities and will launch an initiative to train up to 50,000 computer science teachers, the statement said. Hillary believes the government has an important role to play in laying a foundation for broad-based innovation and economic growth - by reducing regulatory barriers to entry, promoting healthy competition, and keeping the internet free and open, it said.

"U.S. official sees progress against Islamic State, war continuing","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obamas special envoy for the fight against Islamic State said on Tuesday that coalition forces were making progress and planning assaults on key cities in Iraq and Syria, but U.S. lawmakers criticized the progress as too slow. Brett McGurk testified at a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations hearing that morale is falling within the militant group as it loses territory. But he said efforts to find a political solution were making little progress and could not predict an end to fighting as long as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad remained in power. So long as Assad is leading the government in Damascus there is no way this war will ever end, McGurk said. The conflict between U.S.-backed armed groups and Assads government, supported by Russia and Iran, has complicated the fight against Islamic State amid a massive humanitarian crisis. Iraqi forces recently entered the Islamic State bastion of Falluja just west of Baghdad, and were pushing north toward Mosul, by far the biggest city that Islamic State controls. In Syria, U.S.-backed forces were closing in on the militant stronghold of Manbij, and Assads Russian-backed army has advanced into the province surrounding the de facto Islamic State capital Raqqa. McGurk said completion of the operation against Manbij would create conditions to move on Raqqa. And he said planning was under way for a campaign to liberate Mosul. Were beginning to totally isolate their presence in Raqqa and Mosul and I believe we are setting the conditions in place to get them out of both of these cities, McGurk said. He offered no timeline for those operations. Lawmakers said they felt the campaign was moving too slowly, and worried that, without a political solution, defeating Islamic State would leave behind a power vacuum that could be filled by another militant group. I dont see how whats left of the political process possibly leads to Assads departure, said Republican Senator Bob Corker, the committees chairman. A massacre two weeks ago in Florida by a gunman inspired by Islamic State drew attention to its efforts to inspire attacks in the west.   McGurk said Raqqa was the center for the groups social media operations, which have become more of a focus as its fortunes have faded on the battlefield. Discussing the region, McGurk said Washington would like more air resources from coalition allies United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Right now we want to end the war in Yemen in order to really focus efforts on the counter-ISIL campaign, McGurk said, using an acronym for Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS.

U.S. lawmakers deadlock on Zika virus funds,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers deadlocked over funding to fight the Zika virus on Tuesday, as Senate Democrats blocked a Republican proposal they said fell short of the challenge posed by the mosquito-borne virus and hurt other health priorities. Amid political recriminations by both parties, the Republican plan to provide $1.1 billion in funding to combat Zika, which had already passed the House of Representatives, failed to get the 60 votes needed in the Senate to clear a procedural hurdle. The vote was 52 in favor and 48 against on a mostly party-line vote.  It was unclear when Congress would revisit the issue. Democrats urged bipartisan talks, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said lawmakers would address the matter again sometime after the July 4 national holiday next week. Both sides warned the other that there could be a political price to pay in an election year for stalling on Zika funding, with the summer mosquito season under way and with it the threat of the virus spreading. Here we are, in an utterly absurd position, playing political games as this public health crisis mounts here in our country, McConnell said. The Zika virus, which has swept through the Americas and Caribbean since last fall, has been linked to thousands of cases of microcephaly, a rare birth defect, in Brazil, as well as to neurological disorders. It has been declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization. There have not yet been any cases reported of local transmission of the Zika virus in the continental United States, but there have been 820 cases that were acquired from travel to areas with active Zika outbreaks, or through sexual transmission. There have been more than 1,800 cases of Zika infection reported in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory in the Caribbean. Health experts expect local transmission to occur in the continental United States with warmer weather. Democrats have been urging Republicans for months to agree to Zika funding. The Republican plan would have funded mosquito control efforts by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, as well as vaccine research by the National Institutes of Health, and money for community health centers in areas that are experiencing the highest rates of Zika transmission. But Democrats complained that Republicans locked them out of drafting the $1.1 billion funding plan, which would have made $750 million in budget cuts elsewhere. The Republican plan, rushed through the House last week, would have taken money from battling the Ebola virus as well as from funds set aside for implementing the Obamacare health insurance program in U.S. territories. The Senate last month agreed to a bipartisan bill allocating the same amount - $1.1 billion - to fight Zika, but without cutting any other programs. Democrats were especially angry that the Republican proposal that failed on Tuesday would not allow funding to go to private entities such as the womens healthcare provider Planned Parenthood, although the Zika virus can be sexually transmitted. I dont know what universe (McConnell) is living in. What does he think, were all stupid, the American people are dumb? Theyre not. They understand whats going here, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid declared after the vote. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, had vowed to veto the plan, which falls short of his $1.9 billion request, if it ever arrived on his desk. Republicans charged that the Democrats were blocking the measure mainly because it included no funding for Planned Parenthood, a non-profit group that Democrats and Republicans have been skirmishing over for years. It provides health exams, screening and contraception services to women. Republicans have previously sought to cut off all federal funding to the group, which also provides abortions. Planned Parenthood says abortions make up just three percent of its work. Republican Senator John Thune, referring to Planned Parenthood, charged on Monday that Democrats were more interested in pleasing a what he called a special interest group than in acting on Zika. U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. The WHO has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults.

Funding to combat Zika fails to advance in Senate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Funding to battle the Zika virus failed to advance in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, as Democrats blocked a Republican proposal that they said would short-change the challenge posed by the mosquito-borne virus as well as other health priorities. The proposal to provide $1.1 billion in funding, which has already passed the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, got 52 votes, well short of the 60 votes needed in the Senate to clear a procedural hurdle. It was unclear when Congress would revisit the issue.   ",politicsNews,"June 28, 2016 ",1
Republican Ryan wants trade talks with Britain,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, called on Tuesday for Washington, in parallel with its negotiations with Europe, to pursue a separate free trade agreement with Britain, once it has formally separated from the European Union. Ryan, the highest-ranking elected Republican in the United States, echoed a call from many members of his party, who have dismissed President Barack Obamas contention that Britain will be at the back of the queue for trade talks. Obama issued that warning in April when he intervened to try to persuade Britons to vote to remain in the June 23 referendum on staying or leaving the EU.   Free trade agreements require the approval of both houses of the U.S. Congress. Ryans Republicans currently control a majority in both the House and Senate.  EU and U.S. negotiations had sought to conclude the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) talks before Obama leaves office in January. Although many of his fellow Democrats oppose trade deals as a potential threat to U.S. jobs, Obama has worked with Republicans to pass trade measures. That is something we should begin discussions with Great Britain to ease concerns so that we do have a smooth trade relationship with Great Britain because they are our indispensable ally, Ryan said on WISN, a radio station in his home state Wisconsin. The remarks were distributed by Ryans office in Washington. Some trade experts have said that a deal on TTIP is unlikely for years now without Britain at the table, which could open an opportunity for a separate deal with Britain.

"For Obama, setbacks from a divided Supreme Court","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court breaks for the summer this week, having dealt high-profile setbacks to President Barack Obama on issues important to his liberal legacy, notably on immigration and climate change. This will be the high courts last full nine-month term of the Democratic presidents administration. Obama leaves office in January 2017. The court was one shy of its full strength nine members much of this term due to the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on Feb. 13. His absence affected the outcome of some major cases. Four cases, including the immigration dispute, ended in 4-4 splits that left lower court rulings in place. There was little Obama could do about it. Even if the Republican-led U.S. Senate had accepted Obamas March 16 nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to succeed Scalia, it was unlikely he would have made it to the bench in time to hear the terms final round of arguments in April. Hoping their candidate wins the presidential election in November, Republicans insist the choice of Scalias successor should fall to the next president. The administration did score some major wins on abortion and  other social issues, but these were when it intervened in cases where it was not directly involved. Obamas biggest loss came last Thursday on his bid to protect up to four million immigrants from deportation. The 4-4 deadlock will keep him from taking major action on immigration reform, a top policy aim, before he leaves office. In a second major blow to Obamas legacy, the court unexpectedly put on hold sweeping federal regulations meant to curb carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, the centerpiece of his administrations climate change strategy.. That decision by a 5-4 vote, days before Scalias death, effectively put off a ruling on the regulation until after a legal challenge is completed - sometime after the next president enters the White House - and prevented the new regulations from being implemented. On healthcare, the administration lost narrowly to Christian groups that sought an exemption to a provision of his signature law known as Obamacare requiring employers to provide health insurance coverage for contraception.  The high court sent that dispute back to lower courts without deciding the main legal issue, throwing out a series of rulings in the governments favor. The administration lost some other big cases in which it was directly involved, including former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnells successful appeal of his corruption convictions. A silver lining for the administration came in cases where it lent its support, as a friend of the court, to advocates for abortion rights and for race-based university admissions to offset years of discrimination. Elizabeth Wydra, president of the liberal leaning Constitutional Accountability Center, said Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, the administrations top Supreme Court lawyer until he stepped down last week, deserved some credit for the ruling on Monday striking down tough abortion restrictions in Texas due to his performance during the oral argument. Last Thursday, the court upheld consideration of race as an acceptable factor in admissions at the University of Texas. Had Scalia lived, the court might have deadlocked 4-4 in that too. One 4-4 decision went the administrations way. The government supported unions that successfully fended off a conservative legal challenge. The divided court left in place a lower court ruling in favor of the unions. With Scalia on the court, the conservative majority would likely have struck down fees that many states force workers to pay unions in lieu of dues to fund collective bargaining and other activities.  A loss for unions would have deprived unions representing teachers, police, transit workers, firefighters and other government employees of millions of dollars annually and diminished their political clout. The administration also scored a significant victory when the court upheld an electricity-markets regulation that encourages big power users like factories to cut consumption at peak times, rejecting a challenge brought by electric utilities.

"Supreme Court firmly backs abortion rights, tosses Texas law","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday struck down a Texas abortion law imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities in the strongest endorsement of abortion rights in America in more than two decades. The 5-3 ruling held that the Republican-backed 2013 Texas law placed an undue burden on women exercising their right under the U.S. Constitution to end a pregnancy, established in the courts landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. The abortion providers who challenged the law said it was medically unnecessary and specifically intended to shut clinics.  Texas officials said it was intended to protect womens health. The ruling means similar laws in other states are probably unconstitutional and could put in jeopardy other types of abortion restrictions enacted in various conservative states. The decision should send a loud signal to politicians that they can no longer hide behind sham rationales to shut down clinics and prevent a woman who has decided to end a pregnancy from getting the care she needs, said Jennifer Dalven, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union. President Barack Obama, whose administration backed the abortion providers in the court challenge, said in a statement he was pleased to see the Supreme Court protect womens rights and health and that restrictions like those in Texas harm womens health and place an unconstitutional obstacle in the path of a womans reproductive freedom. Conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy joined the courts four liberal members in the ruling, with the remaining three conservatives dissenting. The court declared that both key provisions of the law - requiring abortion doctors to have  difficult-to-obtain admitting privileges at a local hospital and requiring clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities - violated a womans right to an abortion. Writing for the court, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said, We conclude that neither of these provisions offers medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes. Each places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a pre-viability abortion, each constitutes an undue burden on abortion access, and each violates the federal Constitution, Breyer added. Deferring to state legislatures over questions of medical uncertainty is also inconsistent with this courts case law, Breyer added. The ruling in the case, Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt, represented the most vigorous affirmation of abortion rights in the United States since a 1992 ruling affirmed a womans right to have the procedure. On a warm sunny summer day, hundreds of people on both sides of the issue converged on the Supreme Court building, with abortion rights advocates dancing and celebrating after the ruling. Were ecstatic. The reality is today women won, abortion rights activist Marcela Howell said. The law was passed by a Republican-led legislature and signed by a Republican governor in 2013. Ten states currently have admitting privileges requirements on the books while six have laws requiring hospital-grade facilities. Lower courts have blocked admitting privileges provisions in five states and halted facilities regulations in two states.  The decision erodes states lawmaking authority to safeguard the health and safety of women and subjects more innocent life to being lost. Texas goal is to protect innocent life, while ensuring the highest health and safety standards for women, Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott said. Since the law was passed, the number of abortion clinics in Texas, the second-most-populous U.S. state with about 27 million people, had dropped from 41 to 19. The Supreme Court has appeals pending in two cases involving admitting privilege laws in Mississippi and Wisconsin on which it could act as soon as Tuesday.  The Texas law required abortion doctors to have admitting privileges, a type of formal affiliation, at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic so they can treat patients needing surgery or other critical care. The law also required clinic buildings to possess costly, hospital-grade facilities. These regulations covered numerous building features such as corridor width, the swinging motion of doors, floor tiles, parking spaces, elevator size, ventilation, electrical wiring, plumbing, floor tiling and even the angle that water flows from drinking fountains. Americans remain closely divided over whether abortion should be legal. In a Reuters/Ipsos online poll involving 6,769 U.S. adults conducted from June 3 to June 22, 47 percent of respondents said abortion generally should be legal and 42 percent said it generally should be illegal. Views on abortion in the United States have changed very little over the decades, according to historical polling data. The last time the justices decided a major abortion case was nine years ago when they ruled 5-4 to uphold a federal law banning a late-term abortion procedure. Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and CEO of Whole Womans Health, which led the challenge to the Texas law, said, Every day Whole Womans Health treats our patients with compassion, respect and dignity - and today the Supreme Court did the same. Were thrilled that today justice was served and our clinics stay open. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Twitter called the ruling a victory for women in Texas and across America. This fight isnt over: The next president has to protect womens health. Women wont be punished for exercising their basic rights, she said, a dig at presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who once suggested women who get illegal abortions should face some sort of punishment. The presidential election is Nov. 8. Some U.S. states have pursued a variety of restrictions on abortion, including banning certain types of procedures, prohibiting it after a certain number of weeks of gestation, requiring parental permission for girls until a certain age, imposing waiting periods or mandatory counseling, and others. Its exceedingly unfortunate that the court has taken the ability to protect womens health out of the hands of Texas citizens and their duly-elected representatives, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in a statement. Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito dissented. The normally nine-justice court was one member short after the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who consistently opposed abortion in past rulings.

Abortion providers aim to reopen some closed Texas clinics,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Abortion providers in Texas reacted with surprise and elation on Monday to the U.S. Supreme Courts decision to throw out the states restrictive abortion law and said they aimed to reopen some clinics shut down since the measure was passed in 2013. Since the law was passed by a Republican-led legislature and signed by a Republican governor, the number of abortion clinics in Texas, the second-most-populous U.S. state with about 27 million people, has fallen from 41 to 19. I am honestly surprised by the Supreme Court decision, Rachel Bergstrom-Carlson,health center manager at Planned Parenthood of Austin, said at the clinic that performs about 250 abortions per month in the Texas state capital. But Bergstrom-Carlson said she does not think the ruling all of the sudden creates open access to abortion for Texas women or that it means other legislation intended to restrict womens access to safe and legal abortions will be scrapped. Abortion providers said the law imposed medically unnecessary regulations that were intended to shut clinics. Texas state officials said the law was aimed at protecting womens health. Dr. Bhavik Kumar, who performs abortions at Whole Womans Health clinics in Texas, said abortion providers will seek to reopen some of the shuttered clinics but do not expect to be able to return to the number in operation prior to the law. Negotiating new leases and hiring staff will mean a slow return to operations for those that do re-open, Kumar said. The Supreme Court ruled that both key provisions of the law - requiring abortion doctors to have difficult-to-obtain admitting privileges at a local hospital and requiring clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities - violated a womans right to an abortion established in a 1973 landmark ruling. I am beyond elated, Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and CEO of Whole Womans Health, which operates four abortion clinics in Texas and spearheaded the challenge to the law. After years of fighting heartless, anti-abortion Texas politicians who would seemingly stop at nothing to push abortion out of reach, I want everyone to understand: you dont mess with Texas, you dont mess with Whole Womans Health, she added. If the Supreme Court had left the law in place, only eight clinics would have remained open, including the Planned Parenthood facility in Austin, a U.S. lower court judge said. The states Republican leaders, including the governor and attorney general, criticized the ruling that they said would endanger public health. Now abortion clinics are free to ignore these basic safety standards and continue practicing under substandard conditions, Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said.By its ruling, the court held that the ability of abortion clinics to remain open  even under substandard conditions  outweighs the states ability to put womens health and safety first. The legislature meets again next year, and top lawmakers indicated they may look at new abortion restrictions. The admitting privileges provision, requiring doctors who perform abortions to have formal affiliation with a hospital within 30 miles (48 kms) of their clinic, had gone into effect. The facilities standards had been put on hold by courts. ",politicsNews,"June 27, 2016 ",1
Court decision shifts abortion battle to state bans,"(Reuters) - The battle over abortion was expected to shift to measures focusing on the fetus in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Courts decision striking down a Texas law enacted in the name of maternal health. The 5-3 ruling held that Texas clinic regulations put an undue burden on women seeking abortion, a right established in the courts landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. The ruling could affect similar laws in more than a dozen states and stands as the biggest affirmation of abortion rights in more than two decades.  Opponents said they would regroup, turning their attention to defending and expanding laws that ban abortion after 20 weeks gestation or sooner. But this path could be difficult as well. The Supreme Court has not taken up any outright ban on abortion tied to fetal gestation in decades and has repeatedly rejected pleas by states to endorse such laws. We believe that, even before today, these laws were very likely to be struck down because they are unconstitutional bans on abortion, said Emily J. Martin, general counsel for the National Womens Law Center. Todays decision only strengthens that conclusion. Abortion opponents acknowledged the defeat but vowed to press on. The pro-life movement takes two steps forward and, occasionally, a step backward, said Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee. More than a dozen states now have provisions banning abortions after 20 weeks, and, and we are going to be pushing that, Tobias said. Nebraska enacted the first 20-week ban in 2010. Since then, similar laws have been adopted in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research organization that supports abortion rights. Mississippis law bans abortion after just 18 weeks. Abortion opponents said they also planned to step up efforts encouraging states to limit second term abortions through bans on the use of dilation and extraction method. Nine of 10 abortions in the United States are performed in the first trimester. But the dilation and extraction method is the most common procedure used for second trimester abortions. Kansas and Oklahoma adopted bans on the procedure last year, but those laws have been blocked by courts. West Virginia, Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana passed laws this year; none has yet to draw challenge. The Supreme Court has turned away state efforts to revive bans struck down by lower courts. Earlier this year, it rejected Arkansas bid to revive a ban on abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.  The Supreme Court turned away North Dakotas effort to revive a law that banned most abortions once a fetal heartbeat could be detected, as early as six weeks after conception. And, in 2014, it declined to hear Arizonas appeal of a lower-court ruling invalidating a ban on the procedure at 20 weeks. Before Monday, the last time the court had taken up an abortion rights case was in the 2007 dispute over a federal ban on a procedure critics call partial birth abortion. The procedure, known medically as intact dilation and extraction, involves a physician removing most of the fetus intact rather than dismembering it. By a 5-4 vote, the court upheld the procedure. Writing the majority opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy referred to moral issues and Congresss findings that the procedure would not be necessary for the health of the mother. In Mondays case, Kennedy joined the majority decision that the Texas law lacks the medical benefits to justify the burden it places on womens access to abortion. ",politicsNews,"June 28, 2016 ",1
Jack Lew urges Senate to act on Puerto Rico debt,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Monday called on the Senate to take immediate action this week to address Puerto Ricos $70 billion debt crisis before the critical July 1 deadline for the island territorys next debt payments. The Senate should take up the matter immediately, Lew said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Delay will only jeopardize the ability of Congress to conclude its work before July 1, a critical deadline Puerto Ricos leadership has publicly highlighted for months. If no action is taken, the crisis there will only ratchet higher, he said in the letter. Puerto Rico faces a deadline on Friday to pay off $2 billion of its debts. Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said later in a floor speech that the vote would take place on Wednesday. I really do think that we can go ahead and support the bill, he said.  A senior Republican aide could not confirm that a vote would take place on Wednesday.    The financially ailing island is staring down $70 billion worth of debt that it says it cannot repay in full, adding to its 45 percent poverty rate and rising emigration to the U.S. mainland that is also cutting into its economic growth. The Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives already passed legislation to address Puerto Ricos debt before leaving Washington for the July 4 holiday break. The Senate is expected to recess at the end of this week. The House bill, a rare piece of bipartisan legislation,  would establish a federal oversight board to negotiate various debt restructurings while seeking to institute balanced budgets on the island, a U.S. territory with 3.5 million residents. Lew called on senators to also pass the House measure - the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act, or PROMESA - this week to get it to President Barack Obama to sign into law before Fridays payment deadline. The Senate, also controlled by Republicans, is expected to debate the measure this week, but Democrats have said they want changes - a move that could complicate its passage. A vote is expected this week. ",politicsNews,"June 27, 2016 ",1
Senate set to begin debate on Puerto Rico debt relief bill,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - After months of waiting for the U.S. Congress to act as Puerto Ricos economic crisis progressively worsened, the Caribbean island is on the verge of securing a relief plan from Washington aimed at helping it address a hobbling $70 billion debt. The Senate is set to launch a debate on Wednesday for legislation establishing a federal oversight board that would be in charge of restructuring the U.S. territorys debt where one out of every three dollars it earns in revenue is used to pay creditors, according to the U.S. Treasury. Were not going to let Puerto Rico go off the cliff here. Its too important, said Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. The measure is identical to the plan passed by the House of Representatives earlier this month, as Congress tries to send it to President Barack Obama to sign into law by July 1. That is when Puerto Rico faces a potential default on a chunk of its debt if it cannot make a $1.9 billion payment.  As early as Wednesday, the Senate could cast a procedural vote on the bill that, if successful, would clear the measure for passage this week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also took steps to limit amendments that can be offered to the bill. Some Democrats have complained about the makeup and operation of the oversight board that would be appointed by Washington as well as provisions demanded by House Republicans that potentially could lower minimum wages for some younger workers. Something needs to be done. We would really love some amendments on key issues like the composition of the board, the procedures for taking Puerto Rico into the bankruptcy court, and then especially, the labor provisions on overtime and minimum wage, Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia told reporters. But any amendments would delay Congress work on the bill and make it impossible to get to Obama before July 1, as the House of Representatives would have to sign off and it is in recess until July 5, after the Independence Day holiday weekend. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew reiterated his call for the Senate to pass the bill on Monday, saying if nothing is done by the Friday deadline, the debt crisis will only ratchet higher. Puerto Rico is reeling from a 45 percent poverty rate, a steady flow of outward migration to the U.S. mainland that further shrinks its tax base and the shuttering of essential services. If Congress does not pass the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act, or PROMESA, before July 1, the island could default on all or part of the debt payment, including General Obligation bonds that are senior to all credits. The Senate should take up the matter immediately, Lew said in a letter to McConnell. Delay will only jeopardize the ability of Congress to conclude its work before July 1, a critical deadline Puerto Ricos leadership has publicly highlighted for months. While Puerto Ricans want some sort of relief from the debt their government is saddled with, many of the 3.5 million residents, who are U.S. citizens, nonetheless worry that the proposed seven-member oversight board will trample on San Juans self-governing rights. The bill is not perfect. I do not like the board. I do not like that it doesnt add a mechanism to make our economy grow, but what is the alternative right now? That is why I call on the Senate to vote for this bill, Puerto Rican Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said during a panel discussion last week in Washington. Without PROMESA, an existing trickle of lawsuits could turn into a flood. In April when there was little sign of congressional action, Puerto Ricos legislature passed a local debt moratorium law giving Garcia Padilla the authority to withhold debt payments. Investors on June 21 filed a lawsuit in U.S. federal court calling the Puerto Rico Emergency Moratorium and Rehabilitation Act illegal. We are at the mercy of the judge, Garcia Padilla said during the panel discussion. PROMESA, if signed into law, puts an immediate stay, or hold, on any future lawsuits and is retroactive to December 2015. The stay remains in effect until the debt has been restructured to a sustainable level with the goal being an orderly restructuring an sustainable amount of debt. ",politicsNews,"June 27, 2016 ",1
"U.S. senator, opposing FBI email data grabs, places hold on spy bill","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democratic senator on Monday prevented legislation from being quickly considered that would expand the FBIs power to use secretive surveillance orders to obtain some Internet records, arguing it would lead to a dramatic erosion of U.S. privacy rights.   Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon placed a hold on the annual Intelligence Authorization Act, which grants congressional approval for clandestine operations carried out by the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies. A provision of the authorization bill would allow the Federal Bureau of Investigation to use national security letters, which do not require a warrant, to compel companies such as Alphabet Incs Google and Facebook to hand over certain Internet records. These would include email metadata, some browsing history and social media log-in information. Such an expansion would allow the FBI to retrieve sensitive data of U.S. citizens without court approval, Wyden said.  Convenience alone does not justify such a dramatic erosion of Americans constitutional rights, he said on the Senate floor. National security letters are the latest flashpoint in a years-long debate pitting U.S. surveillance operations against digital privacy interests. Wydens objection blocks the Senate from rapidly advancing the bill and now forces Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell to go through normal order to hold a roll call vote, a process that can take days. Currently, national security letters, or NSLs, can only compel sharing of phone billing records, according to a 2008 legal memo written by the U.S. Justice Department. Still, the FBI has used the letters since then to request Internet records during national security investigations. Senate Republicans have attempted to advance the NSL expansion, which FBI Director James Comey has called his top legislative priority, several times in recent months. Last week the Senate came two votes short of advancing separate legislation that would have expanded national security letters. [uL1N19E0ZY] Though some Republicans invoked the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando earlier this month to promote that measure, Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said last week it was one hundred percent correct that it would not have prevented the massacre. Wyden also said he opposed another provision of the authorization bill that would limit the jurisdiction of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, a government advisory committee that reviews the legality and effectiveness U.S. surveillance programs.

Only one-in-four Canadians support NAFTA ahead of 'Three Amigos' meet,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Only one-in-four Canadians say the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is good for their country, and more than one-third want it renegotiated, according to polling results released ahead of aNorth American leaders Summit onWednesday. The survey from the Angus Reid Institute on Monday come as protectionist sentiment swells in the United States, where voters at both ends of the political spectrum question the economic benefits of NAFTA. The U.S. Congress is hesitating to ratify a new 12-nation trade pact,the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), whichalsoincludes Canada and Mexico. Trade has long been a focus at the so-calledThree Amigos summits between NAFTA members,Canada, the United States and Mexico,held this year in Ottawa. The matter has alsobecome a lightning rod issue in the election campaign to replaceU.S. President Barack Obama, who wants Congress to ratify TPP before he leaves office on Jan. 20. Republican Donald Trump, his partys presumptive nominee for 2016, has attacked the TPP and describesNAFTAas a disaster that needs to be renegotiated or shelved.Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has also said she opposes the TPP. Angus Reid Institutes poll showed also one-quarter of Canadians feel NAFTA hurts the country, while half were either unsure or feel the deal has had no impact either way.  The institutes executive director, Shachi Kurl, said the survey contrasts with past polls on other trade deals, in which Canadians were more likely to support than oppose them.  Is this simply a gap in policy makers adequately convincing Canadians that this has been a good deal? she said. Is NAFTA an exception in that Canadians see the specific trade deal as a bad deal? These are questions that we have to think on. Kurl added the poll raises the question of whether Canadians are concerned about the effects of NAFTA in itself or whether their opinion is part of the global grumpy view on trade, citing U.S. anti-free-trade sentiments.

"Adios, Three Amigos: Obama heads to last summit with Canada, Mexico","WASHINGTON/OTTAWA (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will meet with the leaders of Canada and Mexico on Wednesday for his final Three Amigos summit, a meeting that may signal how keen the North American partners are to tout trade at a time of rising protectionist sentiment. The Ottawa summit comes on the heels of Britain voting to leave the European Union after more than 40 years. It also falls ahead of a U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8 where presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has made stagnant wages and U.S. manufacturing job losses focal points of his insurgent campaign. The so-called Brexit vote is bound to be an important theme for Obamas meetings with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Canadas Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Canada had negotiated a trade deal with the EU that is slated to take effect next year. The Brexit may delay its ratification and hurt Canadas commodity-driven economy. The referendum results are also seen as a setback to talks on a U.S.-EU trade deal. Mexico, which already has a trade deal with the EU, has prepared a draft proposal for a pact with the United Kingdom. At the summit, leaders will also look at how best to foster trade with each other, said Mexicos Finance Minister Luis Videgaray. One of the important issues, without doubt, is how to give a fresh impulse and greater value to North American integration, Videgaray said. All three are part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation trade deal that Obama had cast as an update of the North American Free Trade Agreement. He wants to finalize the TPP as part of his economic legacy in Asia. The TPP has become a target of both the left and the right in the U.S. election, and Congress has so far been unenthusiastic about ratifying the deal. The United States is the top export market for both Canada and Mexico. In 2015, U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico totaled $663 billion and $584 billion, respectively. But in Canada, only one in four people say the 22-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is good for the country, a poll released on Monday showed. The long-running Canada-U.S. battle over softwood lumber seems more likely than not to resume as early as October. Given all the controversy over trade, the leaders may decide to try to focus their summit talking points on other topics. I expect them to try and stay away from it, said Carlo Dade, director of the Canada West Foundations Center for Trade and Investment Policy. Ahead of the summit, the White House revealed that the leaders would commit to a new regional goal of 50 percent of power coming from clean energy by 2025, up from about 37 percent in 2015. The three countries also plan to unveil a plan to fight heroin production. At a joint press conference, the leaders are likely to field questions about the upcoming U.S. election and its implications for both Canada and Mexico. It will also be Obamas first chance on an international stage to promote his recent endorsement of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state. In March, Pena Nieto roundly condemned Trump, who has promised to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs, and has complained about what he calls unfair trade. Mexico also named a new ambassador to aggressively promote its contributions to the U.S. economy. On Canada, Trump has so far been mostly silent.  That doesnt mean Canadians dont feel the sting of his protectionist ideas, said Chris Sands, director of the Center for Canadian Studies at Johns Hopkins Universitys School of Advanced International Studies. Trudeau is likely to tread carefully so as to not endanger relations with a potential president. Its unlikely there will be any formal discussion of Trump, who of course is the elephant in the room. In some ways, its better if there isnt, said one official involved in the summit. The message the leaders will be sending is eloquent enough - the three nations are closely integrated and cooperate well and thats how the relationship should work, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. On trade, Pena Nieto and Trudeau are also cognizant that talk is cheap on the campaign trail. I have to tell my Canadian friends this often - it doesnt mean it will be the agenda once you get to the White House, said David Wilkins, the U.S. ambassador to Canada from 2005-09 during the George W. Bush administration. Obama provides a good case in point.  In his 2008 presidential campaign, he demonized NAFTA, but once in office, he began working on the TPP, a deal he has said would fix his concerns about NAFTA. Theres very much a Keep calm and carry on approach and were going to ignore some of the domestic politicking and see what happens when it happens, said a Canadian source familiar with the summit talks.

"In campaign trail debut with Clinton, Warren says Trump driven by greed","CINCINNATI (Reuters) - Liberal Elizabeth Warren attacked Republican Donald Trump on Monday during her first campaign appearance with U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, calling him an insecure money grubber who is driven by greed and hate.  Warren, a leader of the Democratic Partys progressive wing and a potential vice presidential pick, said Clinton had spent her career fighting for liberal values while Trump, a wealthy real estate developer, was focused on boosting his bottom line. The U.S. senator from Massachusetts appeared with Clinton before a raucous, enthusiastic crowd in Cincinnati, Ohio, targeting a battleground state in a potential preview of a Clinton-Warren campaign team. She repeatedly accused Trump of looking out for himself instead of for average Americans. When Donald Trump says hell make America great, he means make it even greater for rich guys just like Donald Trump, Warren said, standing shoulder to shoulder with a cheering Clinton. Clinton has struggled to win over some liberal backers of rival Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist U.S. senator from Vermont, since beating him for the Democratic nomination this month. She hopes the support of Warren can help her in that effort as she campaigns against Trump for the Nov. 8 election. Warren, who has vigorously attacked Trump in recent weeks, called him a small, insecure money grubber who fights for no one but himself and warned: He will crush you into the dirt to get whatever he wants. Thats who he is. The capacity crowd repeatedly roared its approval, and a line of supporters who could not get inside stretched out the door and down the street. At one point, Warren stopped her speech to turn and applaud Clinton, a former secretary of state. She knows what it takes to beat a thin-skinned bully who is driven by greed and hate, said Warren, known for calling for reining in Wall Street and eradicating income inequality. WARREN A SELLOUT - TRUMP In a statement, Trump called Warren a sellout for backing Clinton, who has taken donations from Wall Street interests and once backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Asian trade deal. Clinton has since reversed her trade stance. In an interview with NBC News, Trump called Warren a fraud and a racist, accusing her of making up claims about her Native American heritage to advance her career. He again called Warren Pocahontas, the name of a 17th-century Native American figure, to draw attention to a controversy first raised during Warrens 2012 Senate race in Massachusetts. She is one of the least productive senators in the United States Senate, Trump told NBC. We call her Pocahontas for a reason. Two other potential Clinton vice presidential picks - U.S. senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Sherrod Brown of Ohio - rejected Trumps assertion and defended Warrens record. Thats what he does, he attacks people. He acts like hes attacking their character - hes attacking his own character when he does that, Brown told Reuters. You cant believe anything Donald Trump says. Period, Kaine told Reuters. Taking the microphone in Ohio, Clinton said she liked Warrens aggressive approach to her Republican rival, who has sprayed rivals and critics with insults throughout his campaign. I just love how she gets under Donald Trumps skin, Clinton said. Clintons decision to campaign with Warren for the first time in Cincinnati, a city on Ohios southwestern border with Kentucky and Indiana, underscored the swing states vital role in the November showdown with Trump. Ohio has backed every successful presidential nominee since 1964 and no Republican has won the White House without carrying the state.     Warrens calls to rein in corporate excess could resonate with two groups Clinton must court in the election - Sanders supporters and those anxious about the economy who are drawn to Trumps promise to toss out international trade deals. Ohios manufacturing base has taken a hit in recent economic slowdowns, and Trump has identified it as a state where his anti-free trade rhetoric could resonate with alienated blue-collar voters. Since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee, Clinton has repeatedly tried to portray businessman Trump as fundamentally unfit for the presidency. Clinton said Warrens long history of fighting for progressive economic values made her a perfect messenger for that critique. ",politicsNews,"June 27, 2016 ",1
"Advocates hail U.S. court abortion decision, predict national impact","NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Abortion rights advocates on Monday cheered a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that struck down restrictions to abortion access in Texas, calling it a major victory for women and predicting similar laws are now endangered nationwide. The high court ruled 5-3 that a Texas law imposing strict regulations on abortion doctors and facilities put an undue burden on women exercising their right to abortion, which has been legal in the United States since 1973. Laws such as the Texas regulations are seen by critics as a backdoor way of restricting abortion access. Hardest hit are rural, poor women for whom distance and cost put abortions out of reach, they say. The Texas law required abortion doctors to have admitting privileges, a formal affiliation that can be hard to obtain, at a hospital within 30 miles (50 km), and required clinics to have costly, hospital-grade facilities such as specified corridor width, floor tiles, parking spaces and elevator size. With todays Supreme Court ruling, I let out a big exhale, said Tracy Droz Tragos, director of Abortion: Stories Women Tell, to be released in August by HBO Documentary Films. At least for a moment, I am optimistic about the future of women in America. Women have had their constitutional rights vindicated, said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights which represented the Texas clinics, in a statement. The Supreme Court sent a loud and clear message that politicians cannot use deceptive means to shut down abortion clinics, she said. Texas claimed its law protected womens health, but critics said the regulations were medically unnecessary and intended to shut down clinics. Writing the Supreme Court decision, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote: We conclude that neither of these provisions offers medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes. Each places a substantial obstacle in the path of women, he wrote. Decrying the decision, anti-abortion groups such as the Susan B. Anthony List said Texas women will be unprotected from dangerous and unsanitary conditions. The abortion industry cannot be trusted to regulate itself and they know it, said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the List, which supports anti-abortion political candidates. Making a similar argument, Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, in a statement said abortion providers prey on the vulnerabilities of women who are in desperate situations, placing their bottom line over the health and safety of the patients. And the U.S. Supreme Court, in efforts to put the so-called right to abortion above everything else, just let them get away with it, she said. Since the restrictive law was passed in 2013, the number of abortion clinics in Texas, a state of 27 million people, dropped to 19 from 41. Today is a great day for women, said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, in a statement. The Supreme Court has powerfully reaffirmed a womans constitutional right to make her own decisions about her health, family, and future, no matter her zip code, she said. Similar laws are likely to be struck down, experts said, in states with restrictions such as requiring women to make repeated visits or requiring ultrasounds for women seeking abortions and that the images be shown to them. Weve known for a long time that the purpose of these laws is to prevent women from having abortions, said reproductive rights attorney Kathryn Kolbert, who argued a major abortion case before the high court in 1992. It may not be the death blow, but it certainly makes it more difficult to put forward these types of laws with a straight face, she said. Documentary filmmaker Dawn Porter, who made a film about abortion providers in Texas and elsewhere in Trapped that was released this year, said she was elated. If theres any silver lining in Texas making such an egregiously unconstitutional law, its that I think people have woken up and people are thinking you cant taking any rights for granted, she said. You cannot sleep on your rights. ",politicsNews,"June 27, 2016 ",1
Factbox: Major U.S. Supreme Court abortion rights cases,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Courts key rulings on abortion, dating to the landmark 1973 decision that legalized the procedure nationwide, have long provoked social, religious and political tensions. As the court majority became more conservative over the decades, it set standards that enhance states ability to regulate abortion. Yet even in the most recent rulings, extending to 2007, there have never been five votes on the nine-member court to reverse the fundamental right to abortion. Here is a look at the courts major abortion rulings. Roe v. Wade, 1973, 7-2 vote The court rules that a womans constitutional right to privacy protects her decision to end a pregnancy, and only a compelling state interest can justify regulating abortion. The decision institutes a three-part legal test, connected to a nine-month pregnancy and a fetus viability, that gives states more latitude for regulation with each trimester. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 1992, 5-4 vote The court affirms the right to abortion. Rather than the trimester framework, the test is whether a government regulation imposes an undue burden on a woman seeking an abortion by creating a substantial obstacle to the procedure before the fetus develops to the point at which it becomes viable. Stenberg v. Carhart, 2000, 5-4 vote The court decides that a Nebraska ban on a late-term procedure critics call partial birth abortion violates a womans right to abortion. The procedure, known medically as intact dilation and extraction, involves a physician removing most of the fetus intact rather than dismembering it. The justices fault the Nebraska ban, similar to laws in a majority of the states at the time, for its ambiguity about precisely what type of medical procedure is prohibited and for lacking an exception for the health of the mother. Gonzales v. Carhart, 2007, 5-4 vote The court decides that a federal Partial Birth Abortion Act, involving the same type of procedure as in the Nebraska dispute and without an exception for the womans health, is constitutional. The majority distinguishes the ruling from the 2000 case by noting that Congress developed findings that the procedure would never be necessary for the health of the mother. Another factor in the reversed course was that in 2000, Justice Sandra Day OConnor had voted to strike down the partial-birth ban. She was succeeded by Samuel Alito in 2006, and in 2007 he cast the fifth vote in favor of the ban. Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt, 2016, 5-3 vote The court strikes down a Texas abortion law imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities, finding that the 2013 statute put an undue burden on women exercising their right under the U.S. Constitution to end a pregnancy. The court declares that both provisions of the law - requiring physicians who perform abortions to have difficult-to-obtain admitting privileges at a local hospital and requiring clinics to install costly hospital-grade facilities - violate abortion rights. The ruling marked the firmest endorsement of U.S. abortion rights since the 1992 Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey ruling. ",politicsNews,"June 26, 2016 ",1
Timeline: Milestones in legal fight over Texas abortion law,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday handed a victory to abortion rights advocates, striking down a Texas law imposing strict regulations on abortion doctors and facilities. Following is a timeline of that challenge. July 2013 - The Republican-led Texas legislature passes and Republican Governor Rick Perry signs the law known as H.B. 2, putting new requirements on abortion providers. State officials say the law is intended to ensure the health and safety of women. September 2013  Before the law is enforced, Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers challenge the measure. They assert that certain provisions, including one related to doctors admitting privileges - a type of formal affiliation - at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of an abortion clinic, are aimed at decreasing the abortion availability in the state. October 2013  A U.S. district judge sides largely with the challengers, blocking the admitting privileges provision. March 2014 - The New Orleans-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, a regional federal appeals court covering Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, reverses the lower court and permits much of the law to take effect.  April 2014 - Whole Womans Health and other abortion providers bring a new complaint against Texas, citing the effect of the laws implementation and the number of clinics that have closed. The challengers focus on the admitting-privileges requirement and regulations governing clinic facility standards. August 2014  A U.S. district court judge declares the admitting privileges and clinic requirements an unconstitutional burden on womens access to abortion. October 2014 - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit intervenes to allow implementation of both new regulations, but the U.S. Supreme Court blocks part of the order so that the mandate that clinics meet hospital-grade standards does not go into effect. June 2015 - After considering the full merits of the challenge, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit reverses the district judges decision, finding the judge should have deferred to the legislatures stated health and safety goals. The appeals court also says most of the lawsuit should have been barred because the legal issues it raises already were addressed in the case filed by Planned Parenthood. June 2015 - The U.S. Supreme Court by a 5-4 vote puts a temporary hold on the 5th Circuits ruling while the justices consider whether to hear the challengers appeal. That action blocks the provision regarding hospital-grade standards from taking effect. September 2015 - The abortion providers challenging the Texas restrictions ask the U.S. Supreme Court to hear their appeal of the 5th Circuits ruling. November 2015 - The U.S. Supreme Court agrees to hear the challenge by abortion providers to the Texas restrictions. February 2016 - Conservative U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a supporter of abortion restrictions, dies at age 79, leaving the court shorthanded and evenly divided with four liberals and four conservatives. March 2016 - The U.S. Supreme Court hears 85 minutes of oral arguments in the case, known as Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt. The courts four liberal justices indicate they believe the law intrudes on a womans constitutional right to abortion. The four conservative justices express doubts about claims by abortion providers that the law forced numerous clinics to shut down. June 2016 - The U.S. Supreme Court strikes down the Texas law, finding that it places an undue burden on women exercising their right under the U.S. Constitution to end a pregnancy.

Clinton campaign hits Trump for seeing Brexit as boon to his business,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clintons presidential campaign accused Donald Trump on Sunday of caring more about how Britains historic vote to leave the European Union would benefit his financial bottom line than how it would impact the U.S. economy. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook acknowledged parallels between the populist anger and anti-establishment fervor that fueled the Brexit vote and Trumps rise to the nomination, but said the Republican candidates reaction showed he was not fit to occupy the White House. Hillary Clinton looks at this through the lens of how its going to affect middle-class families, Donald Trump through the lens of how it will help his bottom line, Mook said on Fox News Sunday.  Without mentioning Trump by name, Clinton also warned that bombastic comments in turbulent times can actually cause more turbulence in a speech to a conference of city mayors in Indianapolis on Sunday afternoon. Her campaign released a national television advertisement earlier in the day, which featured the wealthy real estate developers comments on Friday that the fall of the British currency after the Brexit vote could mean more business for his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, where he was speaking.  Every president is tested by world events, but Donald Trump thinks about how his golf resort can profit from them, said the  30-second video. Besides his currency comments, Trump had praised the Brexit result as an example of people taking their country back. He responded to the advertisement on Sunday by saying Clinton, whose staff had said she supported the United Kingdom remaining in the union, had poor judgment. Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgment call on BREXIT with big dollar ads, ran a message on his Twitter account. Disgraceful! Paul Manafort, campaign manager for Trump, rejected what he called a phony charge by Clinton and said Trump was more in sync with the global economic frustration exemplified by the Brexit vote. In contrast, the Clinton ad showed her campaigns tone deafness by focusing on things the American people did not care about, he said in an NBC interview. In her speech on Sunday, Clinton said the United States and the United Kingdom were different economically, politically, demographically, but still drew some parallels between the mood of American and British voters. Just as we have seen, there are many frustrated people in Britain, we know there are frustrated people here at home, too, she said. I have seen it, Ive heard it, I know it. Global stock markets nosedived on Friday and economic experts warned of a potential global recession after the shocking British vote to pull out of the European Union. Markets prepared for the possibility of more pain on Monday. Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the Brexit vote highlighted global anxieties about economic stagnation and immigration. The genius of whats happened with the candidacy of Donald Trump is hes given voice to that, just as was given in the UK, Corker, who has been mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick for Trump, said on CNNs State of the Union program. He said he thought Trumps appearance at his golf course in Scotland after the Brexit vote was one of his best events and  his comments about the British currency and what it would mean for his businesses were just an anecdotal statement about its effects. He was giving an example, which is obvious, that when the currency fluctuates, as it does, more Americans are going to be able to travel to the UK more cheaply, he said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said the Brexit vote showed people were tired of being dictated to by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, and said there were parallels in the United States. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who built his White House campaign against Clinton around populist proposals to eradicate income inequality, remove big money from politics and rein in Wall Street, said the Brexit vote encapsulated many of those concerns. What ordinary people are saying is hey, give us an economy that works for all of us, not just the people on top, Sanders said on CNN. ",politicsNews,"June 26, 2016 ",1
Trump plays down post-Brexit market turmoil on Aberdeen visit,"ABERDEEN, Scotland (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump played down market turmoil in the wake of Britains decision to leave the European Union on a visit to his Trump International golf course in Aberdeen on Saturday. Wearing an open-necked shirt, a suit and a white baseball cap with his slogan Make America great again, Trump was asked if he was worried about the volatility in financial markets following Britains vote to leave the EU on Thursday.  Theres always turmoil no matter where you go, no matter what you do, he said. Global stock markets lost about $2 trillion in value on Friday after the vote, while sterling fell to a 31-year low. Trump, whose mother was Scottish, was greeted by around a dozen protesters at the course waving Mexican flags, rainbow flags for Gay Pride day and signs that read Donald stop the hating and Shame on you for ruining a beautiful landscape. Trump last year proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States as a response to Islamist attacks in Paris and California, causing a furor in Europe. In an article in a Scottish newspaper earlier this year, Trump pointed to his determination to overcome local opposition to his golf course projects as an example of the leadership skills that Americans would get if he were to become president. He also met with News Corporation media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his wife Jerry Hall, giving them a tour of the course in a golf cart. ",politicsNews,"June 25, 2016 ",1
TransCanada formally seeks NAFTA damages in Keystone XL rejection,"TORONTO (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp is formally requesting arbitration over U.S. President Barack Obamas rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline, seeking $15 billion in damages, the company said in legal papers dated Friday.  TransCanada submitted a notice for an arbitration claim in January and had then tried to negotiate with the U.S. government to reach an amicable settlement, the company said in files posted on the pipelines website. Unfortunately, the parties were unable to settle the dispute. TransCanada said it then filed its formal arbitration request under North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) provisions, seeking to recover what it says are costs and damages. The Keystone XL was designed to link existing pipeline networks in Canada and the United States to bring crude from Alberta and North Dakota to refineries in Illinois and, eventually, the Gulf of Mexico coast.      Obama rejected the cross-border crude oil pipeline last November, seven years after it was first proposed, saying it would not make a meaningful long-term contribution to the U.S. economy. TransCanada is suing the United States in federal court in a separate legal action, seeking to reverse the pipelines rejection. NAFTA, whose arbitration provisions allow companies to challenge governments before international panels, has been a target of recent anti-free-trade sentiments in the United States. The heads of NAFTA members, Canada, the United States and Mexico, are expected to meet in Ottawa for a North American leaders Summit on June 29. Canada was supposed to host the meeting early last year but canceled it amid tension between then Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Obama over the Keystone XL pipeline. TransCanada and the U.S. Department of Energy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  ",politicsNews,"June 25, 2016 ",1
Obama tries to limit fallout from British EU exit vote,"PALO ALTO, Calif. (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday tried to limit the fallout from Britains vote to leave the European Union, which threatens to harm the U.S. economic recovery, derail his trade agenda and  distract U.S. allies from global security issues.    Obama, who had argued passionately against Britain leaving the EU in a trip to the country this year, vowed that Washington would still maintain both its special relationship with London and close ties to Brussels.           While the UKs relationship with the EU will change, one thing that will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations. That will endure, he told an event at Stanford University, referring to close ally Britain. The EU will remain one of our indispensable partners, Obama said. He spoke to outgoing British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel after the stunning result of Thursdays referendum, the biggest blow to the European project of greater unity since World War Two. Obama said he was sure Britains exit would be orderly and vowed that the United States and Britain would stay focused on ensuring economic growth and financial stability.  The Brexit result rattled Wall Street and many other financial markets, with global stock markets losing about $2 trillion in value on Friday.     I must say we had looked for a different outcome. We would have preferred a different outcome, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, traveling in Ireland, said on Friday. The historic divorce launched by the Brexit vote could sink hopes of a massive U.S.-EU free trade deal before Obama leaves the White House in January.               Negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP, were already stalled by deeply entrenched differences and growing anti-trade sentiment on both continents.     As well as the global economic consequences, Brexit makes it more difficult for Obama and the United States to corral its Western allies into joint action against challenges such as Islamic State, Russia and the rise of China. Britains exit could present the next U.S. president with a decision on whether to turn to other key European partners like Germany and France, essentially downgrading the United States special bond with Britain, whose foundation was laid in World War Two. Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, called on Washingtons partners in Europe to keep their eye on foreign policy threats. We must maintain our trans-Atlantic consensus on how to deal with a resurgent Russia and the growing threat of ISIS, he said. I urge leaders in London, Brussels and across Europe to not lose sight of these threats and remain coordinated in our response.  The U.S. presidential election candidates are casting an eye across the Atlantic at the unlikely success of Britains Leave campaign, which has similarities with Republican Donald Trumps insurgent bid for the Nov. 8 election. Trumps rise was sustained by a similar brew of anti-establishment and anti-globalization sentiment and concern about immigration that helped the Leave vote.  This is a protest vote against globalization and there is one presidential candidate who won the nomination who has put globalization in his crosshairs - and thats Donald Trump, Republican strategist John Feehery said.                  Biden, in remarks prepared for a speech at Dublin Castle, took a swipe at Trump without mentioning him by name. He warned against politicians and demagogues peddling xenophobia, nationalism, and isolationism.         Brexit supporter Trump called the result a great thing.     People want to take their country back. They want to have independence in a sense. You see it with Europe, all over Europe, Trump, 70, said in Turnberry, Scotland where he reopened a golf course.  Republican Senator Jeff Sessions said Britains electoral shock showed that national leaders will be punished if they do not first ensure they have protected the safety and legitimate interests of their own people. Brexit is a warning for America, said Sessions, a Trump supporter who criticized radical trade policies that erode the power of the people to control their lives.            Obama had warned British voters against Brexit, in an unusually strong intervention into British politics in April. The White House said on Friday that he stands by a comment made then that Britain would move to the back of the queue when it comes to trade deals with the United States if it left the EU.        Obama hopes his former secretary of state Hillary Clinton will win the November election and safeguard his legacy but economic volatility in the United States after Brexit could hurt her chances of beating Trump. In response to Britains decision to leave, Clinton said the United States must first safeguard against any economic fallout at home at this time of uncertainty and underscore its commitment to both Britain and Europe.      The U.S. Federal Reserve sought to calm global financial markets by saying it was ready to provide dollar liquidity following the British vote. U.S. financial regulators said the countrys financial system is functioning in an orderly manner.  The Financial Stability Oversight Council - which includes the heads of the U.S. Treasury, Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Reserve - noted that the U.S. financial system continues to function in an orderly manner, and that the Council will continue to monitor ongoing developments, according to a summary released after a phone call among members. After Brexit, the U.S. central banks ambitions for two rate rises this year now look unlikely. Traders of U.S.-interest rate futures even began to price in a small chance of a Fed rate cut, and now see little chance of any hike until the end of next year. One can forget about rate hikes in the near term, said Thomas Costerg, New York-based economist at Standard Chartered Bank. What Im worried about is that the Brexit vote could be the straw that breaks the back of the U.S. growth picture.  ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 ",1
Clinton regains double-digit lead over Trump: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton regained a double-digit lead over Republican rival Donald Trump this week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday. The June 20-24 poll showed that 46.6 percent of likely American voters supported Clinton while 33.3 percent supported Trump. Another 20.1 percent said they would support neither candidate. Trump had enjoyed a brief boost in support following the June 12 mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, as he doubled down on his pledge to ban Muslims from entering the country, cutting Clintons lead to nine points.  But Trumps rise in popularity appeared to be only temporary, unlike his lasting surge among the Republican field last year after the attacks in Paris and in San Bernardino, California. Clintons 13.3 percentage point lead is about the same as she had before the Orlando attack.  Trumps slip this week came as he struggled to show that he can keep up with a Clinton campaign apparatus that has dwarfed his in size and funding.  Campaign finance disclosures released earlier this week showed Trump started June with a war chest of just $1.3 million, a fraction of Clintons $42 million. Trump sought to ease concerns among his allies by saying that he could tap his unlimited personal wealth if needed, and also by bolstering efforts to raise money through fundraising events and online donations. Meanwhile, Republican leaders including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker continued to express reservations about their new standard bearer, who has angered some in the party with his fiery rhetoric.  Ryan and Walker both said over the past week that they felt Republicans should follow their conscience when deciding to support the partys likely nominee, instead of urging party members to support him. The poll only captured some of the voter reaction to Britains decision in Thursdays referendum to exit the European Union, a move that some pundits say suggests Trumps insurgent candidacy has tapped into a broad and powerful anti-globalization wave sweeping Western countries. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online and included interviews with 1,201 likely voters in all 50 states. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3.3 percentage points.

Brexit crisis tops off rough stretch in Obama's push for legacy,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - The financial and political fallout from Britains vote to leave the European Union has added to a string of setbacks for President Barack Obama as he works to burnish his legacy before his presidency ends in January 2017. The Brexit decision came after a deadlock in the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday effectively ended Obamas push to overhaul immigration rules, and the week after the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. For Obama, the reversals heighten pressure on him and fellow Democrats to work harder for the Nov. 8 elections - particularly for the partys presumptive presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, who represents his best shot at making sure more of his policies are not rolled back. Speaking at two fundraising events in Seattle on Friday night, at the end of an arduous day that saw global markets plunge after the Brexit vote, Obama acknowledged the shifting political winds four months from the vote. If you didnt think the stakes were high before, you should think the stakes are pretty high right now, Obama said at an intimate fundraising dinner at the home of tech executive Steve Singh. Guests, arranged in two long tables, paid $10,000 to $66,800 per couple. Obama has argued technology and globalization can increase opportunities for all, but conceded that recent events show many people are frightened by global competition and feel left behind. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and political novice, has tapped into those concerns about the economy, trade and immigration - fears that also figured into the UK campaign to leave the EU. Unfortunately, when people are anxious and scared, there are going to be politicians out there who try to prey on that frustration to get themselves headlines and to get themselves votes, Obama told about 3,000 people who paid $250 and up to attend a campaign-style event on Friday for Washington States Democratic Governor Jay Inslee. Clinton regained a double-digit lead over Trump this week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday that showed 46.6 percent of likely American voters supported Clinton while 33.3 percent backed Trump. In April, Obama had taken the unusual step of traveling to London to help the Remain camp of the referendum for his friend and ally, Prime Minister David Cameron, who will now leave office before Obama does. The financial uncertainty from Brexit threatens to weigh on the strong U.S. economy and undo some of the recovery seen since Obama took office in early 2009 at the height of the financial crisis. Earlier this week, Obamas plan to remove the specter of deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants was quashed when the Supreme Court deadlocked over lifting a hold on the action. And two weeks ago, the nations worst mass shooting in modern history, at a gay nightclub in Orlando, raised questions about how Obama is dealing with home-grown extremism - and served as a reminder of his failure to convince the U.S. Congress to tighten gun laws. The setbacks show the limits of action that any president can take unilaterally, said Justin Vaughn, a political scientist at Boise State University. I dont think Obamas legacy has taken a hit so much as it came back to earth, Vaughn said. Still, the impression that his administration is unable to control its own political destiny could weigh on how history views Obamas time at the White House, said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political scientist at University of Houston.     Presidents are often judged by what happens in the ninth inning, so President Obamas last few months in office are important to cementing and enhancing his legacy, Rottinghaus said.

"British EU exit a model for Trump's campaign, he says","TURNBERRY, Scotland (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump thrust himself into the heart of Britains vote to leave the European Union on Friday, calling it a great development and drawing parallels to his own insurgent campaign. In Scotland to reopen a golf resort he owns, the wealthy New York businessman wasted no time interpreting the outcome of the Brexit vote as an example of a global uprising against the established order. Its an argument he said fit in with his own campaign to shake up Washington by renegotiating free trade deals and stopping illegal immigration. People want to take their country back. They want to have independence in a sense. You see it with Europe, all over Europe, Trump, 70, the presumptive Republican nominee, told a news conference at the Trump Turnberry golf course.  He said the economic shock from the vote would ebb over time and that more European countries might want to break with the 28-nation European Union. Americans, he said, would have a chance to re-declare their independence and reject todays rule by the global elite when they vote on Nov. 8. So I think youre going to have this happen more and more. I really believe that, and I think that its happening in the United States. Its happening by the fact that Ive done so well in the polls, he said. Trumps rival, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, said in a statement: This time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House to protect Americans pocketbooks and livelihoods, to support our friends and allies, to stand up to our adversaries, and to defend our interests.   It also underscores the need for us to pull together to solve our challenges as a country, not tear each other down, said Clinton, 68, a former U.S. secretary of state, who had openly favored Britains remaining in the EU.     More than half a million Britons signed a petition earlier this year to bar Trump from entering Britain, where he has business interests, in response to his call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. British lawmakers decided against a ban as a violation of free speech. Trump assailed as inappropriate Democratic President Barack Obamas open appeals to Britain not to split off. Shaking off a tradition of not commenting on U.S. politics from foreign soil, Trump said Obama had been embarrassed. Its something he shouldnt have done. Its not his country. Its not his part of the world. He shouldnt have done it. And I actually think that his recommendation perhaps caused it to fail, Trump said. Democrats and Republicans both took stock of a decision that seemed to indicate Trumps campaign had tapped into a global wave that might be hard to contain. Joined by his sons Don Jr. and Eric and daughter Ivanka, who help manage his business affairs, Trump arrived in his signature helicopter near his clubhouse resort, a Scottish flag blowing in the wind. The candidate praised his childrens business acumen, his Scottish-born mother and the golf course itself, dismissing complaints from Republicans that he should have stuck to the campaign trail at home. As it happened, by turning up when he did, Trump drew global televised attention to his views on the Brexit vote within hours of Britons waking up to the surprising result. I said this was going to happen and I think that its a great thing, said Trump, who weeks ago said he would be inclined to leave the EU. Trump had exchanged insults with British Prime Minister David Cameron, who supported staying in the EU and said on Friday after the vote he would resign by October. Cameron had called Trumps anti-immigrant policy ideas divisive and wrong. I think David Cameron is a good man. He was wrong on this.  He didnt get the mood of his country right. He was surprised, Trump said, predicting that Britain and the United States would remain great allies. Wearing a white hat emblazoned with his Make America Great Again campaign slogan, Trump walked up to the news conference with bagpipers heralding his arrival. His visit to Turnberry, to be followed by a stop at his resort in Aberdeen on Saturday, coincided with a vote that exposed deep divisions in Britain and dealt the biggest blow to the European project of greater unity since World War Two. Some Scots who are Turnberry members and who sat in the front row at Trumps news conference muttered no whenever the subject of Scotland leaving the EU came up. Scotland voted by a margin of 62 percent to 38 percent to remain in the EU, a result sharply at odds with Britain as a whole, which voted 52 percent to 48 percent to leave. Trump, who has yet to hold public office and rates unfavorably with 70 percent of Americans in an opinion poll, defeated a crowded field of opponents for the Republican nomination while weathering one controversy after another. The latest was over the firing of his campaign manager this week, a month before the party convention. Trump invested $290 million in renovating the resort and golf course on Scotlands west coast, 85 km (53 miles) southwest of Glasgow. ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 ",1
Sanders will vote for Clinton to stop Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders said on Friday he would vote for Hillary Clinton to stop Republican Donald Trump from winning the White House, a lukewarm show of support that his campaign said was not a formal endorsement. Sanders comments come after weeks of pressure from Democratic Party officials to throw his weight behind Clinton, the presumptive nominee. She locked up the required number of delegates this month with a string of wins in state-by-state primary contests. Clinton, the former U.S. secretary of state, senator, and first lady, needs Sanders supporters to boost her chances against Trump in the Nov. 8 election. Only 40 percent of them say they would vote for her, with the rest undecided or divided between Trump, a third-party candidate and staying home, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.  Asked if he would vote for Clinton in November, Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, told MSNBC television: Yes. The issue right here is Im going to do everything I can to defeat Donald Trump. I think Trump in so many ways would be a disaster for this country if he were elected president. We do not need a president whose cornerstone of his campaign is bigotry, who is insulting Mexicans and Latinos and Muslims and women, who does not believe in the reality of climate change, he continued. A spokeswoman for Sanders said his comments on MSNBC did not amount to an endorsement of Clinton, adding that Senator Sanders is also still an active candidate. Trump has angered minority groups with his hard line on immigration, including calls to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country, deport millions of undocumented immigrants, and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border if he is elected.  A spokeswoman for Trumps campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The wealthy New York businessman has rejected accusations his proposals are bigoted, and has said his policies would help minorities by bolstering the economy and creating jobs. Trump has also called climate change a hoax by the Chinese to hurt business in the United States.       Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, managed to turn his long-shot run into a mass movement with proposals to combat wealth inequality, increase access to healthcare and education, and defend the environment. His challenge to Clinton, one of the best-known figures in U.S. politics, lasted far longer than expected, running for four months and across 50 states and yielding record numbers of small donations to his campaign. Sanders has said he will continue to push for a liberal agenda heading into the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia from July 25-28, when Clintons nomination is expected to become official. He has also made clear he does not want his presence to hurt the partys chances of holding onto the White House.  Three-quarters of likely Democratic voters in the general election say Sanders should have a major role in shaping the partys positions, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted June 17-21. Nearly two-thirds also said that Sanders should endorse Clinton.  ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 ",1
Obama says U.S. special relationship with Britain will endure,"PALO ALTO, Calif. (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Friday that he had spoken with British Prime Minister David Cameron about Britains decision to leave the European Union and that he was confident the United Kingdom was committed to an orderly transition. While the UKs relationship with the EU will change, one thing that will not change is special relationship that exists between our two nations, Obama said in a speech at a global entrepreneurs conference at Stanford University. That will endure. The EU will remain one of our indispensable partners. ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 ",1
"Republican ex-Treasury chief Paulson slams Trump, to vote for Clinton","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Henry Paulson, a Republican who was U.S. Treasury secretary during the 2008 financial meltdown, on Friday called a Donald Trump presidency unthinkable and said he will vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton. Paulson joins a growing list of establishment Republicans who say they will not cast a ballot in the Nov. 8 election for Trump, the partys presumptive nominee and a political neophyte whose populist rhetoric runs counter to many long-held Republican principles. When it comes to the presidency, I will not vote for Donald Trump, Paulson, who was chief executive of Goldman Sachs before becoming Treasury chief under Republican President George W. Bush, wrote in an opinion piece in the Washington Post. Ill be voting for Hillary Clinton, with the hope that she can bring Americans together to do the things necessary to strengthen our economy, our environment and our place in the world, he said. Paulson accused Trump, who has touted his business acumen as a real estate developer during his campaign, of taking imprudent risk and then disavowing his debts when ventures fail. He also took aim at Trumps opposition to trade agreements, which Paulson said have created U.S. jobs and fostered innovation and competitiveness. Simply put, a Trump presidency is unthinkable, Paulson said. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Brent Scowcroft, a national security adviser to two Republican presidents, endorsed Clinton on Wednesday, and Richard Armitage, a deputy secretary of state under George W. Bush, said last week he would support her. Paulson, who helped steer a $700 billion bailout of the financial system through Congress during the financial meltdown, said Trump is a phony who is unfit to be president. I cant help but think what would have happened if a divisive character such as Trump were president during the 2008 financial crisis, at a time when leadership, compromise and careful analysis were critical, he said.

U.S. committed to bringing American hostages home -Obama,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday said the United States remains committed to bringing home Americans held captive overseas and helping their families, a year after the administration promised to overhaul its handling of hostage situations. We will not stop until we can bring our fellow citizens back to their families, Obama said in a statement on the anniversary of the White Houses policy review. Obama specifically named journalist Austin Tice who disappeared in Syria in 2012, Caitlan Coleman held in Afghanistan, and retired FBI agent Robert Levinson, who went missing in Iran more than nine years ago. Earlier this week, the families of four Americans killed by Islamic State urged Obama to do everything possible to bring home Tice, the only U.S. journalist known to be held in war-torn Syria. The parents of the slain hostages criticized Obama for not personally naming Tice in his remarks at this years White House Correspondents Association Dinner when Obama said that he would fight for the release of American hostages held against their will.  They said Tices return would be a test of the of the success of the administrations new policy. The White House undertook a six-month review of its hostage policies after complaints from families that their initiatives to free relatives captured abroad had been discouraged and sometimes blocked by government officials. As part of the overhaul, Obama named James OBrien special presidential envoy for hostage affairs at the State Department to help coordinate the efforts of law enforcement and diplomats. But I know our work will not be done until our fellow Americans who are held against their will, and whose families mark their calendars by the days since theyve held their loved ones, are reunited, Obama said.

"U.S. states, Rockefellers clash with U.S. House panel on Exxon climate probes","HOUSTON (Reuters) - With a number of U.S. states proceeding with investigations of Exxon Mobil Corps (XOM.N) record on climate change, the attorney general of Massachusetts and investment funds of the Rockefeller family on Friday told a Congressional committee it lacked powers to oversee those probes. The pushback is the latest chapter in a high-stakes fight between the worlds largest publicly traded oil company and a coalition of state attorneys general who have said they would go after Exxon to try and force action to tackle climate change.    The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology last week reiterated demands that state attorneys general hand over any records of consultations the prosecutors had with outside environmental groups before their probes were opened. Republicans on the committee have said about 20 state officials overreached when they jointly said in March they would participate in inquiries into whether Exxon executives misled the public by contradicting research from company scientists that spelled out the threats of climate change. State officials have said the committee has no right to get involved. The Committee lacks authority to interfere with an investigation by the Massachusetts Attorney Generals Office into possible violations of Massachusetts law by ExxonMobil, said a letter to the committee from the office of Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey that was seen by Reuters. In another letter to the House panel seen by Reuters, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Rockefeller Family Fund, two investment funds that have been critical of fossil fuels linked to climate change, said the committees request imperiled the funds First Amendment rights and said Congresss investigatory power is not unlimited. Last week, Exxon asked a federal court to throw out a subpoena that would force it to hand over decades of documents on climate change to Healeys office. Both sides in the standoff have sought to use the First Amendment of the Constitution, which guarantees freedom speech and freedom of assembly, among other protections, to press their cases.  The House committee has complained the inquiries risk stifling free speech and scientific inquiry, and that state officials were coordinating with special interest groups. Exxon, which declined to comment on Friday, has repeatedly said that it has acknowledged the reality of climate change for years and communicated this to investors.",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 ",1
New York LGBT bar becomes first U.S. monument to gay rights,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Friday designated the site of a watershed event in the history of U.S. gay rights, the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, as a national monument, the first to honor the contributions of gay Americans. The Stonewall Inn gay bar in Manhattans Greenwich Village was the scene of a police raid that triggered riots and ignited a long struggle to bring lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people into the American mainstream and guarantee their rights. Welcome to the family, the National Park Service said in a  tweet welcoming its 412th site. LGBT rights advocacy groups hailed the national recognition, saying it will help highlight the gay communities continued struggles, especially in the aftermath of the June 12 mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Florida that killed 49 people. This new national monument will be a source of inspiration to a new generation of Americans across the country standing up for equality and uniting to show the world that love conquers hate, Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said. The move was the latest of several steps Obama has take on  gay rights during his presidency.  In 2010, he signed a law repealing a policy that had banned gays from serving openly in the U.S. military. In 2012, he became the first president to support gay marriage, a stance he has admitted took time to evolve. His administration also supported the legal challenge that led to the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage nationwide. There is important distance yet to travel, but through political engagement and litigation, as well as individual acts of courage and acceptance, this movement has made tremendous progress toward securing equal rights and equal dignity, Obama said in a proclamation officially designating the historic site. The events of late June and early July 1969 in New York helped start the modern American gay rights movement. A week of violent clashes on Christopher Street between patrons of the Stonewall Inn and police, who had periodically raided the bar, arresting gays under morals laws of the era, became known as the Stonewall riots. The crackdown was also tied up in a dispute between the Mafia, which owned the bar, and corrupt police officers seeking payoffs for protection. But it unleashed a year of protests, culminating with the first gay pride parade in 1970. This years weekend LGBT pride festivities started in New York on Friday with a street fair and were to culminate with Sundays parade through Lower Manhattan. Events were scheduled across the country in San Francisco, Minneapolis, Oklahoma City and elsewhere. Obamas designation protects about 7.7 acres (3.1 hectares) of land, including the Stonewall Inn and nearby Christopher Park. U.S. lawmakers representing New York, in a statement, called the site a beacon for liberation. It drew renewed attention in the wake of this months massacre in Orlando at another gay venue, a nightclub called Pulse. Mourners in New York flocked to the inn and created a makeshift memorial after the shooting, the worst such attack in modern U.S. history.  In honor of the new monument, the White House will release a video that will be played on billboards in New Yorks Times Square on Saturday. U.S. officials will also hold a designation ceremony at Stonewall on Monday. ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 ",1
Could Brexit vote be a preview of U.S. presidential race?,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Britains stunning vote to leave the European Union, buoyed by a frenzy of nationalism and populist anger, was a crushing rejection of the political elite. Republican Donald Trump hopes it is also a preview of Novembers U.S. presidential election. The referendum result reverberated immediately in a U.S. presidential campaign dominated by Trumps rapid rise to capture the nomination, fueled by a similar brew of anti-establishment and anti-globalization sentiment. The vote in Britain reinforced the notion that the insurgent campaign launched by the wealthy real estate developer had tapped into a global political movement that might be hard to stop. This is a protest vote against globalization and there is one presidential candidate who won the nomination who has put globalization in his crosshairs - and thats Donald Trump, Republican strategist John Feehery said. Trump, who has spent much of his campaign warning of the dangers posed by immigrants who illegally enter from Mexico and proposing a temporary ban on U.S. entry for Muslims, has matched the global mood with his rhetoric. There are swaths of the population around the world who are struggling economically in the current economy, and groping for targets of blame, said Katherine Cramer, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Trump and the Brexit vote offer up tangible targets, and it is not surprising that people grab onto them. The vote yesterday is a reminder that Trump could very well win the presidential election, she said. A Brexit supporter, Trump was happy to note the parallels to his own campaign when he reopened his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, on Friday. Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton bemoaned the result. The referendum, which most British opinion polls had predicted was headed to defeat, was a wake-up call for Democrats who have been heartened by Clintons lead over Trump in opinion polls of late. I woke up this morning a little dismayed, said Democratic strategist Dane Strother. The question is whether Trump is similarly underperforming in the polls here. If that under-polled anger was present in Britain, as a Democrat you have to hope it isnt mirrored here. Global stock markets wobbled immediately after the vote, which experts warned could trigger a global recession and weaken the U.S. economy. British Prime Minister David Cameron, who said after the vote he could step down by October, presents a cautionary lesson for Clinton as she prepares to face Trump. British voters ignored repeated warnings from Cameron about the dire consequences of a departure from the European Union. Clinton can take advantage of the unsettled global mood without indulging in predictions of doom or the over-the-top rhetoric that sometimes has set back Trump, Republican strategist Rich Galen said. She can reflect some of the same sentiment that Trump and the Brexit forces tapped into but use it to her advantage, Galen said. She is not going to, and doesnt want to, out-Trump Trump, but the idea is to say, I understand these concerns. Clinton adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters after the vote that she has a real confidence that Americans are generous, tolerant, big-hearted people who believe that the country is stronger together. Theyre going to watch what impact (the Brexit vote) ends up having on the U.K. and on the British economy and come November, they are going to make their own decision about the kind of leadership that theyre looking for, he said. Differences between the electorates in the United Kingdom and the United States are one reason the Brexit sentiment may not translate fully into success for Trump.  About 30 million votes were cast in the last British general election in 2015, with about 10 percent of those cast by minority voters. Polling in the UK ahead of the Brexit vote suggested broad support for staying in the EU among those voters. By contrast, according to the Pew Research Center, nonwhite voters constituted 26 percent of all voters in the 2012 U.S. general election  and by a huge margin they backed Democratic President Barack Obama. Pew projects that by November, nearly one in three voters will be a minority, and opinion polls show Trump struggling with those blocs. Just being more mature, experienced and sympathetic than Trump may not be enough for Clinton. The argument is you need a responsible grownup, but a large part of the world doesnt want a responsible grownup, said Tom Rath, a New Hampshire-based Republican strategist. I dont think its enough to say I know all the stuff he doesnt or hes rash, because right now people arent filtering that through. ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 ",1
UK 'Leave' vote deflates hopes for U.S.-EU trade deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Britains looming exit from the European Union is another huge setback for negotiations on a massive U.S.-EU free trade deal that were already stalled by deeply entrenched differences and growing anti-trade sentiment on both sides of the Atlantic.  The historic divorce launched by Thursdays vote will almost certainly further delay substantial progress in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) talks as the remaining 27 EU states sort out their own new relationship with Britain, trade experts said on Friday.  With French and German officials increasingly voicing skepticism about TTIPs chances for success, the United Kingdoms departure from the deal could sink hopes of a deal before President Barack Obama leaves office in January. This is yet another reason why TTIP will likely be postponed, said Heather Conley, European program director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington. But to be honest, TTIP isnt going anywhere, I believe, before 2018 at the earliest, she said. U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said in a statement on Friday that he was evaluating the UK decisions impact on TTIP, but would continue to engage with both European and UK counterparts.     The importance of trade and investment is indisputable in our relationships with both the European Union and the United Kingdom, Froman said. The economic and strategic rationale for T-TIP remains strong. TTIP negotiators are still expected to meet in Brussels in mid-July as scheduled, but those talks were aimed at focusing on less controversial issues while leaving the thorniest disagreements for U.S. and EU political leaders to resolve. And it is unclear when Britain will launch formal separation proceedings, which will take at least two years. But analysts said both sides have been reluctant to put their best offers on the table with a new U.S. president due to take office in January and French and German leadership elections nearing in 2017. The Brexit also will preoccupy EU officials in coming months as they launch their own negotiations with London over the future terms of UK-EU trade, and sort out their post-Brexit priorities, said Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy, a Brussels-based think tank.     Britains departure could leave U.S. negotiators facing a European side that is more dug-in on some issues, said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank in Washington. As the UK is part of the coalition of liberal trading economies in the EU, the U.S. is losing one of the more like-minded countries from the group in Brussels sitting on the other side of the negotiating table, said Bown, a former World Bank economist. However, Lee-Makiyama, who also sees little chance of a deal before 2018, said Britains departure could eliminate one source of disagreement because the UK has insisted on a financial services chapter in the trade deal. The only real proponent of banking regulation in TTIP is the UK. Germany and France are probably willing to let it go, he said. It still leaves about 20 outstanding issues at nearly the same level of difficulty. The TTIP negotiations, which started three years ago, have unable to settle major differences over agriculture, where the EU side has shown little willingness to alter food safety rules that prohibit American beef raised with hormones or genetically modified foods, or open its closely guarded geographical food naming rules, such as for Asiago and feta cheeses. European negotiators have complained that the United States has offered too little to open up its vast federal, state and local government procurement markets to European vendors with Buy American preferences in place. Europe also wants access to key U.S. sectors such as maritime transport and aviation, while American negotiators have been frustrated over lack of access to some 200 European sectors ranging from healthcare to education. The two sides also are far apart on how to resolve disputes. The U.S. side favors a traditional binding arbitration approach, while the Europeans want a court-like system that allows for appeals. More progress has been made on harmonizing regulations for things like car seat belt anchors, clothes labeling and pharmaceutical inspections. ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 ",1

"For Donald Trump, going on about golf is par for the course","TURNBERRY, Scotland (Reuters) - Donald Trump flew all night from New York to Scotland to talk about his renovated Turnberry golf course and, given the chance to open up on the topic, he was rhapsodic. At a news conference, the Republicans opening ode to Turnberry was what greeted American cable TV viewers as they woke to the news that Britain had voted to part ways with the European Union. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee talked plenty about the Brexit vote.  But since his event was to mark the reopening of a resort where the Open Championship has been staged four times, he first reviewed the improvements at holes 9, 10 and 11, the sprinkler system, the lighthouse, the resort hotel, and he name-checked golf legends Tom Watson, Jack Nicklaus and Nick Price. This hole is an example, said Trump, standing on the 9th tee. From approximately this area, you would hit over there ... Now youre hitting out over the ocean. And just to the right of the lighthouse, you have a green, and a lot of people think this will be the greatest par 3 anywhere in the world. And then 10 becomes a par 5, he said. Trump quickly dispensed with a protester who emerged from the audience to hold up a package of red golf balls emblazoned with Nazi swastikas. Get him out of here, Trump said, a refrain that he frequently uses when protesters are escorted by security from his rallies back home. More appreciated by Trump were the two bagpipers in kilts who accompanied him. Everyone at his event knew he was about to arrive because they could hear the skirling of the pipes before he appeared from behind a grassy hill. Were just waiting on Donald Trump. His arrival is imminent. We can see the bagpipers, said one TV broadcaster. Having never held public office, Trump does not have a list of political victories to tout on the campaign trail. With his business skills, Trump says, he can work to improve Americas rundown roads and bridges and negotiate better deals on issues as diverse as trade and Irans nuclear program. Trump delights in talking about his projects. His makeover of Washingtons Old Post Office into a luxury Trump hotel, for example, is way ahead of schedule. He is less enthusiastic about raising money for his campaign and the Republican National Committee. I dont like doing it, he said. But true to his nature, Trump averred he was good at it. You know, I sit with 20 people, and we talk, and they all hand you checks, bing, bing, bing, he said. ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 ",1
Bipartisan U.S. House members vow to keep gun control fight alive,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Friday pledged to build support in the U.S. House of Representatives for legislation keeping firearms from people on terrorism watch lists, despite repeated gun control failures this week in Congress. The Terrorist Firearms Prevention Act was introduced by nine House members representing diverse states stretching from Hawaii to Delaware, including some who have led the gun control fight for years. If you cant get on a plane because of the danger that may pose, there is no reason you should be able to purchase a dangerous weapon, said Republican Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida, in a refrain that has ricocheted through the U.S. Capitol since the June 12 mass shooting in Orlando. The legislation, identical to a bill by Senator Susan Collins of Maine that was debated on the Senate floor on Thursday, would halt sales of weapons to people on a no-fly list barring them from boarding airplanes, or a Selectee list in which they are subjected to special airport screenings. Over the past two weeks, the Senate failed to advance this or several other proposals placing new constraints on gun sales, as the U.S. mourned the deaths of 49 people killed at an Orlando nightclub with 53 others injured. Curbelo said he met with House Speaker Paul Ryans top aide to inform him of the bill. The lawmaker left that meeting with no assurances it would advance, but simply no objection from the speakers office to the legislation being introduced, Curbelo said. He added that the bills sponsors now must build support amongst our colleagues in a House that has a concentration of conservative Republicans opposed to most gun control ideas. Many Republicans have argued that travelers can mistakenly be placed on terrorism watch lists and denying them the ability to buy weapons would stomp on their constitutional rights. We cannot let that argument stop, into perpetuity, our ability to advance wise legislation in this matter, countered    Republican Representative Scott Rigell of Virginia. Rigell, a co-sponsor of the bill, introduced himself to reporters at a press conference as a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, which lobbies against gun controls,  and an owner of 10 firearms, including an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle that is similar to the weapon used by Omar Mateen, the Orlando shooter.

"Trump's ""unlimited"" wealth may not be enough to fund his campaign","LONDON (Reuters) - New York real estate developer Donald Trump says he has unlimited personal wealth to fund his White House run, but a Reuters review of his financial disclosures suggests he does not have enough cash to see his campaign through to Election Day. Trump this week dismissed concerns about his campaign finances after electoral filings showed he raised just $3 million in individual contributions in May and had a war chest of only $1 million at the end of the month. His Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, raised $26 million and ended May with a war chest of $42 million.  Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee who says he is worth about $10 billion, said in a statement on Tuesday that if need be, there could be unlimited cash on hand as I would put up my own money.  Trump had cash and other liquid investments - money in funds, equities and cash - worth $60 million to $180 million in May, according to his filings with the Office of Government Ethics. The form does not require candidates to give precise values for their assets, only ranges. If President Barack Obamas spending in his successful re-election bid in 2012 election is any guide, then Trump is a few hundred million dollars short. Obama spent almost $600 million between June and November 2012, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Trumps campaign declined to comment for this story but referred to his earlier statement, in which he said his White House bid costs less than a traditional one because it is leaner and more efficient.  If Trump did decide to self-finance his campaign, he could, in theory, tap the hundreds of millions dollars of revenue he says is generated annually by his businesses. But its not clear how much of this revenue he could use. Business owners can take money out of a business only after deducting operating costs and taxes. Even then, much of an entrepreneurs corporate earnings are often used to invest in building their businesses and maintaining their property assets.  Trumps liquid assets stood at $80 million to $230 million in July last year, according to an earlier electoral filing. Using the midpoint of the ranges, Trumps liquid assets have fallen$35 million in the past year.  The drop shows his campaign spending so far has already been funded in part by dipping into savings, rather than solely from his income. There is a real question about how much he has in terms of liquid assets, said Norman Ornstein, a political scholar and expert in political finance at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, citing the regulatory filings, which do not give a precise picture of Trumps wealth. Its quite possible that he doesnt have anywhere near what he suggests he has and what he does have is tied up in real estate, and selling that is no easy task, he said.  As a result, a more likely scenario would be Trump trying to borrow the funds, which could be probably done more quickly than trying to sell one of his buildings, he added.  Jan Baran, a former general counsel with the Republican National Committee, said Trump may not need as much money as people think. Hes breaking the mold on everything ... he has proven that spending large sums of money does not guarantee success, Baran said, referring to how Trump defeated well-funded Republican rivals such as former Florida Governor Jeb Bush in the early nominating contests, or primaries. If Trump does not use his own money, he can seek donations, the traditional fund-raising route. Individual donors can contribute $2,700 each to his general election campaign. Trump has also signed a joint fundraising agreement with the  Republican National Committee. The RNC currently has $20 million in cash, money that will be used to help elect Trump and Republican lawmakers across the country.  Trump could also benefit if external groups like Super PACs raise money to campaign on his behalf. However, Trump has not yet blessed a Super PAC. Trump has spent around $63 million so far in his presidential bid, including $46 million in loans he made to his campaign, FERC data shows.  Typically, television advertising and creating infrastructure at a state and local level to mobilize voters are the most expensive aspects of a U.S. presidential campaign. TV networks charge high fees for prime time slots and many ground troops needed to bring out the voters must be paid.  So far Trump has not needed to spend much on television advertising - his fiery rhetoric on illegal immigrants and what he says are the security risks posed by refugees from the Middle East have guaranteed him blanket media coverage.  Daniel Weiner, a campaign finance expert at New York Universitys Brennan Center for Justice said you can get only so far with free media in an election. TV advertising has been decreasing in importance for a long time, but the get-out-the vote stuff is crucial, particularly in an election that people perceive as being more about motivating their core voters, as opposed to winning over swing voters. And what we call the ground game is quite expensive, he said. Trump has said he plans to outsource some of that ground game to the RNC, for example relying on their field staff in battleground states to help get out the vote. Trump has significant real estate holdings, which he says have low debt on them. With Election Day on Nov. 8 now just four months away, some real estate experts say selling them to generate cash would be a challenge. But several bankers say Trump could conceivably borrow hundreds of millions against them, despite his history of business bankruptcies and litigation with lenders. Exactly how much he could borrow, how easily and at what interest rates depends on how much Trump owns of the buildings that he cites as his own and how much debt he has. You have years of prosperity and you have all of these alternative lenders and you have banks that are hungry for loans, said one veteran banking executive, who was not permitted to speak on the record. If Trump needs to borrow tens of millions of dollars, he probably can, the executive said. If it is hundreds of millions, thats another matter. ",politicsNews,"June 23, 2016 ",1
"Cleveland, ACLU agree on protest limits at Republican convention","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - The city of Cleveland and the American Civil Liberties Union on Friday settled a federal lawsuit over free speech limits outside the Republican National Convention next month, setting the stage for lively demonstrations during Donald Trumps big moment. The city had been seeking a restricted zone of 3.3 square miles (8.5 square km) around the Quicken Loans Arena, site of the convention, where free speech and mobility would be limited. That prompted an ACLU lawsuit on behalf of three protest groups that argued the so-called event zone was too large and the security regulations too strict. Details of the new event zone and protest rules were not immediately available. Today, counsel advised me that the case is settled and that they will execute a settlement agreement expeditiously, U.S. District Judge Dan Aaron Polster said in a statement. Another judge on Thursday had struck down Clevelands plan for placing limits on protests, issuing a preliminary injunction in favor of the ACLU and referring the case to Polster for mediation. Trump is expected to become the Republican Partys official nominee for president at the July 18-21 convention, which will attract protesters for various causes who plan to demonstrate outside. Trump campaign events have drawn large and raucous demonstrations with some resulting in clashes between the candidates supporters and opponents. The plaintiffs in the Cleveland lawsuit are Citizens for Trump, a Texas-based group that supports the wealthy businessmans campaign; Organize Ohio, a liberal activist group; and Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless, a charitable organization. Citizens for Trump anticipates 104 cars and trucks, 100 motorcycles, four horses and at least 5,000 people to participate in its event, while Organize Ohio expects 3,000 to 5,000 marchers, the ACLU said.

"Ryan, House Republicans offer plan to slice U.S. tax rates","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives said on Friday  they would advance legislation next year to chop individual and corporate U.S. tax rates. The tax plan, unveiled by House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republican lawmakers at the U.S. Capitol, is the sixth and final plank of a conservative policy agenda being rolled out in an effort to unify Republicans after a divisive primary campaign for the partys presidential nominee. Ryan, the highest-ranking elected Republican, said the proposal would provide a clear direction for U.S. economic leadership and was needed amid global uncertainty that was exemplified by the British vote to leave the European Union. For all of these moments of possible uncertainty that are happening around the globe, having strong, powerful, confident, American economic leadership is in need, and this does that, he said. Washington has been unable to summon the political will to reform the loophole-riddled tax code for nearly three decades. Overhauling the code has long been a goal of Ryan, a self-described policy wonk. He was considered the Republican Partys leading voice on taxes and budgets before he ascended to the job of speaker last year. But the labor powerhouse AFL-CIO scorned the Republican blueprint as similar to a tax-cutting proposal made last year by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who Ryan recently endorsed. Ryan and Trump have striking resemblance - both tax plans benefit the wealthy & corps a lot, the AFL-CIO said on Twitter.  Trumps ideas about taxes have appeared contradictory at times. He said in May he is open to raising taxes on the rich, backing off prior proposals to reduce taxes on all Americans and corporations by slashing rates even more deeply than Ryan and House Republicans would. Democrats, including presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, have pressed for increased taxes on the wealthiest Americans for years. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the Republican plan as massive tax giveaways to millionaires and billionaires on the backs of hard-working American families. The plan would consolidate the current seven tax brackets for individuals to three, and lower the top individual income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent, higher than the 25 percent that Ryan proposed when he chaired the House Budget Committee.  Ryan said the goal was to make things so simple the average American could do their taxes on a postcard. The plan would lead to a maximum tax rate of 25 percent on small business income. It would also lower the top U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent, the highest in the industrialized world, to 20 percent, as well as shift to a territorial style tax system aimed at exempting the earnings of American companies abroad from U.S. taxation. The blueprint also calls for overhauling the tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service, an idea that animates many conservatives who have called for its abolition. ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 ",1
Rationale for U.S.-EU trade deal still strong after Brexit vote: USTR,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Even after Britains vote to leave the European Union, the case for a U.S. free trade deal with the EU remains strong, the top U.S. trade official said on Friday. The economic and strategic rationale for T-TIP remains strong, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said in a statement, referring to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership being negotiated by Washington and the EU. We are evaluating the impact of the United Kingdoms decision on T-TIP and look forward to continuing our engagement with the European Union and our relations with the United Kingdom, Froman said.

White House unveils measures to help inmates find work after prison,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Friday rolled out a series of education and work training initiatives focused on helping convicted criminals avoid returning to prison, part of President Barack Obamas legacy-shaping effort to overhaul the U.S. criminal justice system as he prepares to leave office. The measures include a program that will link 67 colleges and universities with 141 correctional facilities to provide education and training to about 12,000 inmates. The program will offer federal Pell grants to prisoners, with an emphasis on inmates set to be released within five years of starting classes. The bottom line is that our communities are less safe when the stigma of incarceration prevents Americans from truly ever shedding their prison jumpsuit, White House senior adviser  Valerie Jarrett said on a call with reporters. When people leave prisons and cant turn their lives around, they too often end up back behind bars, she said. Other programs unveiled on Friday will offer $31 million in grants for organizations to offer occupational training and apprenticeship opportunities for young adults and more than $5 million to organizations that help inmates prepare for employment. Obamas top cabinet members for justice, education, labor and housing praised the reentry initiatives as common-sense reforms that should have been in place long ago. All the little things that people take for granted generate tremendous obstacles for people who are coming out of the criminal justice system, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said at a panel hosted by the left-leaning Center for American Progress think tank. Obtaining photo identification or being considered for job opportunities were two examples. In order to compete, you have to be allowed in the arena, she added. Hiring people with a criminal history is not an act of charity, it is an act of enlightened self-interest, Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said, commending Marylands largest private employer, the Johns Hopkins Hospital, for employing so many people with criminal backgrounds. Despite bipartisan support for reform of mandatory minimum sentences for some non-violent federal drug offenders, legislation addressing the issue has stalled in Congress. Jarrett said the White House remains hopeful that criminal justice reform will be approved by lawmakers. We would like to see those bills move forward as quickly as possible, she said. We are going to do everything we can to work with members on both sides of the aisle to make sure it comes to fruition. ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 ",1
Donald Trump heads for Scotland to reopen a golf resort,"GLASGOW, Scotland (Reuters) - Most U.S. presidential candidates go abroad to sharpen their foreign policy credentials. Donald Trump arrives in Scotland on Friday to reopen a golf resort. The presumptive Republican nominee, 70, visits his familys ancestral homeland to showcase his far-flung business empire. His mother was born on Scotlands Isle of Lewis. With a throng of reporters watching, he will make a dramatic arrival by helicopter at his seaside Trump Turnberry resort. He has scheduled a news conference on the 9th hole at noon (7 a.m. ET/1100 GMT). His visit to Turnberry, to be followed by a stop at his resort in Aberdeen on Saturday, will allow him to comment on the outcome of Britains vote on Thursday on whether to remain in the European Union. I dont think opening a golf resort gets you many foreign policy chops, said Saul Anuzis, former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. But since hes there right in the middle of the EU vote, it may end up being a PR bonanza for him. The risk is that the real-estate tycoon, who has yet to hold public office and rates unfavorably with 70 percent of Americans in an opinion poll, will make a foreign policy misstep at a time when Republican leaders are urging a more serious demeanor. Trump has said he would be inclined to leave the EU. He has exchanged insults with British Prime Minister David Cameron, who has called the New Yorkers anti-immigrant policy ideas divisive and wrong. There are no plans for the two to meet. His trip has baffled Republican officials who say he should concentrate on strengthening his campaign and taking the fight to the presumptive Democratic nominee, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is 68. Trump defeated a crowded field of opponents for the Republican nomination but has faced one controversy after another, the latest over his firing of his campaign manager this week, a month before the party convention. His campaign has got all kinds of growing pains and it doesnt make sense that he would spend any kind of time going out of the country, said David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University.  Turnberry is a storied course where the Open Championship has been staged four times. Trump invested $290 million in renovating the resort and golf course on Scotlands West Coast 85 km (53 miles) southwest of Glasgow. He has portrayed his determination to build up courses in Turnberry and Aberdeen and overcome local opposition as an example of the type of leadership skills that Americans would get if he wins the White House on Nov. 8. Well, Scotland has already been won  and so will the United States, Trump wrote in a column for The Press and Journal newspaper in Aberdeen. An Aberdeen family opposed to his development there has threatened to raise a Mexican flag as a reminder of his proposal to build a wall along the U.S. southern border to keep out immigrants who enter illegally. The last Republican presidential nominee, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, in 2012 made a gaffe-filled campaign trip to London, Jerusalem and Poland. ",politicsNews,"June 24, 2016 ",1
