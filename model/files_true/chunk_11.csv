"Arizona man challenges primary results, alleging misconduct ","PHOENIX (Reuters) - An Arizona man filed a lawsuit on Friday challenging the results of the states March presidential primary election, alleging misconduct by officials during a nominating contest that is already mired in controversy. The lawsuit filed by Tucson resident John Brakey alleges that officials improperly handled voter registration requests and permitted illegal votes to be cast in the election, which was marred by long lines at polling stations and allegations of discrimination against minority voters. The three-count complaint, filed late on Friday afternoon against Arizonas secretary of state and 15 counties, also claims that erroneous ballots were counted by officials on election day. It seeks to enjoin the state from certifying the results until such election is properly conducted and in compliance with every requirement of Arizona law, according to the lawsuit. The legal action comes amid an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into the elections handling by Maricopa County officials that saw outraged votes wait up to five hours to cast their ballots at polls. Some county residents waited long after the polls had officially closed and projected results announced to vote at one of 60 election sites, a reduced number of locations made in cost-cutting efforts by officials. Two hundred polls were set up for the same election in 2012. Officials immediately took the blame for misjudging the number of people who would show up at the polls to cast ballots, saying that their decision were based on turnout history and an increase in mail-in voters. U.S. Justice Department officials are investigating whether federal voting laws were violated after complaints of long lines at polling stations and allegations that there was disproportionate waiting times in areas with high numbers of minority people. Maricopa County officials have until April 22 to respond to the questions from the head of the voting section of the departments civil rights division. Such an investigation was requested by Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, who called the March 22 election won by Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump a fiasco that was unacceptable. A hearing on the lawsuit has been set for April 19.

Vatican trip could boost Sanders' fight against Clinton,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders will  speak at an event in the Vatican next week, likely broadening his appeal to Catholic voters ahead of crucial nominating contests in a series of Northeastern states. Like Pope Francis, Sanders has made economic inequality and the plight of the working class a central tenet of his message. Sanders April 15 visit to Vatican City, where he will give an economic address at a conference, will come just days before Democrats in New York vote in their state primary. The trip may help the U.S. senator amplify the anti-corporate line of attack he has employed against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton as he tries to keep his insurgent campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election alive.  Sanders, who would be the first Jewish U.S. president if elected, described himself on MSNBC as a big, big fan of the pope, who leads the worlds 1.2 billion Catholics. Speaking to reporters in New York later, Sanders said he hoped to meet with Francis.  The popes schedule is determined by the Vatican but I would certainly be enthusiastic about that, said Sanders, 74, the Brooklyn-born son of Polish-Jewish immigrants.  A meeting with the Argentine pontiff could provide an electoral boost to Sanders, who has trailed former Secretary of State Clinton in support among Americas Catholic Democrats. Pope Francis has criticized the make money at all cost capitalist mentality and called for more compassion for the poor, said Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist in Washington. Thats exactly the way, Bernie Sanders wants to define his campaign against Clinton.         Clinton has scored victories over Sanders in Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, and Texas, all of which are more than one-quarter Catholic.  A survey by the Pew Research Center earlier this year found that while almost 70 percent of Catholic Democrats thought Clinton would make a good president, just 46 percent thought Sanders would be one. This is a great play for Sanders because it ties directly his messaging related to income equality, it puts him on the world stage as a leader, and it does it with an institution and leader important to a key voting bloc in a state where every vote is going to count heading into the primary, said Virginia-based Democratic strategist Bud Jackson.  Sanders was invited to speak at the Vatican event by the Vatican, a senior papal official said, denying a report that Sanders had invited himself. I deny that. It was not that way, Monsignor Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo told Reuters. Sorondo, a close aide to Pope Francis, is chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, which is hosting the event. Late April brings nominating contests in Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island, all states with large populations of Catholic voters. Sanders victory earlier this week over Clinton in the Wisconsin primary marked his sixth win in the past seven contests, sparking renewed talk of Clintons political vulnerability despite her substantial delegate lead. Sanders this week said Clinton, who is also a former first lady and former U.S. senator, was not qualified to be president. After heavy criticism from Clintons campaign and other Democrats, he backed off Friday morning in an interview on NBCs Today.  On her worst day, she would be an infinitely better president than either of the Republican candidates, he said, referring to New York developer Donald Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Clinton has been under fire from progressives since her campaign began. On Thursday, her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had a testy exchange at a campaign rally in Philadelphia with protestors from the Black Lives Matter movement over the effects of an anti-crime bill passed during his presidency.  At one point, Bill Clinton accused the movement of defending the people who kill the lives you say matter.  On Friday, he seemed regretful. I rather vigorously defended my wife, as I am wont to do, and I realized, finally, I was talking past her (the protestor) the same way she was talking past me, Clinton said at an event in Erie, Pennsylvania. We have got to stop that in this country. Weve got to listen to each other again.   In the Republican race, Trump extended his lead nationally over Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll. The national online poll showed that 42 percent of Republicans support Trump, compared with 32 percent for Cruz and 20 percent for Kasich.           ",politicsNews,"April 8, 2016 ",1
Exclusive: Blocking Trump could hurt Republicans in election - Reuters/Ipsos poll,"(Reuters) - A third of Republican voters who support Donald Trump could turn their backs on their party in Novembers presidential election if he is denied the nomination in a contested convention, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. The results are bad news for Trumps rivals as well as party elites opposed to the real estate billionaire, suggesting that an alternative Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential race would have a tougher road against the Democrats. If its a close election, this is devastating news for the Republicans, said Donald Green, an expert on election turnout at Columbia University.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted March 30 to April 8 asked Trumps Republican supporters two questions: if Trump wins the most delegates in the primaries but loses the nomination, what would they do on Election Day, and how would it impact their relationship with the Republican Party? Sixty-six percent said they would vote for the candidate who eventually wins the nomination, while the remaining third were split between a number of alternatives such as not voting, supporting a third-party candidate, and switching parties and voting for the Democratic nominee.  Meanwhile, 58 percent said they would remain with the Republican Party. Another 16 percent said they would leave it, and 26 percent said they did not know what they would do with their registration. The online poll of 468 Republican Trump supporters has a credibility interval of 5.3 percentage points. (Click here for the poll results: tmsnrt.rs/25PRLZe ) Trump has topped the national polls throughout most of the race for the Republican nomination, and has won more delegates than any other Republican so far. A Reuters/Ipsos online poll from April 4-8 showed that 42 percent of Republicans support Trump, compared with 32 percent for U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and 20 percent for Ohio Governor John Kasich. [L2N17B1J0] Cruz and Kasich have both said their paths to victory rely on winning at least enough votes to block an outright win for Trump and force a decision at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. But Trump, whose supporters have remained loyal even as he rankled women, Hispanics, Muslims, veterans and others with his fiery rhetoric on the campaign trail, predicted last month there would be riots outside the convention if he was blocked. If they broker him out, Ill be fed up with the Republicans, said Chuck Thompson, 66, a Trump supporter from Concord, North Carolina, who took the poll.  Thompson, a lifelong Republican, said he admires Trumps independence from big campaign donors and takes that as a sign that the front-runner will be able to think for himself if he were to become president.  If Trump loses the nomination, Thompson said he would quit the party. The people want Donald Trump. If they (Republicans) cant deal with that, I dont need them, he said. Green said the departure of even a small number of Republicans would make it tough for the party to prevent the Democrats from winning the White House, especially if the election is again decided by razor-thin margins in a handful of battleground states.  In 2012, President Barack Obama won Florida by less than 1 percentage point and Ohio and Virginia by less than 4 percentage points. The Republicans dont really have any margin of error, Green said. Trump and Cruz both trail Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton among likely general election voters in a hypothetical general election matchup, but not by much, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos polls. Generally, a convention battle is a bad sign for the health of a political party, said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of the book, Primary Politics: How Presidential Candidates Have Shaped the Modern Nominating System.  When a party gets to a point when it has a contested convention, it almost always hurts them, Kamarck said. Its a confirmation of some really deep fissures within the party that were unable to be dealt with during the primary season. Trump supporter Elizabeth Oerther, 40, of Louisville, Kentucky, said she would switch parties and vote for the Democratic nominee if the Republicans denied Trump the nomination.  If you dont give it to him, Im going to vote against them, said Oerther, who took the poll. They want to take away the choice of the people. Thats wrong. ",politicsNews,"April 9, 2016 ",1
Prosecutors say ex-House Speaker Hastert sexually abused boys,"(Reuters) - Former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, convicted last year of a financial crime in a hush-money case, had agreed to pay $3.5 million to buy the silence of an individual who he sexually abused when the victim was a teenager, federal prosecutors said on Friday. It was the first time that prosecutors, in a new court filing, had said that Hastert had been extorted to keep quiet allegations he sexually abused a 14-year-old victim decades ago. In the filing the prosecutors accuse Hastert, 74, of molesting several boys when he was a high school teacher and coach in his hometown of Yorkville, Illinois in the 1960s and 1970s.  Though the statute of limitations has expired on prosecuting Hastert for sex abuse, with this case the government seeks to hold defendant accountable for the crimes he committed that can still be prosecuted, the prosecutors said in the filing. The former Republican speaker of the House of Representatives has admitted to paying $1.7 million in cash to someone he had known for decades to buy that persons silence and compensate for past misconduct toward that individual.    Hasterts lawyers have not revealed the misconduct at issue. There was no immediate response to an email to one of his attorneys, Thomas Green, seeking comment on the details in the prosecutors filing. Hastert faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison when sentenced later this month for his guilty plea in October to a federal charge of structuring - evading bank reporting rules by withdrawing large amounts of cash in small increments. On Wednesday, his attorneys urged a federal judge to spare him prison time for health reasons and because he is deeply sorry.     Prosecutors have recommended a prison term of no more than six months in exchange for Hasterts guilty plea. The defense asked that he be sentenced to probation only, citing his deteriorating medical condition. Hastert is scheduled to be sentenced on April 27, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Senate primary-race pressures work against Obama's court nominee,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama is maintaining pressure on the Senate to approve his Supreme Court nominee, but the need for Republican U.S. senators seeking re-election to keep conservative voters happy before primary elections in the coming months is working against him. From April 26 to Sept. 13, nine states where incumbent Republicans grip on U.S. Senate seats is tenuous will hold party primaries ahead of the Nov. 8 congressional and presidential elections. During that period, Republicans seem unlikely to break with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells hard-line stance against holding confirmation hearings or a vote on Obamas nominee, appellate judge Merrick Garland. McConnell has insisted that Obamas successor, to be elected in November and take office in January, should fill the vacancy left by Februarys death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Republicans are hoping their partys candidate wins the presidency and can make the appointment. A Supreme Court appointment requires Senate confirmation. Voicing support for holding Garland hearings during the primary season, political experts say, could enrage conservatives already upset over the prospect of Obama making a third lifetime appointment to the nine-member court, which could give the bench a liberal tilt for the first time in decades. That anger could bolster primary candidates challenging incumbent Republicans from the right or encourage new challengers to come forward. Political science professor Sheldon Goldman of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who has tracked Supreme Court nominations since the 1960s, said of the Garland fight: The real obstacle is getting over the primaries. The danger of straying from McConnells blockade was illustrated when Kansas Republican Jerry Moran last month backed hearings on Garland but reversed course after rumblings of a right-wing challenge materializing in Morans Aug. 2 primary. Other key battlegrounds for Senate Republicans include Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida and New Hampshire. New Hampshires Kelly Ayotte is viewed as one of the most vulnerable Senate Republican incumbents. Ayotte will meet with Garland but said she wants the Senate to wait until after Novembers elections to act on the nomination. Arizona Senator John McCain, facing at least two opponents in his Aug. 30 Republican primary, downplayed the political difficulties presented by Garlands nomination. He said when he was home during the recent Senate recess, he heard few complaints. Of his constituents, McCain said, They would ask. I would explain. Obama and fellow Democrats in the Senate continue to press Republicans to allow hearings by summer. So what you have here is, I think, a circumstance in which those (Republicans) in the Senate have decided that placating our base is more important than upholding their constitutional and institutional roles in our democracy in a way that is dangerous, Obama said in Chicago on Thursday. Some Democrats think McConnells gambit gives them a campaign issue for the elections. Dick Durbin, the Senates No. 2 Democrat, said, If there was any question about obstruction in the United States Senate, whats happening with the vacancy on the Supreme Court is Exhibit A of Republican obstructionism.

"Obama says Trump, Cruz doing Democrats a 'favor'","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Friday told donors that Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz were doing Democrats a favor by exposing extreme views within their party on issues such as immigration and national security. I actually think that Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have done us a favor, Obama said, referring to policy positions that would restrict Muslims and Mexicans from entering the country. Obama said Trump and Cruz, the two front-runners in the Republican nomination contest ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election, have upset mainstream establishment Republicans with their insurgent campaigns. But he told about 100 people at the annual signature fundraising dinner for Nancy Pelosi, Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, that Trump had laid bare what some in the Republican party had been saying for years. He said, You know what? I can deliver this message with more flair, with more panache, Obama said. Speaking in an opulent two-storey atrium with marble pillars in the home of billionaire oil heirs Gordon and Ann Getty, where donors paid $33,400 per couple to benefit the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Obama mocked Trump. In 10 months, I will no longer be president of the United States. But in 10 months, I will - contrary to Mr. Trumps opinion - still be a citizen of the United States, he said, drawing laughter and cheers from the crowd. Trump had long raised questions about whether Obama, who was born in Hawaii, was actually born outside the United States. It was Obamas fourth stop on a fundraising swing through San Francisco and Los Angeles. Earlier, in San Francisco, Obama held a private roundtable at the Potrero Hill home of Susan Sandler and Steve Philips for the Democratic National Committee with about 25 people who paid up to $33,400 to attend. He started Friday in Los Angeles with a breakfast event at the Brentwood home of Spiderman actor Tobey Maguire, closed to the media, where an undisclosed number of $33,400-tickets raised money for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. On Thursday, he spoke at a fundraising dinner for the DCCC in a tent with seating for about 80 people outside the Bel Air home of Alan Horn, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, and Cindy Horn, an environmental activist.

California to expand paid family leave for new parents,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California will increase the amount of money new parents can receive through the states paid family leave program under a bill to be signed on Monday by Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, his office said Friday. The measure, passed last month by the state legislature, would increase the amount paid to new parents or people caring for a sick family member to as much as 70 percent of their regular income for the poorest workers, up from 55 percent. Those earning more would still get an increase in payments, to 60 percent from 55 percent. The state also plans to eliminate a seven-day waiting period imposed on receiving the benefits. The legislation aims to help more people take family leave, especially poorer Californians who could not afford to stop work if they only got 55 percent of their regular income, according to the bills author Jimmy Gomez, a Democratic assembly member. The program, administered through the states disability system, would apply to all parents who take off time from work to bond with a child within one year of birth, adoption or placement as a foster child. It would also provide payments to people who take time to care for seriously ill family members. ",politicsNews,"April 9, 2016 ",1
U.S. needs up to 18 more Russian rocket engines: Pentagon,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon will need to buy up to 18 more Russian-built RD-180 engines to power rockets carrying U.S. military satellites into space over the next six years or so, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work said in an interview on Friday. Congress banned use of the Russian RD-180 rocket engines for military use after 2019, following Russias annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014. But U.S. lawmakers eased the ban late last year, worried that it could drive United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co, out of business and leave only privately held SpaceX to lift satellites into space. Work said the United States needed to ensure there were at least two affordable and reliable means into space. He added the RD-180 would be needed only during what he described as a transition period of new domestic rocket engine development.  We just dont see any way you can get a new engine in anything less than six years, Work said. And so, therefore, in the transition period, we believe strongly that we need RD-180 space engines. No more than 18 but, you know, thats our position. Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is pushing to end U.S. dependence on Russian engines used by United Launch Alliance to power its Atlas 5 rockets. McCain said last month that two Russians placed on the U.S. sanctions list because of events in Ukraine were leaders of Russian space agency Roscosmos, which he said was the parent of the company that makes the RD-180 rocket. ULA has said it was moving forward with two companies developing their own U.S. engines, Blue Origin and Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, but such development programs were difficult and took years to complete.

Colorado lawmaker aims to outlaw pot-laced gummy bears,"(Reuters) - A Colorado lawmaker is trying to outlaw marijuana-laced gummy candies that resemble childrens treats, the latest effort by a U.S. state to address the complexities and unintended consequences of pot legalization. In 2014 Colorado became the first state to allow the sale of marijuana for recreational use, and it has grown to be a billion dollar industry in the state. The measure by State Representative Dan Pabon, a Democrat from Denver, would prohibit edible marijuana to be sold in the form of an animal, human or fruit, common shapes for gummy candies favored by young children. Right now in Colorado, there are no distinguishing characteristics between the gummy bear that contains marijuana and one that does not, Palon said. The appeal of edible marijuana products to children has become a concern in the few U.S. states that have legalized pot in recent years. In Washington state, where legal pot has been on sale for about 18 months, regulators recently tightened the rules on edible products made with cannabis, said Rick Garza, director of the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis board. The new restrictions outlawed brightly colored marijuana lollipops and other sweets deemed to be particularly attractive to children, Gar said. Numerous children in Colorado were hospitalized after becoming critically ill as a result of ingesting edible marijuana products after pot became legal there in 2014, and lawmakers have already moved once to toughen the rules. But Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper has urged the legislature to do more, saying in his State of the State address in January that pot-laced edibles look too much like products kids can find in the candy aisle. Back in the day, candy cigarettes desensitized kids to the dangers of tobacco - and today, pot-infused gummy bears send the wrong message to our kids about marijuana, Hickenlooper said. Pabons bill, submitted on Thursday, directs the states marijuana regulatory agency to develop more detailed guidelines on how enforcing the ban on marijuana candies shaped like humans, animals or fruit would work.     Voters in four U.S. states and the District of Columbia approved ballot measures to legalize marijuana for recreational use by adults in recent years. Numerous others allow medicinal use. Advocates have pushed for similar referendums in a half-dozen other states, including California, Massachusetts and Maine. In Maine, a proposed legalization referendum advanced on Friday when a judge overruled a state officials decision invalidating some of the signatures needed to get the initiative on the ballot.

The top U.S. general, Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said he is working on options to present to Obama to increase U.S. forces in Iraq to bolster Iraqi forces preparing for a major offensive against the militant group in Mosul. Obama has held similar meetings, at the Pentagon and at the State Department, on fighting Islamic State, which holds areas of Syria and Iraq.

New Jersey's Christie loses bid to freeze Atlantic City spending,"ATLANTIC CITY (Reuters) - A New Jersey judge on Friday rejected a bid by Governor Chris Christies administration to freeze spending by cash-strapped Atlantic City, which the governor argued was needed to protect tax revenues for city schools. Superior Court Judge Julio Mendez declined to order the city to stop all spending and divert what little remaining cash it has to the school district. But the nearly insolvent seaside gambling hub could find itself back in court with the state, which sued on Monday. Both sides are due back April 19, unless the city makes its April 15 payment to the district or can reach a deal on payments. Christies move was one of several on Monday that added to Atlantic Citys woes and kicked off a week of escalating mudslinging, perhaps the worst so far during the citys recent financial crisis, in which Christie called Mayor Don Guardian a liar. That same day, Moodys Investors Service downgraded Atlantic  Citys credit rating deeper into junk territory and the Borgata Casino Hotel & Spa won the right to appeal four years of property taxes after Judge Mendez, in a separate case, found the city violated an $88.2 million settlement agreement by failing to pay.     Christie and state Senate leaders want the state to takeover city operations, saying local officials have not done enough to cut expenses as the casino industry suffered from competition in neighboring states. Guardian has called that plan a fascist dictatorship, and state Assembly leaders on Thursday advanced an alternate rescue package with softer takeover provisions. The city had expected to shut down on Friday after running out of cash. But this week its nine public sector unions agreed to convert to a monthly payroll schedule, giving the city breathing room until quarterly tax payments arrive in May. Christie said the citys paycheck-to-paycheck budgeting will leave the schools broke. The school district will not be able to operate if it does not receive the roughly $8 million a month it is owed from the city, Assistant Attorney General Dan Dryzga told the court on Friday.  The city said a payment is not due until April 15.  The schools cant operate in a vacuum without police and fire services, said Robert Tarver, an attorney representing the city. Atlantic Citys budget has been under state oversight since 2011. Guardian has said it remits payments to schools on a schedule laid out by the state. ",politicsNews,"April 8, 2016 ",1
Leak of Senate encryption bill prompts swift backlash,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Security researchers and civil liberties advocates on Friday condemned draft legislation leaked from the U.S. Senate that would let judges order technology companies to assist law enforcement agencies in breaking into encrypted data. The long-awaited bill is emerging just as the U.S. Justice Department redoubles its efforts to use the courts to force Apple to help unlock encrypted iPhones. The Senate proposal is an attempt to resolve long-standing disagreements between the technology community, which believes strong encryption is essential to keep hackers and others from disrupting the Internet, and law enforcement officials worried about being unable to pry open encrypted devices and communications of criminal suspects. But the draft bill, leaked online Thursday evening, was planned as an overly vague measure that added up to a ban on strong encryption.  Kevin Bankston, director of the Open Technology Institute, said in a statement it was the most ludicrous, dangerous, technically illiterate tech policy proposal of the 21st century. The leaked 9-page bill is the most current draft of the proposal, a source familiar with the language said.  It would give judges broad authority to order tech companies to hand over data in an intelligible format or provide technical assistance to access locked data. It does not spell out what form the data must take or under what circumstances a company would be forced to help. It also does not create specific penalties for noncompliance. In a joint statement, the authors of the bill, Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, said they were still working with stakeholders to finalize the bill, which has repeatedly been delayed.  The underlying goal is simple: when theres a court order to render technical assistance to law enforcement or provide decrypted information, that court order is carried out, they said. No individual or company is above the law. President Obama is expected to be personally briefed by White House chief of staff Denis McDonough on the proposal on Monday, sources said.  But the administration remains deeply divided over encryption and views it as too controversial to offer public support or opposition for the bill as it is currently written, according to sources. A White House spokesman told reporters Thursday the administration had not decided whether to support the measure, as it is still in a draft stage. The fight over encryption has been at the center of a months long dispute between Apple and the FBI over a phone linked to one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters. Though the Justice Department withdrew its request in that case after a secret third party provided a way to unlock the phone, it announced Friday it would move ahead with an appeal of a court ruling blocking the government from forcing Apple to help unlock an iPhone in a separate New York drug case.  The bill from Burr and Feinstein would make it much more difficult if not impossible for Apple to refuse to comply in such cases. An Apple attorney declined to comment about the draft legislation on a call with reporters.  The proposal from Burr and Feinstein, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee respectively, is expected to face a steep climb in a gridlocked U.S. Congress during an election year. For the first time in America, companies that want to protect their customers with stronger security will not have that choice, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and vocal privacy advocate told reporters Friday. They will be required by federal law per this statute to decide how to weaken their products to make Americans less safe. Matt Blaze, a professor and computer security expert at the University of Pennsylvania, said on Twitter that the bill was worse than a failed effort by President Bill Clintons administration in the 1990s to require a special computer chip in phones to give the U.S. government a way to monitor encrypted conversations. The Clinton-era push crumbled amid stiff opposition from the technology sector that included a crucial security flaw in the proposal detected by Blaze. ",politicsNews,"April 8, 2016 ",1
Papal official denies report Sanders invited himself to Vatican,"VATICAN CITY/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders was invited to speak at an April 15 Vatican event by the Vatican, a senior papal official said on Friday, denying a report that Sanders had invited himself.

An invitation to Sanders dated March 30, which was emailed to Reuters, was signed by Sorondo and also included Archers name. ",politicsNews,"April 8, 2016 ",1
Bill Clinton confronts protesters who say his crime reforms hurt blacks,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former President Bill Clinton on Thursday faced down protesters angry at the impact his 1994 crime reforms have had on black Americans and defended the record of his wife, Hillary Clinton, who is relying on the support of black voters in her quest for the presidency. The former president spent more than 10 minutes confronting the protesters at a campaign rally in Philadelphia for his wife over criticisms that the crime bill he approved while president led to a surge in the imprisonment of black people.  The Democratic race for the Nov. 8 election has become increasingly heated as Hillary Clinton, stung by a string of losses in state contests, has traded barbs with her rival for the partys nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, over who is better prepared for the White House.  In Philadelphia, several protesters heckled the former president mid-speech and held up signs, including one that read: CLINTON Crime Bill Destroyed Our Communities. Video footage of Hillary Clinton defending the reforms in 1994 has been widely circulated during the campaign by activists in the Black Lives Matter protest movement. In the footage, she calls young people in gangs super-predators who need to be brought to heel. Hillary Clinton, 68, who also has faced protesters upset by her remarks, said in February she regretted her language. Bill Clinton, 69, who was president from 1993 to 2001, defended her 1994 remarks, which protesters say were racially insensitive, and suggested the protesters anger was misplaced.  I dont know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped on crack and sent them out on the street to murder other African-American children, he said, shaking his finger at a heckler as Clinton supporters cheered, according to video of the event. Maybe you thought they were good citizens. She (Hillary Clinton) didnt.  You are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter, he told a protester. Tell the truth. Hillary Clinton promised to end mass incarceration in the first major speech of her campaign last year. She has won the support of the majority of black voters in every state nominating contest so far, often by a landslide. Spokesmen for the campaign and Bill Clinton did not immediately respond on Thursday to a request for comment. The United States has more people in prison than any other country. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1.05 million prisoners were held in federal or state facilities in 1994. By 2014, it was 1.56 million. That year, 6 percent of all black men in their 30s were in prison, a rate six times higher than that of white men of the same age. Bill Clinton said last year that he regretted signing the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act into law because it contributed to the high incarceration rate of black people for nonviolent crimes. On Thursday, he did not explicitly recant those regrets, but appeared to be angry at any suggestion the bill was wholly bad. The legislation imposed tougher sentences, put thousands more police on the streets and helped fund the building of extra prisons. It was known for its federal three strikes provision that sent violent offenders to prison for life. The bill was backed by congressional Republicans and hailed at the time as a success for Clinton. Although Clinton is popular among Democrats who view him as a gifted orator and crowd pleaser, he has in the past veered from the carefully calibrated message put out by his wifes campaign, causing problems for her representatives. During Hillary Clintons failed 2008 presidential bid, civil rights leaders and high-ranking Democrats in Congress criticized the former president for statements he made during a heated campaign against then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama. Bill Clinton said Obamas campaign had played the race card. Obama became the first U.S. black president in November that year. Bill Clintons remarks on Thursday drew criticism online. Some saw him as dismissive of the Black Lives Matter movement, a national outgrowth of anger over a string of encounters in which police officers killed unarmed black people. Johnetta Elzie, a civil rights activist, wrote online that Clinton cant handle being confronted by his own record. This is like watching a robot malfunction, she wrote. Earlier in Philadelphia, Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, assailed Clinton as unqualified to be president as the two campaigns became increasingly testy less than two weeks before New Yorks nominating contest. Are you qualified to be president of the United States when youre raising millions of dollars from Wall Street, an entity whose greed, recklessness and illegal behavior helped destroy our economy? Sanders said at a news conference. Clinton this week sharply questioned Sanders credentials and ability to carry out a campaign pledge to break up the big banks. Spokesmen for Clinton noted she never said the word unqualified when she questioned his preparedness for the presidency, but they declined to say whether she believed in that characterization. Clinton aimed for a more magnanimous tone than her aides when speaking to reporters during a subway ride in New York City. I dont know why hes saying that, she said of Sanders calling her unqualified. But I will take Bernie Sanders over Ted Cruz or Donald Trump any time, she said of the two leading candidates for the Republican presidential nomination. Sanders returned the sentiment in an interview with the CBS Evening News later on Thursday. I think the idea of a Donald Trump or a Ted Cruz presidency would be an unmitigated disaster for this country. I will do everything in my power and work as hard as I can to make sure that that does not happen, and if Secretary Clinton is the nominee, I will certainly support her, he said.

"Democrat Sanders, 'big fan of pope,' to attend Vatican conference","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders announced on Friday he had accepted an invitation to the Vatican, saying his views on fighting income equality were similar to those of Pope Francis. I am a big, big fan of the pope, Sanders said in an interview on MSNBC. Hes trying to inject this sense of morality into how we do economics ... and we need that absolutely desperately. The Sanders campaign said in a statement that he would attend a conference on social, economic and environmental issues during the April 15 visit. Sanders, who has made fighting poverty a central issue of his campaign, said he would talk about how to create a moral economy during his visit. The visit will come four days before the primary election in delegate-rich New York, a state that both Sanders and his rival Democrat Hillary Clinton are viewing as home turf and hoping to win. The announcement of Sanders trip came as the pope called for a church that was less strict and more compassionate toward imperfect Catholics. Sanders said he admires the pope for talking about the worship of money, the greed thats out there. There are people who think that Bernie Sanders is radical, Sanders said on MSNBC. Read what the pope is writing. ",politicsNews,"April 8, 2016 ",1
Trump adviser says Republicans won't have contested convention ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps new top political strategist predicted on Friday the Republican presidential front-runner would amass the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch his partys nomination well before the Republican National Convention in July. Veteran campaign tactician Paul Manafort was chosen by Trump on Thursday to oversee a fractious nomination process that many Republicans expect may not yield a clear winner before the convention. Manafort said on CNNs New Day program that rival Ted Cruz, the U.S. senator from Texas, will not be able to dent Trumps delegate lead before Californias June 7 primary. The reality is: Ted Cruz has seen his best day, Manafort said. The reality is: this convention process will be over with sometime in June, probably June 7, and itll be apparent to the world that Trump is over that 1,237 number. Trump has been uncharacteristically quiet on social media after his double-digit loss to Cruz in the Wisconsin primary on Tuesday, which followed a series of missteps on the campaign trail including his statement, later recanted, advocating punishment for women who have illegal abortions. In elevating Manafort, Trump said he would add more staff before the convention in an expansion of his campaign team beyond the close-knit group of advisers who have been at his side since he jumped into the presidential race last June. People that I know that want to get involved and wanted to before but didnt have a way in, Manafort said.  The next presidential nominating contests before the Nov. 8 election include a number in East Coast states seen as more fertile ground for the real estate tycoon, including in his native New York on April 19. Manafort cited Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland as states where Trump would do well. By the time we get to California the momentum is going be very clear and Ted Cruz path to victory is going to be in shambles, he said. Cruz, appearing on the CNN program earlier, said he had a clear path to 1,237 delegates. Its difficult. Weve got to win and weve got to win consistently, Cruz said. Hes right. He has to win, Manafort said. ",politicsNews,"April 8, 2016 ",1
U.S. leaders must still 'distrust' Iran: Clinton,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said in a speech to a pro-Israel lobby group in Washington on Monday Iran still posed a threat to Israel and needed to be closely watched. Speaking to the annual policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, also criticized her Republican rival Donald Trump for having a neutral stance on Israel.  She said U.S. leaders needed to show loyalty to its Mideast ally and anyone who doesnt understand that has no business being our president. ",politicsNews,"March 21, 2016 ",1
"In record year for political ads, media buyers see tight market ","(Reuters) - Media buyers expect record political ad spending driven by the U.S. presidential race will create a tight market for advertisers and drive up rates. Super PACs, which rose to prominence after a landmark U.S. Supreme Court campaign finance decision in 2010, are preparing to buy national ads and to spend more once the nominees for each party are chosen at the political conventions in July, media buyers who work with these groups told Reuters. The campaigns are more sophisticated and are raising more money than ever before, said Kyle Roberts, president and chief executive of Smart Media Group, an Alexandria, VA-based media buyer that works with Republican candidates. It is much easier today for outside groups to raise money to influence national elections.  The bulk of political ad spending typically is in local markets. But networks are already seeing more national ad buys by the Super PACs, a shift that could benefit television networks. The election also has brought a ratings boon to television, which had been losing audience to Internet streaming. Fox News Channel said Wednesday it was No. 1 among basic cable networks last quarter for the first time.. CNN had the best quarter in seven years.  We have seen a little bit of the Super PAC money come in, said Katrina Cukaj executive vice president of portfolio sales and client partnerships at Turner ad sales, part of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), which owns CNN.We havent seen the full force of it yet. That will come when we know who the candidates are.  The frenzy in political ad spending is expected to reshape  advertiser behavior. Media buyers predict the presidential election will result in an increase in spending at this years so-called upfronts, where the networks present their fall line-ups and woo big advertisers with swanky parties and celebrity appearances. Upfronts run through May. The Super PACs are not afraid to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in just a few local stations, so it wouldnt surprise me if the national election is going to have a real impact on the upfronts, said Barry Lowenthal, president of The Media Kitchen, a New York-based media buyer. Lowenthal expects pricing for advertising to go up as a result of the Super PAC spending.  More advertisers are expected to lock in ad spots for the fourth quarter, rather than face price increases later or risk getting shut out of the market. Media buyers say they expect up to a 5 percent increase in spending for this years upfronts  the first increase in two years. That could mean a jump in spending of up to $8.9 billion for prime time spots alone, based on data from Media Dynamics. Presidential ad spending for cable and broadcast television and radio in 2016 has already surpassed the $300 million mark, up more than 200 percent from the same period in the 2012 election cycle, according to data from Smart Media Group.  This is going to be a very good year for us, said CBS Chair and CEO Les Moonves at an investment conference in February. Its a terrible thing to say, but bring it on Donald. Keep going, Moonves said, referring to the Republican GOP frontrunner, Donald Trump. ",politicsNews,"April 1, 2016 ",1
"Obama, Republicans urge Trump to soften tone","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump is facing bipartisan pressure to adopt a more presidential tone in his White House run including from Democratic President Barack Obama and Republicans who worry his missteps may do irreparable harm to the party and his campaign.  The Republican front-runner came under fire from Obama on Friday over Trumps recent comments that he would not rule out using nuclear weapons in Europe and that Japan and South Korea might need nuclear weapons to ease the U.S. financial commitment to their security.  The person who made the statements doesnt know much about foreign policy or nuclear policy or the Korean peninsula, or the world generally, Obama told a news conference at the conclusion of a nuclear security summit in Washington. Ive said before that people pay attention to American elections. What we do is really important to the rest of the world, he said. Trump lost ground on the online prediction market after drawing fire for his suggestion earlier in the week, which he later dialed back, that women be punished for getting abortions if the procedure is banned. Those who marveled at Trumps rise are now warning the New York billionaire that his shoot-from-the-lip approach to campaigning could jeopardize his chance to win the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election. Tuesday could be a turning point when Wisconsin hosts its nominating contest. Trump, 69, trails his leading rival, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, 45, of Texas in the Upper Midwestern state. A Cruz win would make it harder for Trump to reach the magic number of 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination before the Republican national convention in July. The winner will get to claim all of Wisconsins 42 delegates. If he continues to fumble the ball, he risks everything, said David Bossie, who as president of the conservative group Citizens United has helped to introduce Trump to grassroots activists. These types of ham-handed mistakes give his opponents even greater opportunity. But losing the Republican nomination may not keep Trump out of the November election. In excerpts of an interview on Fox News Sunday to be aired this Sunday, Trump said he wanted to run as a Republican but declined to rule out a third-party candidacy. Asked what he would do if he didnt get the Republican nomination, Trump replied: Were going to have to see how I was treated. A businessman and former reality TV show host, Trump has never held public office but hails his mastery of negotiating business deals as the sort of experience a U.S. president needs to be successful at home and abroad. He sent ripples through the Republican Party, which promotes a muscular foreign policy, by declaring NATO obsolete and for asserting that as president he might loosen the ties with  longstanding U.S. allies.   Trump made a surprise visit on Thursday to the Republican National Committee in Washington where he said he and Chairman Reince Priebus discussed how to unify the party going into the July convention. Priebus also addressed any confusion Trump may have had about delegate allocation rules that will govern the proceedings, a source familiar with the meeting told Reuters. Should Trump fail to win enough delegates to secure the nomination outright in the state-by-state contests ending in June, party delegates will select a nominee at the convention in a complex process of sequential votes. Online predictions market PredictIt said on Friday that the probability Trump will win his partys nomination has dropped sharply in the past week while the likelihood of a contested convention to choose another candidate has risen. Those Republicans who see in Trump a chance to generate voter turnout beyond party regulars to blue-collar Democrats and win the White House say his detail-free style of campaigning has come back to haunt him and he needs to gear up for a new phase. Trump needs to be less sensitive about attacks from opponents and let some go by without responding, said retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, a former Republican presidential candidate who dropped out of the race earlier this year and has since endorsed Trump. If he can just get beyond that and learn how to bite his tongue and redirect people to something that is important, it will show a level of statesmanship, Carson said. During the Wisconsin campaign, Trump has relentlessly attacked the states governor, Scott Walker, another Republican who dropped out of the presidential race last year and who has endorsed Cruz. Former U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has offered Trump informal advice, said Trump should replicate the type of performance he gave at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on March 21, when he spoke from a teleprompter and offered a well-thought-out case for strong U.S.-Israeli relations. Gingrich said Trump should make eight to 10 policy speeches in order to give voters a sense of stability and seriousness. Hes gone from being an insurgent that people laughed at and a front-runner that people were amazed by to the potential nominee. That requires you to change your role as all this comes together, Gingrich said. Alternatively, Trump could start to listen to what he says is his wife Melanias longtime admonishment: Darling, be more presidential.  Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders will compete in Wisconsin on Tuesday on the Democratic Party side. Both have hop-scotched between Wisconsin and New York, which holds its primary on April 19.  Clinton, a former U.S. senator from New York with national campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, is trying to prevent the Brooklyn-born Sanders, who represents Vermont in the Senate, from eroding support on her home turf. Both candidates will attend a state party fundraising dinner in Wisconsin on Saturday. ",politicsNews,"April 1, 2016 ",1
Ted Cruz hit with 'New York values'; Trump gets Giuliani backing,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is getting a taste of the New York values he derided in Iowa as Republicans turn to the next big U.S. presidential contest in the home state of front-runner Donald Trump. The New York billionaire lost the Wisconsin Republican primary on Tuesday to Cruz and is seeking to rebound in New York on April 19. He won the backing on Thursday of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was irked by Cruzs values comments. Its New York City. Were family. I can make fun of New York but you cant, Giuliani, who led the city through the trauma of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, told the New York Post. I support Trump. Im gonna vote for Trump, he said. Ohio Governor John Kasich, running third in the Republican race, chimed in with an ad called Values, part of a seven-figure ad buy in New York and Pennsylvania, which votes on April 26. New Yorkers arent stupid and they certainly wont fall for Ted Cruzs lame soliloquies and flattery after he slammed their values, said Kasich spokeswoman Connie Wehrkamp. Trump canceled a Friday trip to California to focus on New York. He turned on Cruz Wednesday night during his first rally in the state since the double-digit loss in Wisconsin. Ive got this guy standing over there, looking at me, talking about New York values with scorn in his face, with hated, with hatred of New York, Trump said, drawing a chorus of boos. Cruz credited his Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses victory in part to  his attacks on Trumps New York values. He told ABC on Thursday the phrase referred to the states liberal Democrats. Cruz took another hit in the Bronx, where a group of high school students protesting his stance on immigration threatened a walkout if their principal did not cancel his appearance. Most of us are immigrants or come from immigrant backgrounds. Ted Cruz goes against everything our school stands for, Destiny Domeneck, 16, told the New York Daily News.

Bill Clinton defends wife's 'super predator' comment to protesters,"(Reuters) - Bill Clinton faced down protesters for 10 minutes at a presidential campaign rally in Philadelphia for his wife, Hillary Clinton, over their criticisms that a 1994 crime bill he approved while president led to a surge in black people being imprisoned. Several protesters heckled him and held signs, including one that read CLINTON Crime Bill Destroyed Our Communities. Video footage of Hillary Clinton defending the bill in 1994 by calling young people in gangs super predators who need to be brought to heel have been widely circulated during the campaign by activists in the Black Lives Matter protest movement. Bill Clinton defended her 1994 remarks, which protesters say were racially insensitive.  I dont know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped on crack and sent them out on the street to murder other African-American children, he said, shaking his finger at a heckler as Clinton supporters cheered, according to video of the event. Maybe you thought they were good citizens. She didnt.  Hillary Clinton, who also has faced protesters upset by her remarks, has said she regrets using the term.  Bill Clinton said last year that he regrets signing the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act into law because it contributed to the countrys high incarceration rate of black people for nonviolent crimes.

Obama defends choice of white male jurist for Supreme Court,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Thursday defended his pick of a white man to fill a U.S. Supreme Court vacancy against criticism he could have chosen someone from a more diverse background, saying Merrick Garland was indisputably qualified for the post. Obama was speaking at a town hall-style event at the University of Chicago Law School, where he once taught, as part of a White House campaign to pressure the Republican-led Senate to approve Garland, a centrist appellate court judge. Responding to a question from a student about what kind of diversity Garland brought to the job, Obama joked that he came from Skokie, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. At no point did I say: Oh, I need a black lesbian from Skokie in that slot ... can you find me one? Thats just not how Ive approached it, Obama said, noting he had transformed the federal court with diverse picks. Yeah, hes a white guy, but hes a really outstanding jurist. Sorry, Obama said of Garland, 63, calling him indisputably qualified to serve on the highest court in the land.  Obamas first two Supreme Court picks were women, including Sonia Sotomayor, the courts first Hispanic justice. Some groups had hoped Obama would this time nominate appeals court judge Sri Srinivasan to be the courts first Indian-American member. Garland faces an uphill fight being confirmed in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has insisted the next president, who will take office on Jan. 20 after the Nov. 8 election, should fill the vacancy created by the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Before the event, McConnell dismissed Obamas Chicago event as political theater. Im sure hell gloss over the fact that the decision about filling this pivotal seat could impact our country for decades, that it could dramatically affect our most cherished constitutional rights like those contained in the First and Second Amendments, McConnell said in a Senate floor speech, referring to gun rights and freedom of speech and religion. The high court is now split 4-4 between conservatives and liberals. Garland, if confirmed, could tilt the court to the left for the first time in decades. Obama told the law school audience that the partisan fight over the nomination threatened to erode the institutional integrity of the courts. We are going to see the kinds of sharp partisan polarization that have come to characterize our electoral politics seeping entirely into the judicial system, and the courts will be just an extension of our legislatures and our elections and our politics, Obama said. At that point, people lose confidence in the ability of the courts to fairly adjudicate cases and controversies, he said.  Most Republican senators have backed McConnells stance. Only two of the 54 Republicans in the 100-seat Senate have said Garland deserves hearings and a vote. Some others have said they will meet with Garland privately for a courtesy visit. That includes Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, who is set to have breakfast with Garland next Tuesday, but only to explain why he will not consider his nomination. On Thursday, Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, announced he would have a courtesy meeting with Garland. But Grahams spokesman said the senator had not changed his opposition to holding hearings and a vote on the nomination. ",politicsNews,"April 7, 2016 ",1
"Trump, under fire on many fronts, expands campaign team","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump, under pressure to show a more presidential image, elevated a top adviser on Thursday and said he planned to hire additional staff to prepare for the possibility of a long fight for the Republican nomination. The developments came as Trump tries to rebound from a loss in Wisconsin on Tuesday to U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a defeat that punctured the billionaire businessmans aura of inevitability and made it more likely the nominee will be picked in a floor fight at the Republican National Convention in July.  The Republican front-runners stumble in Wisconsin exposed a variety of weaknesses. Trump alienated many female Republican voters by saying that women who have an abortion if the procedure were banned should be punished, a position he later backtracked on.  He also appeared to have been outmaneuvered in the scramble for delegates in Louisiana. Although Trump beat Cruz in that state on March 5, Cruz may end up with more delegates from Louisiana than Trump. Trump announced that he has assigned all functions related to the nomination process to veteran political operative Paul Manafort, who was hired to manage the process of corralling delegates who will pick the nominee. The nomination process has reached a point that requires someone familiar with the complexities involved in the final stages, Trump said. Trump also canceled plans for a campaign swing through California in coming days in order to concentrate on New York, which has suddenly emerged as a must-win state for him on April 19. He has a big lead in his home state. A Trump campaign statement said that he will add to his team as the Republican National Convention nears and that he would announce new hires in the weeks ahead.  The expansion of Trumps campaign means his team will grow beyond the close-knit group of advisers who have been at his side since he jumped into the presidential race last June. Trump said he plans to open a Washington office next week. While there has been speculation that Trump might make Manafort his campaign manager, the candidates statement made clear that current campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and deputy manager Michael Glassner would remain in their positions. Lewandowski has been charged with simple battery for grabbing a reporter who tried to ask Trump a question in Florida a month ago. Trump, famously loyal to people he trusts, has rejected calls that he fire Lewandowski. ",politicsNews,"April 7, 2016 ",1
Democrats force postponement of committee's vote on SEC nominees,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Thursday had to postpone its vote to confirm the two nominees to join the Securities and Exchange Commission, after four Democrats created a wall of opposition over the nominees views of corporate political spending. The resistance posed by Charles Schumer of New York, Robert Menendez of New Jersey, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, led to procedural confusion and the Republican Committee Chairman, Richard Shelby of Alabama, decided to delay the vote.  The SEC, the countrys top securities regulator, has faced mounting pressure to require corporations to disclose political donations since the Supreme Court struck down strict limits on campaign finance in its 2010 Citizens United decision. During a confirmation hearing on the nominees last month, Schumer had demanded the two nominees, Republican Hester Peirce and Democrat Lisa Fairfax, state in writing that they support requiring corporations to make their political donations public. At Thursdays vote, he said the answers he received were gobbledy gook that did not express firm positions, and he would oppose the nominations.  Right now, the SEC is our best hope to undo some of the damage from Citizens United and stop the torrential downpour of dark money into our elections, Schumer said after the hearing. The SEC needs commissioners who believe in and support campaign spending transparency, and unfortunately these nominees have yet to answer that call. Budget legislation passed by the Republican-majority Congress at the end of 2015 blocked the SEC from creating a rule on political spending. At Marchs confirmation hearing Peirce, a senior fellow at George Mason University, said the SEC is charged with carrying out laws and she would not undermine the budget legislation if confirmed. Peirce and Fairfax, a law professor at George Washington University, were nominated by President Barack Obama in October. At the hearings the most powerful Democrat on the committee, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, pressed to confirm the nominees quickly and send their names to the full Senate to approve. These people have been asked to take on important jobs. It is incumbent upon us to act on them promptly today and then on the floor, Brown said. Thursdays vote was en banc, which meant the committee was set to approve a single list of nominations that included the two. Voting was also postponed, then, for the other nominees on the list.

Vanguard CEO 'encouraged' by efforts to revise retirement advice rule,"(Reuters) - Vanguard Group Chief Executive Bill McNabb said on Thursday he was encouraged by the U.S. Department of Labors steps to make new rules on the advice brokers provide on retirement savings more workable. We are encouraged that the DOL has taken important steps to establish meaningful protections for retirement investors while making the final rule more workable, McNabb said in a statement posted online. The Obama administration on Wednesday unveiled its final version of a retirement advice rule aimed at ensuring that broker-dealers put their clients interests ahead of their own profits, though it was softened in response to industry complaints. Vanguard, a major manager of retirement investments that oversees more than $3 trillion in assets, had criticized an earlier version of the proposal as being applied too broadly to its activities and to situations in which investors would not reasonably expect that they were receiving investment advice. Yet Vanguard said the new rule makes disclosure and contract requirements more practical and easier to follow. All of the effort within the industry to improve the DOL proposal appears to have produced positive results, according to John Schadl, a member of the companys legal department, according to a statement also posted online. The company praised the governments efforts to align its rules better with existing standards laid out by other regulatory bodies, although Vanguard said the DOL could have done more to harmonize these standards. The Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based company said it has not fully reviewed the 1,023 pages of rules the department released. It is almost certain that we will find provisions of the new rule that will adversely affect some within the industry, Schadl said in the statement. ",politicsNews,"April 7, 2016 ",1
South Carolina bill aims to limit transgender access to bathrooms,"(Reuters) - South Carolina lawmakers have introduced a measure that would require transgender people to use public bathrooms matching their sex at birth, disregarding a growing outcry for a repeal of a similar provision enacted last month in North Carolina. Legislation such as the bill proposed in the Republican-controlled state Senate on Wednesday has fueled a national debate, with states entrenched on either side of the issue and major companies calling for a rollback on measures restricting transgender rights. The South Carolina measure would prohibit local governments from requiring private businesses to provide restroom access based on gender identity rather than birth gender. Men should use the mens room, and women should use the womens room - thats just common sense, Republican Senator Lee Bright, a sponsor of the bill, told The State newspaper. North Carolina is getting so much flak over what is common sense. The South Carolina measure is narrower than North Carolinas law, which precludes local governments from adopting anti-discrimination ordinances with protections based on gender identity and sexual orientation. But opponents warned the new proposal could spark the economic backlash seen this week in North Carolina, where   PayPal Holdings Inc cited the discriminatory nature of the law in canceling a new operations center that was to employ 400 workers in Charlotte. More than 130 business leaders, including the chief executives of Bank of America, Herbalife and American Airlines, have signed a letter with the Human Rights Campaign calling for a repeal. Government simply has no place in our bathrooms, said Jeff Ayers, executive director of South Carolina Equality, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil rights group. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed two executive orders on Thursday aimed at safeguarding the rights of transgender people. One of them bans the state from discriminating against any employee or job applicant based on a host of criteria including gender expression or identity.  This is the right thing to do. ... This is also the smart thing to do, Wolf said, citing PayPals decision in North Carolina.  Last year, the Democratic governor named a transgender woman as the states physician general, a Cabinet-level post.   More than a dozen states have considered bathroom provisions this year that would restrict access for transgender people, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.    The measures come amid a wave of legislation pushed by social conservatives after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage last year. Mississippis Republican governor on Tuesday signed a law allowing people with religious objections to deny wedding services to same-sex couples and permitting employers to cite religion in determining workplace policies on dress code, grooming and bathroom and locker access. In response, a number of governors and mayors have banned non-essential government travel to Mississippi or North Carolina. Last week, the governors of Georgia and Virginia vetoed religious liberty bills, which critics said discriminated against same-sex couples. ",politicsNews,"April 7, 2016 ",1
Pennsylvania bans bias against transgender people,"(Reuters) - Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed two anti-discrimination executive orders on Thursday aimed at safeguarding rights of transgender people, countering efforts by other states forcing them to use public bathrooms that match their gender at birth.

It also bans discrimination based on race, color, religious creed, ancestry, union membership, age, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, AIDS or HIV status, or disability. The second seeks to eliminate discrimination in contracting, requiring any company doing business with the state to eliminate bias in hiring and promotion. ",politicsNews,"April 7, 2016 ",1
Model who alleges Trump's agency defrauded her moving forward with case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Jamaican fashion model who alleges that Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trumps modeling agency defrauded her of $225,000 in pay is moving forward with her case, despite a federal judges decision to dismiss the lawsuit. U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in New York dismissed the lawsuit on March 23, saying there was insufficient evidence that model Alexia Palmer had been misled or was owed back pay. On Wednesday, Palmers lawyer, Naresh Gehi, said, We are now going to pursue our rights before the Department of Labor, and, if necessary, we will then appeal this case to the New York state Supreme Court. Palmer accused Trump Model Management LLC of lying to the federal government in its work-visa application that she would be paid a $75,000-a-year salary while living in the United States, court documents show. Instead, Palmer earned just $3,380 during the three years she was under contract with the agency after it took an 80 percent cut of her wages by deducting charges for everything from postage to walking lessons to mobile phone costs, as well as $4,000 in administrative fees, court papers show. Trumps lawyers have blasted the case as frivolous and without merit. The salary that was posited was aspirational in nature, said Trumps lawyer for immigration issues, Michael Wildes. Trump Model has been in full compliance, and should fare well in any investigation or audit. Though Trump is not personally named in the lawsuit, his presidential campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said in a statement last month that Trump Model Managements treatment of Palmer was in line with standard practice in the modeling industry. Trump has won Republican front-runner status in the 2016 election in large part by positioning himself as a champion of the American worker, vowing to protect U.S. jobs and bring back positions that companies have moved overseas to take advantage of cheaper foreign labor.  The controversial H-1B visa program for foreign workers became an issue at a presidential debate in Miami last month, where Trump called H-1B visas very, very bad for workers.

Senator Markey wants government informed of aviation cyber attacks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. senator on Thursday introduced legislation calling for airlines and aircraft manufacturers to disclose cyber security incidents to federal authorities, saying the aviation system lacks sufficient standards and oversight.  The measure, introduced by Democratic Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts, would also require the Federal Aviation Administration and other federal agencies to identify cyber  vulnerabilities within the aviation system and establish standards for addressing them. The measure also calls for a study on potential vulnerabilities posed the use of consumer wireless devices aboard flights.    Cyber security has emerged as a major issue for commercial airliners and other aircraft as the U.S. aviation system evolves to technology based on wireless and internet connectivity. The industry has stepped up efforts to forge a coordinated response. But companies are not required to report attempted or successful attacks in the United States.  While introducing the measure, Markey said his own informal survey of airlines and aircraft manufacturers showed that no successful cyber attack against aircraft has been confirmed. But he said hacking attempts are common and efforts to thwart them can be inconsistent and poorly overseen.      The senator presented his legislation as an amendment to an FAA bill that the Senate is expected to vote on later this month. The measure was quickly endorsed by the Association of Flight Attendants labor union. But it was not clear whether lawmakers would accept the measure as part of the FAA bill.

White House: Congress would have most impact on fighting tax avoidance,"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - The White House said on Thursday that the best way for the government to fight tax avoidance would be for Congress to take action after the U.S. Treasury Department issued major new rules on tax inversions on Monday. I know that if they are working on any future actions the most impactful thing we could do is if Congress took some action here, White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters when asked if the Treasury Department would issue more regulations on tax avoidance.  U.S. drug maker Pfizer Inc agreed on Tuesday to terminate its $160 billion agreement to acquire Allergan Plc in a victory for the Obama administrations push to stop tax-dodging mergers.

Senators ask Treasury to probe U.S. links to 'Panama Papers' firm,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown on Thursday urged the U.S. Treasury to investigate whether any U.S. or U.S.-linked entity was involved with the law firm at the heart of the Panama Papers leak on offshore wealth.  As the primary agency charged with protecting the integrity of the U.S. financial system and enforcing our laws against money laundering and terrorist financing, we strongly urge the Treasury Department to conduct its own inquiry into Mossack Fonsecas activities and its clients, the senators, both Democrats, wrote in a letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.

Planned Parenthood sues Indiana for abortion law,"(Reuters) - Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky on Thursday filed a lawsuit against the state of Indiana, saying a new state law restricting abortion was unconstitutional. The law, which was signed last month by Indiana Governor Mike Pence and goes into effect on July 1, prohibits abortion in the early stages of a pregnancy based on genetic abnormalities and mandates a fetus be buried or cremated, according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court. Planned Parenthood asked for an injunction on the law, according to the lawsuit, which was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the nonprofit organizations  Indiana chapter. The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed that a woman, not the state, is to determine whether or not to obtain an abortion, Ken Falk, legal director for ACLU of Indiana, said in a statement. The state of Indianas attempt to invade a womans privacy and to control her decision in this regard is unprecedented and unconstitutional. The lawsuit named the Indiana State Department of Health, prosecutors of several counties and the state medical licensing board.  A spokeswoman for the health department referred all questions to the attorney generals office, where no one could be reached for comment. A spokesman for the medical licensing board declined to comment about the lawsuit. Pences press secretary, Kara Brooks, said the governor is confident the law is constitutional. We will work with the attorney general to defend the law that enhances information expectant mothers receive and enhances protection for the unborn, she said. Indiana was the second U.S. state to prohibit abortions based on a prenatal diagnosis of disabilities such as Down syndrome, following North Dakota.  Planned Parenthood does not ask patients to disclose why they are obtaining an abortion, but under the new law, doctors would be mandated to report if a fetal anomaly was present before the abortion.  The new Indiana law would put physicians at risk for legal woes, and require additional costs for a fetus to be buried or cremated, according to the lawsuit. Gov. Mike Pence isnt a woman and he isnt a doctor. He needs to get out and stay out of our doctors offices, Betty Cockrum, chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, said in a statement.  ",politicsNews,"April 7, 2016 ",1
"Senator Lindsey Graham wants billions in emergency funds for Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Lindsey Graham said on Thursday he would seek an emergency appropriation of multiple billions of dollars to help Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon as they try to cope with the fallout from the war with Islamic State. Graham, who recently returned from a trip to the region, said the three countries are facing severe stresses as a result of the political and refugee crisis caused by the Syrian civil war and the overrun of parts of Syria and Iraq by Islamic State. One thing Im going to talk... about is an emergency appropriation that would help Egypt, Jordan and probably Lebanon to deal with the stresses theyre facing, said Graham, chairman of the Senate appropriations subcommittee overseeing foreign aid. He said he also wanted money for Israel to help protect its borders, especially with Syria.  Graham said he expected opposition from budget hawks, mostly his fellow Republicans. He said he expected Democratic support, although he acknowledged deep concern from some, including Senator Patrick Leahy, the partys leader on his subcommittee, about Egypts human rights record. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ousted former  President Mohamed Mursi in 2013 after mass protests against Mursis rule. Sisi then launched a crackdown on dissent, drawing allegations from rights groups of abuse, which his government denies. Sisi initially gained the support of millions of Egyptians, who saw him as a decisive figure who could deliver stability. But that support has thinned as the public has grown frustrated with unemployment and high prices. Graham said Egypt is too crucial an ally, to both the United States and Israel, not to bolster Sisis government militarily to fight terrorism, and economically, if he improves on human rights. A member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Graham said he would ask the Pentagon to approve Egypts requests for additional military equipment. If al-Sisi did something that would be seen by me and others as a real serious move on the rights front, it makes it easier for a guy like me to help, he said. Longer term, Graham said he wanted a Marshall Plan for the region, similar to what Washington provided to Europe after World War Two. We need to think broadly as a nation about some kind of Marshall Plan for front-line states that would allow Egypt to have access to low-interest loans, preferential trade agreements and bolstering their civil society, he said.

"Senator Graham open to selling Boeing F-18 to Kuwait, Qatar","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the Republican partys senior foreign policy voices, said on Thursday he would likely support the sale of advanced military equipment including Boeing F-18 fighter jets to Qatar and Kuwait, despite Israels concerns. Israels government worries that equipment sent to Gulf states could fall into the wrong hands and eventually be used against the Jewish state. The Israeli argument is that youve seen regimes in the neighborhood change pretty quickly. Be careful of introducing new weapons into the region, Graham told reporters following a trip to the region, citing the situation in Iraq. However, he said he thought it was important for such sales to go ahead despite those concerns, given instability in the region and threats including Islamic State militants. I say to my Israeli friends, We need partners. Partners without capability are paper partners. ... So Ill probably be in the camp of pushing the increased capability of Gulf Arab states, understanding Israelis concern, Graham said. He acknowledged that there was strong opposition in Congress toward arming some Gulf Arab states. I dont know how the votes go right now, Graham said. Graham is a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees foreign aid. ",politicsNews,"April 7, 2016 ",1
Exclusive: Cruz about even with Trump in Republican presidential race - poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Ted Cruzs support among Republicans is about even at a national level with party front-runner Donald Trump, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, as the U.S. senator picked up a victory in Wisconsins primary. Cruzs gains in the polling mark the first time since November that one of Trumps rivals has threatened his lead in support among Republicans in the race to be party nominee for the Nov. 8 election. The gains coincided with a bumpy patch for Trump, who was forced to backtrack last week after saying women who had abortions should face punishment if the procedure is outlawed, and who voiced support for his campaign manager after he was charged with misdemeanor assault for allegedly grabbing a reporter.  Cruz, a senator from Texas, got 35.2 percent of support to Trumps 39.5 percent, the poll of 568 Republicans taken April 1-5 found. The numbers put the two within the polls 4.8 percentage-point credibility interval, a measure of accuracy.  Cruz and Trump were also briefly about even early last week. But as recently as a month ago, when Senator Marco Rubio was also still a candidate, Cruz trailed Trump in the Reuters/Ipsos polling by about 20 points. Ohio Governor John Kasich, the only other candidate left in  the race for the Republican Party nomination, placed third in the April 1-5 poll with 18.7 percent. Trumps support has faltered among women in particular in recent weeks. More than 70 percent of likely women voters said they had an unfavorable opinion of Trump, according to the rolling poll average for the five-day period ended April 5. In the Democratic race, front-runner Hillary Clinton held a nationwide lead in the poll of about 7 points over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Cruz and Sanders easily won their Wisconsin presidential primary contests on Tuesday night. Sanders would still face a difficult task overtaking Clinton as the nominating contest, but Cruzs double-digit win over Trump was seen as a breakthrough for Republican Party forces battling to block him.

U.S. senators vote to bolster travel security in FAA bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted on Thursday to bolster travel security in the wake of the Brussels attacks with measures that include doubling the number of transportation security teams with bomb-sniffing dogs at domestic airports and other transit hubs. Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to add security measures to a separate bill that calls for renewing the programs of the Federal Aviation Administration through September 2017. The FAA bill is expected to come up for a final vote later this month.    After Republicans and Democrats reached a deal on security measures earlier in the day, lawmakers voted to raise the number of Visible Intermodal Prevention Response, or VIPER, teams within the Transportation Security Administration from 31 to 60. VIPER teams, which are intended as a visible deterrent to attacks, can be deployed at airports and train or bus stations. Other measures would bolster the vetting of airport employees, add security to vulnerable check-in and baggage claim areas and authorize the TSA to donate security equipment to foreign airports with direct flights to the United States. The approved provisions would also order a new U.S. assessment of foreign cargo security programs and provide grant money to train state, local and foreign authorities in how to respond to mass-casualty and active shooter incidents. It is unclear what kind of reception the FAA bill, if passed by the Senate, might receive in the House of Representatives. House lawmakers have been considering their own FAA legislation. That bill also calls for the privatization of the U.S. air traffic control system, a measure that is not in the Senates legislation.  ",politicsNews,"April 7, 2016 ",1

Election stirs debate about Fed's handling of political pressure,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump says the Federal Reserve has stoked asset bubbles and backs a congressional review of its decisions. Bernie Sanders also wants to audit the Fed to make it less beholden to Wall Street. Ted Cruz calls for a return to a gold standard abandoned in 1933. Such voices from the 2016 presidential campaign have emboldened lawmakers who seek to limit the Feds powers and are prompting some current and former Fed officials to call for steps to placate the U.S. central banks harshest critics.  More than a dozen insiders and Fed watchers said in interviews they were concerned that the next president could be more sympathetic to critics views that the Fed has grown too powerful and impenetrable. Confronted with a possible Republican push to give Congress more say in shaping Fed policy, these insiders say concessions may be necessary to protect the Feds independence. Theres a deep-seated institutional fear that if you crack the door open, it will be kicked in. But often thats just not the case, said David Stockton, the Feds former research director and now a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.  The concerns among the group, which includes current and former regional presidents, are growing despite the expectation that Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, who polls suggest should win in November, would help the Fed preserve the status-quo.  The worries reflect the balancing act that central banks face as the world economy still sputters despite aggressive monetary easing. Central bankers are getting blamed both for overstepping their bounds and for not doing enough to bolster growth. Even as the U.S. economy outperforms, the Fed is especially vulnerable, because it is ahead of its peers in unwinding the crisis-era stimulus. Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues have warned in public speeches and private meetings with lawmakers that initiatives to make the Fed more accountable and transparent could backfire. They are defending the decades-old, but now challenged, consensus that the Fed can best safeguard long-term economic stability when shielded from direct political interference. The officials who were interviewed said the Fed could take steps to become more open, such as responding more promptly to lawmaker requests for information and revealing what rules of thumb inform decisions on rates.      The best response is not to go into a defensive shell, but instead the Fed should attempt to influence the terms of any changes that are coming, said Stockton. Some are even embracing a limited outside review of Fed  decisions - effectively a version of an audit supported by Trump, Sanders and Cruz. While proposals for the Fed to become more open in explaining what informs its decisions may get some traction, those interviewed acknowledge that the Fed leadership appears unlikely to embrace an audit or major changes to its policy playbook. The Fed declined to comment on changes suggested in the interviews. Two separate bills proposed by the Republicans in the Senate and the House call for a government watchdog to evaluate, or audit, policy decisions and to tie them to single policy rule that the Fed would adopt and make public. Yellen and her colleagues say the audit would expose the Fed to short-term political pressures, making policy less, not more predictable. The single rule policy would severely impair the Feds policymaking, Yellen has warned, while New York Fed President William Dudley has compared it to going on autopilot in the face of complex global challenges.  Concern about the Republican initiatives is particularly strong among the 12 district presidents. Freshman Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari told Reuters in a February interview that the Feds credibility suffered during the recent economic crisis. The central bank needs to abandon its Wizard of Oz routine where it tells Americans we are so mysterious, so smart, you cant understand what we are doing, he said. Narayana Kocherlakota, his predecessor, told Reuters that while he did not think Fed policy lacked public oversight, the central bank should address such concerns and offer its own solutions. Optics matter, he said. Simply to continue to say that were really transparent and there is no reason for us to change how were doing things - I dont think thats going to work. Shortcomings of the current approach of reiterating the Feds criticism of the proposed changes were in plain view at Yellens latest congressional testimony on Feb. 10.  In its run-up, Yellen held 10 private discussions with lawmakers in January alone, including a call with Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee and backs the rule-based policy bill.  That however did not stop Hensarling from putting Yellen on the spot, presenting a letter from prominent economists, including three Nobel Laureates and several former Fed officials who backed his bill, and labeling Yellens warnings as apocalyptic and hyperbolic. Yellen was also taken to task by some Democrats over the Feds planned rate hikes that they said would disproportionately hurt minorities, and over what they saw as too cozy ties with Wall Street.  Kocherlakota, now a professor at University of Rochester, said a scheduled audit, preferably once every two years, was a very manageable way to deal with the criticism and avoid ad-hoc political meddling. In a similar vein, Andrew Levin, a former advisor to Yellen, suggested the Fed could meet halfway the supporters of rule-based policy by disclosing benchmarks it uses in its debates. Its really hard to understand why the Fed wont use these benchmarks to help explain what theyre doing, said Levin, now a Dartmouth College professor, citing as an example the Taylor Rule in which rates are tied to levels of inflation and growth. By sharing information more readily, the Fed could also possibly improve relations with Republicans, some current and former Fed officials said. That relationship has been strained by a drawn-out probe into an alleged 2012 leak of sensitive policy details to advisory firm Medley Global Advisors. Republican lawmakers have requested transcripts and other information related to the case, but the Fed has said it is limited in how much it could disclose because of an ongoing Justice Department investigation.  Others say the central bank should be open to review its regional structure dating back to 1913, and how regional presidents are selected. Today they get picked by district Fed directors appointed by local bank groups and the Fed governors in Washington, with little public disclosure.      The Fed and the Congress have a long history of friction. A Brookings Institution paper published last week analyzed 879 bills proposed since 1947 and found politicians usually try to redefine the Feds powers when the economy falters, noting a spike in such efforts since the 2008 global financial crisis. The latest major changes came in 1977 when lawmakers clarified the Feds dual price stability and employment mandate and in 2010, when the Dodd-Frank act gave the Fed greater supervisory powers while setting limits on future emergency lending and its autonomy to conduct it.      The approaching November elections compound uncertainty for the Fed, Sarah Binder and Mark Spindel wrote in the paper. We doubt the path forward will be easy for even the best intentioned and expert of central bankers. ",politicsNews,"April 7, 2016 ",1
Factbox: Fed and presidential campaign: where candidates stand ,"(Reuters) - Three of the five candidates running for U.S. president - Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders - have said they supported initiatives that would subject the Federal Reserves policymaking to greater scrutiny or change its policy framework.[L3N16W46S] Here are details of the candidates views and the two proposed bills:  * DONALD TRUMP, the Republican front-runner, tweeted in February, It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve - a reference to an Audit the Fed Senate bill that the central bank fiercely opposes. He has said the Fed played a role in stoking asset bubbles and predicted a very massive recession. A spokeswoman declined to elaborate on Trumps views on Fed independence. Last year, before the Fed raised rates in December, Trump accused the central bank of keeping rates low at the bidding of President Barack Obama, something the White House has denied. Janet Yellen is highly political and shes not raising rates for a very specific reason: because Obama told her not, Trump told a news conference in November. He doesnt want to see a big bubble burst during his administration. * TED CRUZ, the No. 2 Republican candidate, supports Fed audits and a commission to consider a monetary rule tied to gold rather than discretion, according to spokeswoman Catherine Frazier. The United States dropped the gold standard in 1933.  In a Republican debate in October, Cruz said: I think the Fed should get out of the business of trying to juice our economy and simply be focused on sound monetary policy and monetary stability, ideally tied to gold. * BERNIE SANDERS, the No. 2 Democratic candidate who as senator backed Audit the Fed, said in an emailed statement that such an annual policy review would help make the Fed a more democratic institution that is responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans rather than the billionaires on Wall Street. He also opposes Fed payments to banks on excess reserves. In a New York Times column published in December, Sanders wrote: To rein in Wall Street, we should begin by reforming the Federal Reserve... The sad reality is that the Federal Reserve doesnt regulate Wall Street; Wall Street regulates the Fed.  Sanders also criticized the way Fed officials are selected: Banking industry executives must no longer be allowed to serve on the Feds boards and to handpick its members and staff, he wrote. Board positions should instead include representatives from all walks of life  including labor, consumers, homeowners, urban residents, farmers and small businesses. Today, bankers and heads of business, industry, unions, and community groups and organizations serve as district Fed directors. Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, and the third-place Republican Kasich have not commented publicly on Fed policy independence.  * The Federal Reserve Transparency Act, known as Audit the Fed, was introduced by Republican Senator Rand Paul early last year. It would instruct the Government Accountability Office, a non-partisan congressional watchdog agency, to review and evaluate the Feds monetary policy decisions, repealing a decades-old firewall between the GAO, which now reviews other Fed activities including bank regulation, and policy decisions on interest rates. The bill has struggled to gain Senate support and was referred to a committee. * The Fed Oversight Reform and Modernization Act (FORM), sponsored by Republican Representative Bill Huizenga, passed the House in November. Among other changes to Fed structure and bank supervision, the bill would tie policy decisions to a single directive rule. An audit could be launched or congressional testimony called if the GAO determined the Fed strayed from the rule. The bill was sent to the Senate and also referred to its banking committee. * GAO Managing Director Orice Williams told Reuters that, were either of the bills to become law, the agency would take a non-partisan approach and hire experts as needed to do the job.

California bill to fight fashion models' eating disorders advances,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - A California bill aimed at reducing eating disorders among models cleared its first legislative hurdle on Wednesday, following efforts in several countries to fight extreme thinness  in an industry that pressures models to lose weight. The measure would require the state to develop health standards for models and regard them as employees of the brands they represent. The goal of the bill is not only to protect the health of the workers themselves, but also to help young people who emulate models, said the bills author, state Assemblyman Marc Levine, a Democrat who represents the Marin County suburbs of San Francisco. Last year, France banned excessive thinness in models, partly in response to the death in 2010 of Isabelle Caro, a 28-year-old former French fashion model. She died from anorexia after posing for a photographic campaign to raise awareness about the illness. Israel enacted a similar measure in 2013, while Italy and Spain rely on voluntary codes of conduct to protect models. The California bill passed the Assembly Labor and Employment Committee on Wednesday. It must be approved by additional committees and the full legislature before it can go to Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, who has not said if he would sign it. At Wednesdays committee hearing activist Sara Ziff, a former fashion model, wept as she recounted abuses she endured as a teenage model, including pressure to strip for photographers. I felt like I was being treated more like an escort than a model, said Ziff, 32, who founded the group Model Alliance. By requiring that models be considered employees, she said, the state would protect them from sexual abuse and exploitation, and the risks of developing an eating disorder. The Association of Talent Agents has called the bill unworkable. A licensing requirement for modeling agencies is redundant because California talent agencies are already licensed, association President Karen Stuart said. This does nothing to reduce the problems that you heard about today, Stuart said. ",politicsNews,"April 7, 2016 ",1
Exclusive: White House declines to support encryption legislation - sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is declining to offer public support for draft legislation that would empower judges to require technology companies such as Apple Inc to help law enforcement crack encrypted data, sources familiar with the discussions said. The decision all but assures that the years-long political impasse over encryption will continue even in the wake of the high-profile effort by the Department of Justice to force Apple to break into an iPhone used by a gunman in last Decembers  shootings in San Bernardino, California. President Obama suggested in remarks last month that he had come around to the view that law enforcement agencies needed to have a way to gain access to encrypted information on smartphones.  But the administration remains deeply divided on the issue, the sources said.  The draft legislation from Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the Republican chair and top Democrat respectively of the Senate Intelligence Committee, is expected to be introduced as soon as this week.  The bill gives federal judges broad authority to order tech companies to help the government but does not spell out what companies might have to do or the circumstances under which they could be ordered to help, according to sources familiar with the text. It also does not create specific penalties for noncompliance. Although the White House has reviewed the text and offered feedback, it is expected to provide minimal public input, if any, the sources said.  Its stance is partly a reflection of a political calculus that any encryption bill would be controversial and is unlikely to go far in a gridlocked Congress during an election year, sources said.  A White House spokesman declined to comment on the pending legislation, but referred to White House press secretary Josh Earnests statements on encryption legislation. Last month Earnest said the administration is skeptical of lawmakers ability to resolve the encryption debate given their difficulty in tackling simple things. Tech companies and civil liberties advocates have opposed encryption legislation, arguing that mandating law enforcement access to tech products will undermine security for everyone. Several lawmakers, including U.S. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a Democrat, have vowed to oppose any attempt to limit encryption protections in U.S. technology products. Even some intelligence officials worry that enabling law enforcement agencies to override encryption will create more problems than it solves by opening the door to hackers and foreign intelligence services. Some also say it is unnecessary because the government has other means of getting the information it needs.   The Justice Department dropped its legal action against Apple last week, saying it had found a way to hack into the phone.  The White House last year backed away from pursuing legislation that would require U.S. technology firms to provide a back door to access encrypted data. The backpedaling resembled a retreat by President Bill Clintons administration in the 1990s on efforts to require a special computer chip in  phones to give the U.S. government a way to monitor encrypted conversations.      But the desire for encryption legislation among some intelligence and law enforcement officials has never gone away, and it gained new life after the Islamist militant-inspired attacks in Paris and San Bernardino.  Obama, speaking at the South by Southwest entertainment festival in Austin, Texas, last month, warned against fetishizing our phones and said that doing nothing to address law enforcements encryption challenges cant be the right answer.  Obama, however, also cautioned against Congress taking any action that would be sloppy and rushed. Apple and others have called on Congress to help find a solution to the problem of criminals and terrorists using encryption to avoid surveillance. A separate proposal to form a national encryption commission to further study the issue is also not expected to be enacted this year. Meanwhile, tech companies are stepping up their efforts to implement encryption and other security measures. The Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp announced this week that it had implemented complete encryption of its service - and now cannot get access to customer messages even if was ordered to by a court.

Puerto Rico enacts emergency debt moratorium bill,"SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Ricos governor on Wednesday signed an emergency bill allowing the government to halt payments on its debt, throwing into doubt broader restructuring plans to stave off a financial collapse of the U.S. territory. The measure, which earlier passed Puerto Ricos legislature, lets Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla declare a moratorium on any debt payment he deems necessary and could alter the structure of the Government Development Bank (GDB), the islands primary fiscal agent.  This legislation provides us with the tools to address the highest priority of needs  providing essential services to our people  without fear of retribution, Garcia Padilla said in a statement. Puerto Rico, burdened by a $70 billion debt load it says it cannot pay, a 45 percent poverty rate and shrinking population, faces economic collapse without measures that either change its laws or involve an agreement with creditors. Wednesdays emergency law was rushed into existence as the GDB faces possible default on a $422 million debt payment due on May 1. Garcia Padilla had said he would consider a debt moratorium ahead of that deadline. GDB and its creditors are trying to work out a consensual restructuring. But the new law could spark a new era of litigation from creditors, said Daniel Hanson, an analyst with Height Securities. We believe the overwhelming majority of Puerto Rican issuers have violated their creditors rights, he said in a Wednesday note. Some GDB creditors on Monday sued to prevent a run on the bank, asking a federal court to block depositors from taking out their money while talks continue. The passage of the law drew a quick rebuke from some creditors. Stephen Spencer, a financial adviser to bondholders including OppenheimerFunds and Franklin Advisers, said it might violate the terms of a prior restructuring deal at PREPA, the islands power utility. That deal, under which creditors agreed to take 15 percent repayment cuts, should be explicitly preserved, rather than being cast into a state of uncertainty, Spencer said in a statement. He said the law could close the door to anyone extending new credit to Puerto Rico, seriously impeding its ability to meet citizens needs. In a statement on Wednesday night, PREPA Executive Director Javier Quintana Mendez said the agreement remains in place and should not be negatively affected by the new law.  We continue working in collaboration with our creditors, focused on the implementation of our recovery plan, Quintana said. A second group of creditors holding debt issued by Puerto Ricos sales tax authority, COFINA, expressed support for the debt freeze bill, citing delays in legislative efforts by federal lawmakers in Washington to address Puerto Ricos crisis. With entrenched private institutions obstructing the legislative process in Washington, it is understandable that Puerto Rican leaders are taking steps to equip the island with the tools it needs, Susheel Kirpalani, counsel to the COFINA Senior Bondholders Group at law firm Quinn Emanuel, said.    A rescue bill being drafted by the U.S. House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee so far uses U.S. bankruptcy rules as guidance for a solution, something many creditors oppose. Hearings are expected next week in Washington.   Relations between Puerto Rico and its creditors are growing tenser as major debt payments in May and July loom.  On Tuesday, some of Puerto Ricos general obligation bondholders criticized the debt moratorium law, at the time still being debated by lawmakers, saying Puerto Rico was ignoring their offer to restructure debt by extending principal payments. Garcia Padilla appeared to fire back on Wednesday, saying our creditors have engaged in public relations efforts that contain falsehoods about their proposed fixes  all of which are aimed at misinforming the public and dissuading Congress from doing what is right for our 3.5 million American citizens. Puerto Ricos benchmark 2035 GO bond 74514LE86=MSRB is down sharply since talk of a debt moratorium bill surfaced earlier this week. On Wednesday the bond fell 2.45 points in price to bid 63.299, yielding 13.33 percent, according to Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board data.  Puerto Ricos problems stopped being legal problems and theyve started being a math problem... at the end of the day Puerto Rico cant pay, said Nicholas Venditti, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, speaking at a luncheon for reporters in New York.

Lawyers for ex House Speaker Hastert ask judge for probation,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Lawyers for former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, convicted last year of a financial crime in a hush-money case, urged a federal judge on Wednesday to spare him prison time for health reasons and because he is deeply sorry. Hastert, 74, faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison when sentenced later this month for his guilty plea in October to a federal charge of structuring - evading bank reporting rules by withdrawing large amounts of cash in small increments. The former Republican speaker of the House of Representatives has admitted to paying $1.7 million in cash to someone he had known for decades to buy that persons silence and compensate for past misconduct toward that individual.    Neither Hasterts lawyers nor prosecutors have revealed the misconduct at issue. But unnamed law enforcement officials have told media it was sexual in nature and involved someone Hastert knew when he was a high school teacher and coach in his hometown of Yorkville, Illinois, in the 1960s and 1970s. First and foremost, Mr. Hastert is deeply sorry and apologizes for his misconduct that occurred decades ago and the resulting harm he caused to others, his lawyers said in a memorandum seeking leniency. He regrets that he resorted to structuring the withdrawal of his money from banks in an effort to prevent the disclosure of that misconduct. Prosecutors have recommended a prison term of no more than six months in exchange for Hasterts guilty plea. The defense asked that he be sentenced to probation only, citing his deteriorating medical condition. According to Wednesdays filing, Hastert suffers from diabetes, which led to foot ulceration, and medical staff discovered an infection after he was hospitalized following a fall. Hastert has also had surgery for a spinal infection, was treated for a severe blood infection and suffered a stroke, nearly dying, his lawyers have said. He has been confined to a wheelchair, can walk only a short distance with help, and needs around-the-clock care, court documents said.  Hastert is scheduled to be sentenced on April 27, according to the Chicago Tribune. ",politicsNews,"April 7, 2016 ",1
Trump opponents buoyed after front-runner's Wisconsin loss,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trumps Republican rivals were invigorated on Wednesday by the front-runners loss in the Wisconsin primary and moved quickly to bolster efforts to block the New York billionaire from capturing the partys presidential nomination. Ted Cruzs emphatic victory in Wisconsin on Tuesday night dealt momentum to his once long-shot bid to force a contested convention in July by blocking Trump from amassing enough delegates to secure the nomination.  The U.S. senator from Texas made the case he is increasingly viewed as the main Trump alternative by Republicans who cannot bring themselves to support Trump as their nominee for the Nov. 8 election. Allies of Ohio Governor John Kasich, who is positioning himself as a mainstream candidate who could emerge from a contested convention, met in Washington to brainstorm about how they could use obscure procedural rules to their advantage when the party convenes in Cleveland. One group trying to defeat Trump, who has alarmed many Republican establishment figures with his comments on immigration, Muslims and trade, was hopeful on Wednesday of a cash infusion to fund their efforts. Our funders are committed to nominating a principled conservative that can win in November and can help Republicans up and down the ballot, said Katie Packer, who is leading the anti-Trump Our Principals PAC. They understand that this is a long slog now and they are supportive of our mission and strategy. I expect that we will have the funds necessary to execute. U.S. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, lobbyists and congressional staffers were among those who met with Kasich advisers on Wednesday to discuss what one Republican congressional staffer present admitted was the governors long-shot bid. He has won only his home state in nominating contests so far. Kasichs campaign has a plan going into the convention ... and if the convention goes to a brokered convention, they have a legitimate chance, the staffer said. The next big test in stopping Trump will be New York, the state he calls home. A Monmouth University poll of New York Republicans released on Monday showed Trump with 52 percent of the states support, a huge lead over Kasich at 25 percent, and Cruz at 17 percent ahead of the states April 19 primary. Trump held a rally in Bethpage, New York, on Wednesday evening where he referred only obliquely to his Wisconsin loss,  saying it takes guts to run for president and criticizing Cruz for drawing small crowds in the state. The Trump campaign also announced members of its New York-based team, including party leaders in each of the states 27 congressional districts. Its very important for Trump to bounce back strong. The sense of his inevitability is one of his strengths, said David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Center at Southern Illinois University. Cruz met with black and Hispanic religious leaders earlier in the day in the New York City borough of the Bronx. The men and women of Wisconsin resoundingly rejected (Trumps) campaign, Cruz told reporters afterward. Donald has no solutions to the problems that were facing. A Reuters/Ipsos poll on Tuesday showed Cruz statistically even with Trump among Republicans nationally. His recent gains marked the first time since November that a rival had threatened Trumps standing at the head of the Republican pack. Trump has 743 delegates, Cruz 517, and Kasich 143, according to an Associated Press count. Trump would need to win about 55 percent of the remaining delegates to reach the 1,237 threshold. We fully expect this to go to Cleveland, Packer said of the anti-Trump effort. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders, a Brooklyn-born U.S. senator representing Vermont, is trying to stage a come-from-behind upset of Hillary Clinton, but will struggle to overcome a large deficit in delegates.  Sanders big win in Wisconsin, which brought his victory tally to six out of the last seven contests, added to Clintons frustration over her inability to knock out a rival who has attacked her from the left. That frustration was on full display on Wednesday when the former secretary of state gave two live televised interviews in which she criticized Sanders. In contrast to a Republican primary season that has been rife with personal insults, the Democrats have largely avoided personal attacks and stuck to policy arguments. But Clinton attacked Sanders for his position on guns and said he lacked a depth of policy understanding. You cant really help people if you dont know how to do what you say you want to do, Clinton said on MSNBCs Morning Joe. She criticized him for an interview to New Yorks Daily News in which he failed to offer specifics on how he would break up large banks - a key part of his campaign message - when he was asked how he would put to use the existing financial regulation Dodd-Frank law.  Its not clear that he knows how Dodd-Frank works, Clinton told CNN in an interview on Wednesday afternoon.  The Democratic Party nominating race moves to Wyoming on Saturday before New York on April 19.  ",politicsNews,"April 6, 2016 ",1
Tennessee bill would allow counselors to deny service based on religion,"(Reuters) - The Tennessee House passed a bill on Wednesday allowing mental health counselors to refuse service to patients on religious grounds, the latest in a list of U.S. state measures that gay rights activists have criticized as discriminating against the LGBT community.  A vote by the state House of Representatives protects therapists and counselors from civil lawsuits and criminal action if they deny services to clients whose religious beliefs conflict with their own. The bill passed by a 68-22 vote and sent to Gov. Bill Haslam for his signature. The state Senate passed the bill earlier this year. Supporters of the bill say it protects the rights of counselors who object on religious grounds to the adopted code of ethics of the American Counseling Association. But opponents say it is an attempt to deny service to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, a vulnerable population often in need of counseling services. The House bill, which was sponsored by Republican Rep. Dan Howell, is one of many that are being challenged by human rights organizations claiming the legislation is anti-LGBT. Howell was unavailable for comment Wednesday afternoon. The Tennessee Equality Project, which supports gay rights, condemned the House passage of the bill even though it does not specifically refer to the LGBT issue. The group called on the governor to veto the legislation. Haslam told Nashville Public Radio he has not decided whether to sign or veto the counseling legislation, but he was considering the impact it may have on the state and its citizens. They (state lawmakers) need to obviously always vote their conscience, he told the radio station. One of the things, though, that we should be mindful of is, is there a broader impact? On Tuesday, PayPal Holdings Inc canceled plans to open a global operations center in Charlotte, North Carolina and invest $3.6 million in the area after the state passed a law requiring people to use bathrooms or locker rooms in schools and other public facilities that match the gender on their birth certificate rather than their gender identity. Tennessee is considering similar legislation related to school bathrooms, and civil rights groups are watching a Missouri measure seen as discriminatory. Last week, the governors of Georgia and Virginia vetoed religious liberty bills. Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant on Tuesday signed a far-reaching law allowing people with religious objections to deny wedding services to same-sex couples and protecting other actions considered discriminatory by gay rights activists.

How Ted Cruz win in Supreme Court hurt U.S.-Mexico relations,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz often tells supporters about his Supreme Court win against the federal government in 2008, defending Texas right to execute a Mexican man for murder, as evidence of his conservative and anti-establishment credentials. But there is one part of the story that goes untold. The Medellin v. Texas case, decided when Cruz was the states solicitor general, set the stage for years of diplomatic tension between the United States and its southern neighbor. Mexico has publicly protested U.S. executions of its citizens over the years, but interviews with diplomats and reviews of official Mexican government communiqus reveal that the turmoil caused by the Medellin case ran deeper, coming up at nearly every meeting between the United States and Mexico and leading to an official protest to the United Nations Security Council in 2014. Given the level of frustration, Cruzs role in the court battle raises questions about U.S.-Mexico relations if he were to beat billionaire Donald Trump to the Republican nomination and win the U.S. presidential election in November.   I think relations would be complicated with a President Cruz, said Sergio Alcocer, who was Mexicos deputy foreign minister responsible for North America between 2012-2015. Alcocer praised Cruz as intelligent and pragmatic but said the senator was too inflexible on issues like immigration and the death penalty. Cruz takes certain positions that are very clearly defined. And hes much more conservative, much more dogmatic than Trump, Alcocer said. A Cruz campaign official did not respond to requests for comment. In Mexico City, a foreign ministry spokesman said Mexico had no preference among the U.S. presidential candidates and would not comment on the election. In the Medellin case, Cruz defended the death sentence a Texas court imposed on Mexican citizen Jose Ernesto Medellin after he was convicted in 1994 for his role in the gang rape and strangling of two teenage girls in a Houston park.  In 2004, the International Court of Justice of the United Nations ruled that Texas and other states had violated the Vienna Convention by failing to notify Medellin and 50 other Mexicans on death row of their right to contact the Mexican consulate after arrest. President George W. Bush ordered Texas and other states to review the sentences. Cruz argued that, while the United States had submitted to the international courts decisions, the White House could not implement an international agreement that required states to change their court procedures without action by Congress.The Supreme Court agreed in a 6-3 decision. Winning the case raised Cruzs profile in conservative circles. He has recently said he would appoint justices who would narrowly interpret the Constitution - as he did in the Medellin case - a crucial talking point in theelection following the death of Supreme Court conservative icon Antonin Scalia.  It was an unusual thing at the time for the state of Texas to be standing up against the president of the United States in front of the Supreme Court, particularly when that president was a Texan and a Republican and the former governor of this state, Cruz told cheering supporters at a Houston rally in February, one of the many times he has brought up the case. The Supreme Court ruling removed a potential legal barrier to three more executions of Mexican nationals in Texas who had been part of the same international court case as Medellin, even as U.S. allies such as the European Union and Switzerland criticized what they saw as ongoing treaty violations.  Mexico pressed U.S. officials and Congress to follow the international courts directive and require states to review death sentences where people had been denied consular access. The issue came up as one of the top few issues (Mexico) raised in almost every bilateral meeting we had, said Harold Hongju Koh, who was legal adviser to the U.S. State Department from 2009-2013. Alcocer, the former Mexican deputy foreign minister, confirmed the issue of consular access was raised during negotiations on other cross-border issues like the extradition of criminals.  Its not resolved, and its something that Mexico needs to keep insisting on, he said in an interview. Mexican officials said both the Bush and Obama administrations had been open to working on the issue. U.S. State Department officials supported consular-access legislation introduced in the Senate, but that was not enough to spur Congress to resolve the issue. Texas executed Medellin in August 2008, five months after the Supreme Court decision, drawing swift criticism from the United Nations court.  Three years later, as Texas prepared to execute another Mexican national who had not received consular access, Mexicos then-ambassador to the United States, Arturo Sarukhan, wrote to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton saying the action would seriously jeopardize cooperation on a range of issues. It serves neither the United States nor the Mexico-U.S. relationship if the U.S. cannot live up to its treaty obligations, said the letter, which was reviewed by Reuters.  In 2013, Mexico warned Washington in another letter that the executions of Mexican nationals who had been denied consular access would mean our whole forward-looking bilateral engagement could be questioned. A year later the government wrote to the president of the United Nations Security Council expressing indignation over the executions of Mexican citizens in violation of the international court directive.  Sarukhan, the former Mexican ambassador, said Mexico had few options to put pressure on the United States without harming cooperation in other areas.  March 31st marks now 12 years since the decision was rendered and the United States is yet to comply with its international obligations, the government said in a statement, responding to Reuters questions about the Medellin case and Cruzs involvement in it. Critics of the Medellin ruling, and Cruzs boasts about it, say Texas could have simply reviewed the sentences as the international court had asked.     Texas could have provided that remedy 20 times over in the time that it took to litigate that case up and down through the Texas courts and the Supreme Court, said Sandra Babcock, a law professor at Cornell University who was one of Medellins attorneys. The long-term damage, the reputational damage to the United States is still ongoing. But Cruzs supporters dismiss such criticism. His job as solicitor general was to defend Texas, not to worry about the international implications, they say.  Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a former attorney general who was Cruzs boss at the time of the Medellin case, introduced the presidential hopeful at the February rally in Houston.  He fought against the United Nations, the world court and the United States of America itself to defend Texas sovereignty, Abbott said to cheers. ",politicsNews,"April 5, 2016 ",1
Trump would try to squeeze Mexico into funding border wall,"WASHINGTON - Donald Trump proposed on Tuesday forcing Mexico to pay for his planned border wall by threatening to block remittances from illegal immigrants, which he said amounts to welfare for poor families in Mexico that their government does not provide. The Republican presidential candidates campaign said in a memo that if elected in November, Trump would use a U.S. anti-terrorism law to cut off such money transfers unless Mexico made a one-time payment of $5 billion to $10 billion for the wall. Trumps pledge to build the wall has been a much-touted highlight of a platform targeting illegal immigration in the United States that has helped make him the front-runner to be the Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election.  It is unclear how much a wall along the nearly 2,000-mile (3,200-km) U.S.-Mexico border would cost, and Mexico has been adamant it would not pay. The memo elaborated on an idea Trump floated in August, when he suggested seizing all remittances tied to illegal wages. It said that upon taking office a Trump administration would propose a rule mandating companies such as Western Union Co WU.N to require customers to prove they were legally in the United States. If Mexico agreed to fund the wall, Trump would drop the proposed rule, it said. Its an easy decision for Mexico, his campaign said, adding the country receives about $24 billion a year in remittances from Mexicans in the United States, most of them in the country illegally. It (remittances) serves as de facto welfare for poor families in Mexico. There is no significant social safety net provided by the state in Mexico, it said.  According to the World Bank Remittances project, flows from the U.S. to Mexico in 2014, the last full year for which it has data, were nearly $24 billion although it is unclear what portion comes from Mexicans living in the country illegally. Democratic President Barack Obama called the remittance-blocking idea impractical and possibly self-defeating. The notion that were going to track every Western Union bit of money thats being sent to Mexico, you know, good luck with that, he told reporters. If Mexicos economy collapses, it would just drive more immigrants to the United States, Obama added.  Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto appeared to dismiss the proposal as campaign rhetoric. The (Mexican) Presidency has no comment on any opinion made in the heat of the electoral process to choose candidates for the U.S. presidency, the presidents office said in a text message to Reuters.  Any move to target payments sent home by people living in the United States could have a crushing financial effect in Mexico, the leading recipient of U.S. remittances.  Trumps proposal could also affect banks and companies that handle wire transfers, which also include MoneyGram International Inc (MGI.O) and PayPal Holdings Incs (PYPL.O) Xoom.  The companies did not respond to requests for comment. In addition to his wall proposal, Trump has accused Mexico of sending rapists and drug runners to the United States. Democrats and many Republicans have repeatedly condemned his comments as inflammatory, but his remarks have been enthusiastically received by his supporters, especially by white working-class voters. In the memo, first reported by The Washington Post, Trumps campaign repeated its pledge to target visas. It also cited imposing trade tariffs or enforcing existing trade rules as a way of forcing Mexico to pay. Trump supporter Benjamin Proto, a Connecticut lawyer, acknowledged the remittance plan was unrealistic but praised the candidate for looking at different ways to do things. The memo emerged as Republican candidate Ted Cruz appeared set to beat Trump in Wisconsins primary contest on Tuesday, a win he would hope would mark him as the best alternative to the New York billionaire.

Obama urges Congress to take action on corporate tax reform,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Tuesday urged Congress to take action to stop U.S. companies from taking advantage of tax loopholes that allow them to avoid paying taxes. When companies exploit loopholes like this... it sticks the rest of us with the tab and it makes hard-working Americans feel like the deck is stacked against them, Obama told reporters at the White House, adding that wealthy corporations and individuals should not be gaming the system. Obama, a Democrat, has called repeatedly for action by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress on tax-avoiding corporate inversions, which lowers companies tax bills by allowing them to redomicile overseas even though their core operations and management usually remain in the United States. So far, lawmakers have done little. The U.S. Treasury Department took more decisive actions to crack down on inversions late on Monday, that imperils a number of proposed mergers, including Pfizer Incs (PFE.N) $160 billion agreement to buy Dublin-based Allergan Plc (AGN.N). I want to be clear. While the Treasury Departments actions will make it more difficult... to exploit this particular corporate inversions loophole, only Congress can close it for good, Obama said.

Alabama governor to face impeachment push in state legislature,"(Reuters) - Alabama Governor Robert Bentley will face a legislative effort seeking his impeachment, a state lawmaker said on Tuesday, announcing the start of formal proceedings amid escalating political fallout over his relationship with a former advisor. Bentley, a two-term Republican governor, has apologized for making inappropriate remarks to the married ex-staffer, while denying allegations of a physical affair. Since he acknowledged the accusations two weeks ago, he has been dogged by questions about their relationship and potentially inappropriate use of state resources. State representative Ed Henry, also a Republican, held a news conference on Tuesday to discuss impeachment proceedings, acknowledging uncertainty about exactly how they would unfold. We are looking at this governor that has essentially betrayed the trust of the people of Alabama, he said, calling on Bentley to step down. Weve never done this before. Weve never tried to impeach a governor, added Henry, who spoke alongside several state representatives who support impeachment. He drafted articles of impeachment that accuse Bentley of corruption, incompetence, immoral behavior, and neglecting his duties as governor. In response, Bentley issued a statement calling the effort a distraction from pending issues before the state legislature. There are no grounds for impeachment, and I will vigorously defend myself and my administration from this political attack, said Bentley, a medical doctor who easily won re-election to a second term in November 2014.  The senior advisor in question, Rebekah Mason, resigned last week. She said she intended to focus on her husband and children and did not address the alleged affair. Funding for her salary was among the issues questioned in the impeachment documents. Discussions about their relationship have dominated Alabama politics since March 23 when Bentley was publicly accused of having an affair by Spencer Collier, the former head of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, just after he was fired by the governor. Audio recordings have emerged that depict Bentley making suggestive comments to Mason, according to state media reports.  Bentleys wife filed for divorce in August 2015 after 50 years of marriage, citing unspecified problems. ",politicsNews,"April 5, 2016 ",1
"U.S. weakens retirement advice rule, responding to industry","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new U.S. rule aimed at protecting retirement savers from profit-hungry brokers turned out to be much weaker than an initial proposal after the Obama administration bowed to pressure from the financial services industry. The rule, announced by the Department of Labor on Wednesday, sets a so-called fiduciary standard for financial brokers who sell retirement products, requiring them to put clients best interests ahead of their bottom line. The language is tougher than an existing rule that only requires brokers to ensure products are suitable. However, the Labor Department did compromise with the industry on a range of provisions. Unlike the draft proposal, the final rule does not restrict brokers from pushing proprietary products, splitting revenue with creators of funds they promote, or recommending risky, high-fee investments in alternative assets and certain annuities. Brokers also got more time to implement the changes, which they said were costly and difficult. The rule will now take full effect on Jan. 1, 2018, compared with an eight-month compliance deadline in the Labor Departments initial proposal. Nonetheless, brokers will now be covered by a fiduciary standard, said Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a consumer advocate who helped shine a national spotlight on the proposal last year. Theres no doubt there is some risk, Warren, a Democrat, said in an interview. On the other hand, the Department of Labor was not looking to put all proprietary products out of business, Warren said. The goal is to make sure there is adequate regulation, said Warren, adding that she now believes there will be. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton issued a statement in support of the new rule, saying it will stop Wall Street from ripping off families and save seniors billions. However, Knut Rostad, an investor advocate who chairs the Institute for the Fiduciary Standard, said he was disappointed that the final rule was not tougher, calling it a major defeat for investors, period. Some leading Republican lawmakers also expressed continued opposition to the rule, saying it would prevent low- and middle-income Americans from saving for retirement or getting access to advice. Several major brokerage firms said they needed time to review the implications, but that they generally supported the idea of a best interest rule. Industry trade groups reiterated concerns that the rule could have negative effects. But several Wall Street analysts who cover brokerages, insurers and mutual fund companies affected by the rule said it turned out to be much less onerous than initially feared. Shares of brokerage, mutual fund and life insurance companies showed little reaction to the news. The Labor Department meaningfully softened the rule, Morgan Stanley insurance analysts said, characterizing it as good news for those companies impacted. Wednesdays announcement caps a fierce, six-year battle involving the Labor Department, Wall Street and many U.S. lawmakers. The Department received more than 3,000 letters about the rule and took part in more than 100 meetings. It first issued a proposal in 2010 but rescinded it the following year in response to an enormous industry backlash. A second proposal issued last year also faced criticism. Firms have said the rule would raise compliance costs, and therefore fees, and force them to get rid of Main Street clients and small businesses that offer 401(k) plans.  The Labor Department said complying with the rule would cost the brokerage industry up to $31.5 billion over the next decade but produce even bigger gains for investors. Some lawmakers said the Labor Department should hold off until the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission finalizes its own fiduciary rule, which it has been crafting for years. SEC Commissioner Michael Piwowar expressed opposition to the final rule on Wednesday. President Barack Obama had made a new fiduciary rule a priority for his administration. In a speech at AARP headquarters last year, he said Wall Street brokers were bilking retirees out of billions of dollars in savings through hidden fees and that he intended to ensure the industry put clients interests first. If expecting retirement advisers to act in their clients best interest sounds like its pretty obvious  and its pretty obviously the right thing to do  its because it is, Jeff Zients, director of the White Houses National Economic Council, said in a call with reporters. Although the final rule did include the best-interest provision, it made plenty of concessions. For example, the draft listed types of assets that advisers could recommend to steer retail investors away from certain high-risk products. The final version eliminates that list, mostly in response to the financial industrys concerns, the Labor Department said. Brokerages and lawmakers were also concerned about an earlier requirement that brokers sign contracts with clients at initial meetings. The document was to include investment projections, fee disclosures and other detailed information.  The contracts are required in the final rule, but can be as short as a paragraph, signed later and tucked into paperwork that customers sign when opening new accounts, Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said. The final version also loosened guidelines on pay, allowing advisers to collect common types of compensation, such as commissions and revenue-sharing, where brokerages receive payments from mutual-fund companies to help promote products.

Republicans offer bill to block potential Iran dollar use,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Republican U.S. senators who oppose the nuclear agreement with Iran introduced a bill on Wednesday that would keep Iran from gaining even indirect access to the U.S. financial system or using U.S. dollars in business transactions. The measure introduced by Senators Mark Kirk and Marco Rubio came amid media reports that U.S. officials were moving toward allowing such transactions. President Barack Obama has denied having such plans. The legislation would prohibit the president from issuing any license for conducting an offshore U.S. dollar clearing system for Iranian transactions or providing any such system with U.S. dollars. It also would impose secondary sanctions on any financial institution found to be participating in any offshore dollar clearing system with Iran. State Department spokesman Mark Toner acknowledged the United States was advising banks and other businesses about how to conduct business with Tehran without running afoul of U.S. authorities, but that does not involve converting money to dollars. These banks dont want to violate existing sanctions, he said, but they are allowed to under certain condition to do business with Iran, so we do consider it as an obligation on how to counsel them. Along with some of Obamas fellow Democrats, congressional Republicans unanimously opposed the deal announced in July in which Iran agreed to scale back its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Several lawmakers have been working on legislation since to keep tight controls on Iran, especially over its repeated ballistic missile tests since late last year. U.S. Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, published a column in the Washington Post on Wednesday saying Obama was so eager to preserve a signature foreign policy agreement that he would consider measures that would let Iran launder dollars while the administration looked the other way. The issue is particularly potent in this U.S. election year, when Americans will pick a new president, and every member of the House and one-third of senators are up for re-election. The three remaining Republican presidential candidates have all vowed to tear up or back away from the nuclear deal, which Obama administration officials say would be calamitous. Rubio suspended his 2016 presidential campaign last month, and Kirks Senate re-election race is seen as one of this years most competitive. ",politicsNews,"April 6, 2016 ",1
White House finds temporary fix in Zika funding fight,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Wednesday it will redirect $589 million in funds to prepare for the Zika virus before the mosquito that carries it begins to emerge in the continental United States, but urged Congress to act quickly on its request for more money. White House budget director Shaun Donovan said the use of money previously provided for fighting another health crisis, the Ebola virus, was only a temporary fix for Zika funding. Donovan said some measures to fight Zika would have to be delayed, curtailed or stopped unless the U.S. Congress approves more than $1.8 billion in emergency funds requested by the Obama administration in February. The Zika virus, linked to a growing number of cases of the birth defect microcephaly in Brazil, is spreading rapidly in Latin America and the Caribbean and heading north as the weather gets warmer. We should not play with fire here, Donovan told reporters on a conference call. Without full Zika funding, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said mosquito control and surveillance may have to be delayed or stopped, vaccine development could be jeopardized and development of faster diagnostic tests could be impaired. Most of the $589 million will come from $2.7 billion in funds set aside for public health projects aimed at the Ebola virus. West Africa was stricken by a two-year Ebola epidemic that killed more than 11,300 people starting in December 2013 and led to a small number of cases in the United States. The Republican-controlled Congress has said the White House should draw the money needed to fight Zika from the Ebola funds. Chairman Hal Rogers and other top Republicans on the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee said in a statement they would monitor the changing needs resulting from this unpredictable crisis to ensure that needed funds are available. Republicans are going to look back on this time that theyve had to act on the Zika virus and deeply regret it, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. Burwell said a recent flare-up of Ebola in West Africa shows the United States cannot shortchange its work in the region. We face two global health challenges, Ebola and Zika, and we dont have an option to set one aside in the name of the other, Burwell told reporters. Burwell said there were 672 confirmed cases of Zika infections in the United States, including 64 pregnant women. She said there was one confirmed case of Zika-related microcephaly in Hawaii. The World Health Organization has said there is a strong scientific consensus that Zika can cause microcephaly as well as Guillain-Barre syndrome, though proof may take months or years. Microcephaly is a condition defined by unusually small heads in babies that can result in developmental problems. Guillain-Barre syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis. Brazil said it has confirmed more than 940 cases of microcephaly, and considers most to be related to Zika infections in the mothers. Brazil is investigating nearly 4,300 additional suspected cases of microcephaly. ",politicsNews,"April 6, 2016 ",1
Factbox - Department of Labor retirement 'fiduciary' rule ,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Labor plans to announce on Wednesday its rule requiring financial advisers and brokers to act in the best interest of retirement clients when providing investment advice.   The agency first proposed a new rule in 2010 but withdrew it in 2011 after widespread criticism from financial industry officials and lawmakers. A modified version was presented in 2015 and also met with criticism. Here are some key provisions of the final rule, according to a White House fact sheet provided on Tuesday: - Financial brokers must now act in clients best interest when giving retirement investment advice. That is tougher than a previous standard in which they had to ensure products were suitable for clients. - Firms must ban financial incentives for advisers not to act in the clients best interest. - Firms must disclose compensation arrangements on a webpage and by making sure customers are aware of their right to all fee information. - The rule allows firms and advisers to continue receiving the most common forms of compensation for offering investment advice to retail customers and small-plan sponsors. The rule also does not limit the types of assets they can invest in. - Firms are allowed to sell insurance products like variable and indexed annuities under the best interest rule. - The rule clarifies treatment of small businesses that sponsor 401(k) plans, allowing brokers to sell products and services to them. - The rule allows firms and their advisers to recommend proprietary products. - Education is not included in the definition of retirement investment advice, allowing advisers to offer basic information without acting as fiduciaries. - Under the rule, financial advisers may communicate with potential clients before signing a contract. But firms must eventually tell new clients in writing that they are acting in their best interest, and any advice given before a contract is signed must be covered by the contract and meet the best interest standard. - To give firms more time to adapt to changes, the rule will be implemented in phases. Full compliance is required on Jan. 1, 2018. ",politicsNews,"April 6, 2016 ",1

U.S. securities regulator says 'disappointed' by retirement advice rule,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The sole Republican member of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Michael Piwowar, expressed deep skepticism about a retirement advice rule that the Labor Department released on Wednesday, a sign of potential conflict over the long-awaited regulation. I am disappointed that the rule announced today seems to ignore the chorus of voices that questioned whether it will restrict middle-class families and minority communities access to professional financial advice by making retirement advice unaffordable, Piwowar, an SEC commissioner, said in a statement. I am fearful that those concerns, which were widely and bipartisanly held, will prove to be true once the rule becomes effective.  The SEC, the countrys chief securities regulator has been crafting its own rule on retirement advice for years. Some lawmakers and industry members had said that the Labor Department, which oversees retirement laws, should hold off until that rule was finalized. Under the Labor rule that takes full effect Jan. 1, 2018, brokers would have to follow a fiduciary standard, acting in clients best interests when advising about retirement accounts. It aims to end potential conflicts of interest by brokers who advise on individual retirement accounts, and to protect consumers from buying unnecessary investment products. But after a draft was released last year, members of both political parties, along with financial services firms, expressed concern that the rule would drive up costs and put professional advice out of reach for middle and lower-income people.

"Mexico replaces top U.S. diplomats, citing hostile climate","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexicos government on Tuesday unexpectedly changed two of its top officials responsible for U.S. relations, citing concerns about an increasingly anti-Mexican climate across the border. Carlos Sada, previously the consul in Los Angeles, was named ambassador to the United States while Paulo Carreno, one of President Enrique Pena Nietos communications chiefs, was appointed the deputy foreign minister for North America. The new ambassador must still be approved by the Senate. We have been warning that our citizens have begun to feel a more hostile climate, Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu told local radio after the announcement. This (anti-Mexican) rhetoric has made it clear that we have to act in a different way so that this tendency being generated doesnt damage the bilateral relationship, she added. Mexican government officials have expressed concern about the rise of Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump due to his repeated verbal attacks on Mexico, and his insistence that Mexico should be made to pay for a border wall. Trump on Tuesday threatened to block remittances from undocumented Mexican migrants if elected president unless the country pays billions for his planned wall. Trump also called Fords announcement that it would build more cars in Mexico an absolute disgrace. ",politicsNews,"April 5, 2016 ",1
"Republican Cruz crushes Trump in Wisconsin, says party will unite","MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - Republican Ted Cruz easily won the Wisconsin presidential primary on Tuesday, dealing a blow to front-runner Donald Trumps hopes of amassing enough delegates for the partys nomination and boosting chances of a rare contested convention. Cruzs double-digit win over Trump was a breakthrough for Republican Party forces battling to block the controversial New York billionaire, and it raised the prospect of a prolonged nomination fight that could last to the July convention in Cleveland, Ohio. Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders also won in Wisconsin, gaining momentum in his fight against front-runner Hillary Clinton and trimming her commanding lead in delegates. Trump entered the night with 737 convention delegates to Cruzs 481, leaving him 500 delegates short of the 1,237 needed to become the partys nominee in the Nov. 8 election. Cruz said the result in Wisconsin showed the party was beginning to rally behind him, but he acknowledged the growing possibility that the fight could go all the way to the convention. Either before Cleveland, or at the convention in Cleveland, together we will win a majority of the delegates and together we will beat Hillary Clinton in November, Cruz told cheering supporters in Milwaukee. Were winning because were uniting the Republican Party. Cruz, a conservative U.S. senator from Texas, was aided in Wisconsin by Republican Governor Scott Walker, who dropped his own presidential bid in September, and by a barrage of ads from Super PACS - independent funding groups - backed by party establishment figures worried that Trump will lead Republicans to a broad defeat in November. Trumps campaign released a blistering statement saying Cruz had been propped up by countless millions of dollars of false advertising from anti-Trump Super PACs. Ted Cruz is worse than a puppet -  he is a Trojan horse, being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. Trump, the Trump campaign statement said. The Wisconsin primary capped a difficult week for Trump, who was forced to backtrack after saying women who have abortions should face punishment if the procedure is outlawed, and who voiced support for his campaign manager after he was charged with misdemeanor assault for grabbing a reporter. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll on Tuesday showed Cruz about even with Trump nationally, with Cruzs recent gains the first time since November that a Trump rival has threatened his standing at the head of the Republican pack. The poll of 568 Republicans, taken between April 1-5, showed Cruz winning the support of 35 percent of Republicans to Trumps 39 percent. Cruz and Trump were also briefly about even early last week. In the Democratic race, the win for Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is his sixth in the last seven contests for the nomination. Sanders said his message of breaking up big banks, reining in Wall Street and reducing income inequality was bringing new and young voters into the process. What we have been seeing throughout this campaign is extraordinary voter turnout in state after state, Sanders said at a rally in Laramie, Wyoming. Clinton, who did not appear in public on Tuesday night, tweeted her congratulations to Sanders. Congrats to @BernieSanders on winning Wisconsin, Clinton said on Twitter. To all the voters and volunteers who poured your hearts into this campaign: Forward! -H. Sanders still faces a difficult task overtaking Clinton as the race moves to New York on April 19 and to five other Eastern states on April 26. Heading into Tuesday, Clinton led Sanders by 263 pledged delegates in the race for the 2,383 needed to be nominated at the partys July convention in Philadelphia. She also has a big lead in superdelegates, who are party leaders free to back any candidate. Sanders needs to win up to two-thirds of the remaining delegates to catch Clinton, who will keep accumulating delegates even when she loses under a Democratic Party system that awards them proportionally in all states. Sanders needs to rack up big winning margins over Clinton in the remaining states to close the gap. He has vowed to stay in the race until the convention, and his campaign says superdelegates could begin to shift their support to him if they see he has popular support.

Puerto Rico GO bondholders issue proposal for restructuring,"SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Bondholders with nearly a third of Puerto Ricos $17 billion outstanding General Obligation bonds on Tuesday unveiled a proposal for a debt restructuring they claim would help the island avoid outright default. Burdened by an overall $70 billion debt load that the government says it cannot pay and a 45 percent poverty rate that has led to a steady exodus of its American citizens back to the mainland, Puerto Rico faces economic collapse without a solution that either changes laws and/or involves an agreement with creditors. The bondholders, representing $5 billion of GO debt say they would defer principal repayments on their bonds through June 2020. The proposal was issued by an ad hoc group of GO bondholders, including mutual funds and others, represented by the law firm Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison.    In addition, the creditors said they would buy approximately $750 million in new debt at a 7 percent annual coupon and no principal repayments until 2020. This exchange would save the Commonwealth $1.9 billion in debt service payments over the next five years, according to the document. Puerto Ricos government said the proposal failed to solve the severe and real challenges facing Puerto Rico. Incurring additional debt at a higher cost is not the answer to the Commonwealths fiscal issues, Melba Acosta, president of Puerto Ricos Government Development Bank, said in a statement. Indeed it is exactly the type of Wall Street solution that led us to the precipice we are now looking over. The same bondholders earlier criticized legislation currently being rushed through Puerto Ricos Senate and House on Tuesday that would halt bond payments ahead of a $422 million debt bill owed by the Government Development Bank due on May 1. The Senate approved the controversial legislation early on Tuesday morning while the House continued its debate. It is expected to vote before the end of the day. While we would like to negotiate with the Puerto Rican Government in private and in good faith, the debt moratorium it has proposed that is before the Puerto Rican legislature has prompted this public release, Andrew Rosenberg, a lawyer with Paul, Weiss said in a statement accompanying the proposal. GO debt is backed by the full faith and credit of the government and is typically the senior debt paid before all others. ",politicsNews,"April 5, 2016 ",1
Republican Collins' call for Garland hearings spurned,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A moderate Republican senator heaped praise on President Barack Obamas U.S. Supreme Court nominee on Tuesday, bucking Senate Republican leaders who promptly dismissed her call for confirmation hearings. Susan Collins of Maine became only the second Republican senator to meet with Merrick Garland since Obama nominated the centrist appellate judge last month to fill the court vacancy left by the Feb. 13 death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The hourlong meeting came as Republican senators face mounting pressure from conservative activists to go along with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells plan to block any nominee chosen by Obama. The meeting left me more convinced than ever that the process should proceed. The next step, in my view, should be public hearings before the Judiciary Committee, Collins told reporters. About two hours later, McConnell told reporters: Its safe to say there will not be hearings or votes on Garland. McConnell and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley have said Obamas successor, who will be elected on Nov. 8 and take office on Jan. 20, should fill Scalias vacancy. The court is now split 4-4 between conservatives and liberals, meaning Scalias successor could influence its ideological direction for years to come. Collins called Garland well-informed, thoughtful, impressive, extraordinarily bright and with a sensitivity toward the roles assigned under the Constitution to the governments executive, legislative and judicial branches. The White House said Garland would meet next week with Republican Senators Kelly Ayotte, Rob Portman, Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake for courtesy visits.  Garland met last week with Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois, who called fellow Republicans closed-minded for refusing to consider the nomination. Grassley has invited Garland to a breakfast meeting to explain why he will not hold hearings, a Grassley spokeswoman said on Monday. Democrats kept up their attack on Republicans for blocking Garland. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, said if McConnell stood firm, Garland would be the first presidential nominee to the Supreme Court in history to be denied a hearing. Flake said if a Democrat wins the presidential election, Garland should be confirmed by the Senate in a heartbeat during a post-election legislative session. Some Republicans are concerned that Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, would select a more liberal nominee than Garland. Flakes fellow Republican Judiciary Committee member Lindsey Graham dismissed the idea of a lame-duck session to confirm Garland. Graham said Garland would not be confirmed, adding: Whats the purpose of a hearing, just to beat him up? ",politicsNews,"April 5, 2016 ",1
"Puerto Rico, creditors trade barbs over debt freeze bill","SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Ricos House of Representatives on Tuesday debated a bill to halt debt payments, while a government official fired back at creditors who suggested the U.S. territory was shirking efforts to hold restructuring talks. Burdened by a $70 billion debt load it says it cannot pay and a 45 percent poverty rate that has led to a steady exodus of its American citizens to the mainland, Puerto Rico faces economic collapse without a solution that either changes laws and/or involves an agreement with creditors. The next key date is May 1 when the Government Development Bank, the islands primary fiscal agent, is due to pay creditors $422 million. The islands Senate passed an emergency bill early on Tuesday that would alter GDBs structure, as well as allow Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla to declare a moratorium on any debt payment he deems necessary. The House was expected to vote on the bill on Tuesday. A group of Puerto Ricos general obligation bondholders criticized the bill. It is no coincidence that the governor has abruptly sought overnight adoption of debt moratorium legislation at the very moment large general obligation bondholders were arriving on the island to pursue a consensual restructuring, the creditors said in a statement on Tuesday. That group, holding about $5 billion debt, then released a proposed restructuring plan that would defer principal repayments and offer new debt, a plan they say would save Puerto Rico from default. GDB President Melba Acosta disputed the notion that officials were blowing off creditors, saying Puerto Rico held meetings with creditors in March, presenting updated restructuring proposals.  We have not received an actionable, binding financing commitment from anyone, and we have received no offers that would lead Puerto Rico towards a stable and prosperous economy for years to come, Acosta said in a statement to Reuters. We sincerely hope that the proposals that the advisers to our GO holders speak of are not a public relations stunt that attempts to mislead the public and distract leaders in Congress from the real work at hand, she added. GDB is also holding consensual restructuring talks with its own creditors. Legislative efforts in the U.S. Congress to fix Puerto Ricos debt problem are not likely to come to fruition before the GDBs May 1 debt payment. On Monday, some GDB creditors sued to try to prevent a run on the bank as negotiations play out, asking a court to bar the GDB from paying certain creditors and preventing depositors from withdrawing money.  A source close to the matter told Reuters some government agencies were planning to open new accounts at other banks, but denied those agencies were removing money from the GDB.

Senator Grassley to meet Garland despite opposition to nominee ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley has invited Judge Merrick Garland to breakfast, but absent from the menu will be any promise of hearings on President Barack Obamas nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court. A spokeswoman for Grassley said that the Republican senator spoke with Garland late on Monday and extended the invitation where they could discuss the nomination and why the Senate will not consider a nominee until the next president takes office. The Senate Judiciary Committee is in charge of holding hearings on Supreme Court nominees chosen by the president and deciding whether to recommend full Senate confirmation. Most of the Senates 54 Republicans have indicated opposition to confirming any high-court nominee of Obamas, saying the choice should be made by the next president, who would be elected on Nov. 8 and sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017. Despite the wall of Republican opposition to Garland, who is considered a moderate federal appeals court judge, Obama and his fellow Democrats continue to push for Senate confirmation this year. Garland already has made several courtesy calls to senators, mostly Democrats, and will continue his visits to Capitol Hill this week. If he were to be confirmed, Garland - nominated to fill the vacancy created by the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia - would tilt the Supreme Court to the left for the first time in decades. The race for a replacement for Obama, who is completing his second and final term as president, is in full swing now with billionaire businessman Donald Trump leading two other Republican candidates and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. But it could be weeks or months before the two political parties settle on their respective candidates. A date for the breakfast meeting has not yet been set, Grassleys spokeswoman said.",politicsNews,"April 4, 2016 ",1
Trump calls Ford building plant in Mexico 'an absolute disgrace',"DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said the move by Ford Motor Co (F.N) to build a manufacturing plant in Mexico is an absolute disgrace and shows the need to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Earlier on Tuesday, Ford confirmed plans to build a plant in San Luis Potosi and an investment of $1.6 billion. This transaction is an absolute disgrace, said Trumps statement, sent to Reuters by email. Our dishonest politicians and the special interests that control them are laughing in the face of all American citizens. Trump said deals like the one Michigan-based Ford made to build a plant in Mexico will continue until we can renegotiate NAFTA to create a fair deal for American workers. Ford did not have an immediate comment on Trumps statement, but two weeks ago its chief executive, Mark Fields, said Ford would not back away from foreign investments if they made sense. We are a global, multinational company and we will invest to keep us competitive and we will do what makes sense for the business, Fields said. Ford currently has more workers and makes more vehicles at its U.S. plants than do Detroit rivals General Motors Co (GM.N) or Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU.N) (FCHA.MI), and has fewer workers and makes fewer vehicles in Mexico than the other automakers. GM has about 12,000 hourly paid workers in Mexico, while FCA has 9,547 and Ford has 6,191, the companies said on Tuesday. In the United States, Ford has 55,300 hourly paid plant workers, GM has 54,000 and FCA has 36,600, the companies said. In 2015, 80 percent of Fords North American production came from its U.S. plants while 63 percent of GMs North American production came from its U.S. plants and for FCA 64 percent of its North American production came from its U.S. plants.

House ethics committee continues probe of Florida's Grayson,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The ethics committee of the U.S. House of Representatives said on Tuesday it would continue to investigate possible conflicts of interest by Representative Alan Grayson, a Florida Democrat and liberal firebrand running for the Senate seat soon to be vacated by Marco Rubio.      The possible conflicts of interest relate to Graysons roles as both a hedge fund manager and a member of Congress. The committee in a statement said the matter needed further review; it gave no time frame for completion. Grayson has denied any wrongdoing. In a statement Tuesday, his campaign called the ethics probe a political witch hunt. The extension means the issue will still hover over a race that is seen as key to Democrats bid to wrest control of the Senate from Republicans in Novembers elections. The primary is in August. The New York Times reported in February that emails and the funds marketing documents showed Grayson had promoted his international travels, some with congressional delegations, to solicit business for the fund, in possible violation of House ethics rules.  The larger picture here is that the Washington political establishment has decided who their favored candidate is, and its not Rep. Grayson, the statement from Graysons campaign said. Top Democrats have tried to get Grayson to drop out of the Florida Senate race because of the questions about the hedge fund, throwing their support to Democratic opponent Representative Patrick Murphy. President Barack Obama has endorsed Murphy, and Vice President Joe Biden has campaigned with Murphy. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said earlier this year that Graysons actions had disgraced Congress and that he should leave the Senate race immediately.  But Grayson has been endorsed by some grassroots liberal groups who appreciate his outspokenness. One of his more famous lines, delivered during the Obamacare debate in 2009, was that the Republican health-care plan for America amounted to dont get sick, and if you do, die quickly. The New York Times reported that Grayson had created the hedge fund in 2011 after losing a race for re-election to Congress, and kept it open after he was re-elected in 2012. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange, the fund had been called the Grayson Fund, but Grayson changed the name to Sibylline Fund LP. The Times reported the fund had closed branches previously located in the Cayman Islands. Rubio, who recently ended a campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, leaves the Senate after this year after just one term. Republicans seeking the seat include Representatives Ron DeSantis and David Jolly. ",politicsNews,"April 5, 2016 ",1
"Pentagon chief wants streamlined, more nimble U.S. military structure","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter on Tuesday called for changes in the U.S. military that would cut inefficiencies, streamline the acquisition process and improve the ability to respond quickly to threats such as Islamic State. The proposals by Carter, speaking to an audience at Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, cut across all branches of the Defense Department because they affect its top leadership and service chiefs. He said some of the measures could be put in place over the coming weeks under existing authority while others will require legislative action. Some of the proposals aim to overcome organizational inefficiencies within the vast U.S. military that Carter believes do not allow it to best address transregional threats like the one from the Islamic State militant group, which stretches from Afghanistan to Africa. Carters proposals, which did not go into specifics, follow a review of the Goldwater-Nichols law of 1986, which made sweeping changes to the structure of the U.S. military and has been criticized for being outdated. Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, looking at whether Goldwater-Nichols needed to be updated because of changing security threats including Islamic State and North Korea. Carter said the role of chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ought to be clarified to help move troops quickly across regional commands and provide military advice for current and future operations. He said the Pentagon would try to simplify some headquarters positions so that some jobs now filled by four-star generals could be done by lower-ranking officers in the future. Carter added that service chiefs would be involved more in making decisions on defense acquisitions. He said the Pentagon would seek to streamline the acquisitions process by reducing the amount of paperwork required. In order to make the acquisition process simpler, Carter said he would look at potentially reducing the number of members on the Defense Acquisition Board, which gives advice on acquisition programs. In recent congressional testimony, Michele Flournoy, a former top U.S. Department of Defense official, said the Goldwater-Nichols law was leading to a tyranny of consensus and bloated headquarters. Reaching a consensus had become an end in itself in too many areas, including strategy development and acquisition, she said in her written testimony. ",politicsNews,"April 5, 2016 ",1
Ex Representative Grimm's restaurant partner to plead guilty: lawyer,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A onetime business partner of former U.S. Representative Michael Grimm is preparing to plead guilty to a tax charge in a case related to the prosecution that led to the congressmans imprisonment, his lawyer said on Tuesday. Prosecutors in a filing in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, on Monday said they intend to file charges against Bennett Orfaly, Grimms former partner in Healthalicious, a restaurant at the center of the Republican politicians criminal case. James DiPietro, Orfalys lawyer, in an interview said his client is hoping to reach a quick resolution with a plea to a tax count. The filing on Monday said the case would relate to the one against Grimm, who represented a district in the New York City borough of Staten Island. Grimm was sentenced in July to eight months in prison after pleading guilty to tax fraud. DiPietro said that while the case stemmed from the investigation of Grimm, Orfaly will be charged in connection with other restaurants he owned. A deal could come as soon as next week or the following, he said. A spokeswoman for Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Robert Capers and a lawyer for Grimm both declined comment. The expected plea was first reported by the New York Daily News. Grimm, a former Marine who subsequently worked as an FBI agent, was elected in 2010 with a wave of conservative Tea Party Republicans advocating low taxes and government spending, but built a moderate voting record. From 2007 to 2010, Grimm oversaw the day-to-day operations of Healthalicious, which he co-founded with Orfaly, according to authorities. At a court hearing in 2012, a prosecutor, Anthony Capozzolo, said Orfaly had ties to a member of the Gambino family, Anthony Morelli, who was sentenced in 1996 to 20 years in prison in connection with a gas tax fraud. That statement came during a bail hearing for a former campaign fundraiser for Grimm, Ofer Biton, who later pleaded guilty to visa fraud in 2013. Grimm was subsequently indicted in April 2014 on tax charges related to Healthalicious and pleaded guilty that December to aiding and assisting the preparation of a false tax return. Prosecutors said Grimm under-reported wages paid to workers, many of whom did not have legal status in the United States, and concealed over $900,000 in Healthalicious gross receipts from an accountant who prepared the restaurants tax returns.

Illinois marked 14th straight budget deficit in FY 2015: audit,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois overall financial condition deteriorated in fiscal 2015 as tax collections fell, with the state recording its fourteenth straight budget deficit, according to an annual audit released on Tuesday. The nations fifth-largest state ended fiscal 2015 on June 30 with a general fund deficit that grew to $6.9 billion from $6.7 billion in fiscal 2014, the comprehensive annual financial report by Illinois Auditor General Frank Mautino showed. A temporary income tax hike enacted in 2011 partially expired midway through fiscal 2015, decreasing collections by $1.8 billion. The state continues to show an inability to generate sufficient cash from its current revenue structure to pay operating expenditures on a timely basis, the audit said. It also warned that budget deficits, along with growing unfunded liabilities for pensions and retiree healthcare, and credit rating downgrades may impact the states ability to access credit markets to pay operational expenditures more timely and may increase interest costs of those borrowings.  Illinois, which already pays a big penalty in the U.S. municipal bond market, has the worst-funded pensions and the lowest credit ratings among the 50 states. The state is in its 10th month without a full fiscal 2016 budget due to an impasse between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature.  Lawmakers returned to session this week after their spring break without any deal in sight for a fiscal 2016 or 2017 budget. The states liabilities, led by a $108.6 billion unfunded pension liability and $32.5 billion in payments due on bonds, dwarfed nearly $22 billion in assets, including buildings, infrastructure and equipment, resulting in a net deficit of $125.3 billion compared with $121.2 billion in fiscal 2014, the audit said. This left Illinois in the worst shape of the 42 U.S. states that have filed fiscal 2015 audits. Of the seven states that ended the fiscal year with a net position in the red - a list that also includes New Jersey, California and Kentucky - Illinois had the largest overall net deficit. Illinois budget stabilization fund was unchanged at $275.7 million, an insufficient amount to address cash management needs, according to state Comptroller Leslie Munger. Her office reported a $6.58 billion unpaid bill backlog on Tuesday. ",politicsNews,"April 5, 2016 ",1

Trump makes late push for support on eve of Wisconsin primary,"MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump tried to put a difficult week behind him and rally his supporters on Monday ahead of a crucial nominating contest in Wisconsin, where he was in the unfamiliar position of underdog. Opinion polls show Trump trailing U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the Midwestern state, where a loss on Tuesday could dent the New York billionaires aura of inevitability and make it harder for him to win the 1,237 delegates needed for the partys nomination for the Nov. 8 election. Trump hunted for support at two rallies in the state on Monday, telling voters in La Crosse, Wisconsin, they could propel him toward the nomination by delivering him a surprise victory over Cruz. If we do well here, folks, its over, Trump said. This could be the real beginning. If its not, I think we get there anyway, and Im pretty sure we get there anyway. Trump said an array of forces were aligned against him in Wisconsin, including the states governor, Scott Walker, who has backed Cruz, a very hostile media and party establishment figures worried he will lead Republicans to a broad defeat in November. He ridiculed the NeverTrump movement to block his nomination and said the party establishment should have put the same effort into beating Democratic President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. If they had worked this hard to stop Obama, Obama wouldnt have had a chance, Trump said at a rally in Superior, Wisconsin. He also said it was unfair that rival John Kasich, the governor of Ohio, refused to get out of the race despite trailing Trump and Cruz badly. Trump has won 736 delegates to the July nominating convention in Cleveland, but is still 501 short of the majority he needs to clinch the nomination. Rivals Cruz and Kasich hope to stop him short of a first-ballot victory and trigger a contested convention. My eyes are wide open, Trump said of the possibility the party establishment would maneuver to deny him the nomination at the convention. Were dealing with a corrupt system. Were dealing with a system that is not fair. Cruz told reporters the party was beginning to rally behind him, and said a win in Wisconsin would spark a surge of momentum for him in upcoming contests. What were seeing is the party unifying behind our campaign, Cruz said in Madison. I hope and believe tomorrow nights going to be a very good night here in Wisconsin. A Trump loss would cap a rough week, including an avalanche of criticism for his suggestion, which he later dialed back, that women be punished for getting abortions if the procedure is banned. Uncharacteristically, Trump also acknowledged that he made a mistake retweeting an attack on Cruzs wife, according to the New York Times. He also drew fire last week for saying he would not rule out using nuclear weapons in Europe and that Japan and South Korea might need their own nuclear arsenals to ease the U.S. financial commitment to their security. Trump told the crowd in Superior he had been advised that he should act more presidential but that if he did, it would be boring and only about 20 percent of you would be here. Cruz was eager to capitalize on Trumps missteps, talking about his family during a town hall session in an attempt to soften his strident image and appeal to women turned off by Trumps recent comments. At a later rally, Cruz told voters the entire country was looking toward Wisconsin. Lets show the country that this race is not about yelling and screaming and insults, he said in Madison. Even with a victory in Wisconsin, Cruz faces difficult odds to win the delegates needed to secure the nomination, given that the next states to vote, including New York on April 19 and five Northeastern states on April 26, are more Trump-friendly territory. Cruz has 463 delegates, 774 short of the total needed for the nomination, according to an Associated Press count. Kasich, with 143 delegates, has no chance to gather enough delegates to win on the first ballot but has refused to end his candidacy. He rejected Trumps call for him to get out of the race and poked fun at the front-runners complaints. Ive got news for him. Im gonna get a heck of a lot of his voters, he told a town hall meeting in Hempstead, New York. I know how to fix these things that the Trump voters care about. In the Democratic race, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has a small lead in opinion polls in Wisconsin over front-runner Hillary Clinton and is trying to add to his momentum after winning five of the last six contests. A Wisconsin win by Sanders would put the focus on the April 19 contest in New York, where Clinton was campaigning on Monday. Sanders still faces a tough task to overcome Clintons lead of 263 pledged delegates in the Democratic race, which awards all delegates proportionally to their vote totals in each state. After days of sparring over the date for their next debate, Clinton and Sanders have agreed to hold the event on April 14 in Brooklyn, New York.   Clinton reported on Monday that she had raised $29.5 million in March for the primary campaign, trailing the $44 million Sanders reported raising in March. Clintons campaign said she raised an additional $6.1 million for the Democratic National Committee and state parties. At a New York City event celebrating a hike in the state minimum wage to $15 an hour, Clinton noted Trump had said wages were too high. That drew boos from the crowd, which included a large number of labor union members. I dont know what the calculation is by Trump and others but Ill tell you this: They are selling Americans short, Clinton said. ",politicsNews,"April 4, 2016 ",1
Justice Department in civil rights probe of Arizona election ,"PHOENIX (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice has launched an investigation into the handling of last months presidential nominating contest in Arizonas most populous county, citing complaints of exceedingly long lines at polling places with high levels of minority voters. The Justice Departments civil rights division has asked Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, to provide detailed information that could help authorities determine whether the March 22 primary election violated federal law, including how the number and locations of polls were decided. The Justice Department made the request in a letter dated April 1. The letter followed a call for a federal probe by Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, immediately after the election, calling the vote a fiasco as he cited unacceptably disparate distribution of polling locations. In what officials called a cost-cutting move, Maricopa County slashed its polling sites to 60, down from 200 in 2012. Voters last month waited in line for up to five hours to cast ballots and well into the night at the sharply reduced number of polls.  In its letter, the Justice Department cites reports of a disproportional burden in waiting times ... in some areas with substantial racial or language minority populations. The Justice Department set an April 22 deadline for a response. Following the election, officials said their decisions on polling places were based on recent voting patterns and an increasing number of mail-in ballots. Karen Osborne, county elections director, denied there was any intent to rob voters of their rights and said officials would comply with the Justice Department request. This is a request for information, Osborne said in a brief interview on Monday with Reuters. We are going to gather the information, and we will get it together by the 22nd, and we will make it public. The state formally certified the election on Monday and candidates have five days to contest the results. In the Republican contest, Donald Trump won, while in the Democratic contest, Hillary Clinton won. An attorney for Democrat Bernie Sanders has said his campaign is considering a challenge.

"Behind Donald Trump, a son-in-law who is also an adviser","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Before introducing Donald Trump to roughly a dozen Republican lawmakers at the Washington law offices of Jones Day, U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions paused to acknowledge the man he said had facilitated the closed-door talks. He said it was Jared Kushner, a 35-year-old real estate investor and newspaper owner, who had suggested the get-together last month, arguing that it would enable Trump to win more allies on Capitol Hill, according to a person in the room.  Kushner is also Trumps son-in-law, having married the Republican presidential front-runners daughter Ivanka in 2009.  A real-estate tycoon like his father-in-law, Kushner has emerged as one of a very few advisers as Trump seeks the Republican nomination to the Nov. 8 election, according to five people close to Trump. It is especially rare given that Trump styles himself as his own best adviser and has said he consults only a few people despite a promise to hire the countrys top minds once he becomes president.  While well respected, Kushner has no official campaign role, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said. She confirmed however that Kushner had helped with the Sessions meeting and had informally advised the candidate on Israel and in other areas.  In an interview Kushners friend David Schulhof, founder of a music publishing company, cited a level-headedness and listening skill that would make Kushner a calming influence. This could be helpful to Trump, 69, who entered the race 10 months ago hailing his having never held public office as an asset, but whose campaign has been rocked by turbulence over remarks offensive to women, Muslims, immigrants, party loyalists and others. At times Kushner has urged Trump to behave like a more traditional candidate, stressing the importance of building relationships with politicians and traditionally active donors, say the sources close to Trump, speaking on condition of anonymity. They also say Kushner can use friendships like the ones he has with media mogul Rupert Murdoch and billionaire Ronald Perelman as a bridge to influential people with whom his father-in-law is not close. Neither Murdoch nor Perelman would comment for this story. An Orthodox Jew, whose wife Ivanka converted to Judaism before they married, Kushner and his family have connections to Israel. Along with his father, also a prominent real-estate developer, Kushner was listed in a 2015 report by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) as a benefactor for its real estate committee, which required a donation of at least $36,000 to the powerful pro-Israel lobbying group. Kushners parents donated $20 million two years ago to a medical school campus in Jerusalem now named after them.  Using his family and business ties, Kushner arranged a series of meetings for Trump during a trip the candidate planned to make to Israel last year, the sources say. The trip never happened. Trump scrapped it after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Trump later suggested that if elected he would not take sides in the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians, a stance he said would help him negotiate a peace deal but which was unusually neutral for an American politician looking to court voters on Israel.    Ahead of AIPACs annual conference last month in Washington, Kushner advised his father-in-law to lay out concrete policies that would help smooth over relations with the Jewish community, according to two sources. He further advised him to use a teleprompter for the speech, ditching his usual conversational style, the people close to Trump said.  It was also Kushner who fielded a call from Israels ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, who wanted to offer Trump the Israeli governments perspective ahead of the AIPAC speech, according to the sources. Dermers office declined to comment. In the end, Trump delivered an uncharacteristically detailed speech to the 18,000 people who attended the conference, outlining a series of policy positions broadly aligned with AIPACs. An AIPAC spokesman declined to comment. Trump told attendees that Palestinians must scrub hatred of Israel from their educational system and stop naming public places after people who attacked Israel. He said the United States must stand with Israel in rejecting attempts by the United Nations to impose restrictions on Israel or parameters for a peace deal. He criticized the U.S. deal with Iran as bad for Israel.  While helping Trump craft the speech, Kushner sought advice from the politically connected editor of his newspaper, the New York Observer. The editor, Ken Kurson, a former speech writer for former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, wrote in an email to Reuters that he reviewed the speech before Trump delivered it. Trump has loomed large in Kushners life since day one of his marriage. The New York Post reported that invitations to Kushners wedding, held at a Trump golf club in New Jersey, included a flier advertising Trumps other golf properties. Kushner, who with his wife has taken family vacations with News Corp (NWSA.O) owner Murdoch and his ex-wife Wendi Deng, has worked to calm Murdochs ire with Trump over the candidates criticism of the companys Fox News Channel and star anchor Megyn Kelly, two people familiar with his activities say. During regular phone calls and lunches Kushner tries both to soothe Murdoch and stump for his father-in-law, these people said.  Despite his influence behind the scenes, Kushner keeps a largely low profile on the campaign trail. During a Trump rally in South Carolina last November, he hung back while other family members took the stage until his father-in-law called him out. Wheres Jared? Jared get up here, Trump shouted. Kushner, clad in charcoal-colored pants and a black quilted down vest, shuffled up, hands jammed in his pockets. Jareds a very successful developer and he just loves politics now, Trump said, adding with a bit of gleeful teasing: Look at him. See the way he dresses?

Senate unanimously approves trade secrets bill,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Monday approved legislation to give companies greater legal protections for their commercial secrets and allow them for the first time to sue in federal court if they are stolen. The Defend Trade Secrets Act passed 87-0, amid strong White House backing. Supporters hope the unanimous vote will boost the bills prospects in the House of Representatives. Some thieves would rather not go through the trouble of developing products themselves; theyd rather just steal the fruits of others creativity, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in urging passage of a bill he argued would help protect American innovation. Theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets, costs U.S. businesses more than $300 billion a year, according to a 2013 report by the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, which was made up of a bipartisan group of high-ranking former U.S. officials.  For that reason, the bill has received support from a wide array of companies, including Boeing Co (BA.N) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), and trade groups such as the Biotechnology Industry Organization, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and a software lobby whose members include Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).   Trade secrets are confidential information that can give a business a commercial edge. They can vary widely depending on the industry, including manufacturing processes, formulas, computer algorithms, industrial designs, business strategies, and customer lists. Companies have become increasingly concerned about protecting themselves against threats, including hacking and rogue employees.  The legislation would give companies the right to sue in federal court to recover damages, enforce injunctions and prevent the further dissemination of stolen trade secrets.  It would also create a uniform standard for what constitutes trade secret theft. Currently, if companies want to sue, they are relegated to state courts, where there is a patchwork of state laws.  Trade secret theft is already a federal crime, but according to the bills sponsors, the U.S. Department of Justice lacks the resources to prosecute such crimes.   Some critics, including a group of legal scholars, has warned that broad legislation on trade secrets could lead to more frivolous litigation in federal courts. The House version of the bill has more than 120 sponsors, but the House Judiciary Committee has not yet considered it and it was not clear whether it would act in coming months.

U.S. to raise payments to insurers for Medicare Advantage 2017 plans,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government will pay U.S. health insurers who provide Medicare Advantage plans to elderly and disabled Americans about 0.85 percent more on average in 2017 than in 2016, reflecting mostly stable medical costs, a government agency said on Monday. The Department of Health and Human Services final plan to raise payments was a bit less than the 1.35 percent increase the agency proposed in February. It said the lower figure reflected revisions to medical services cost calculations. The Medicare Advantage rates look very much in line with the proposed rule, said Ipsita Smolinski of Capitol Street, a Washington research firm. Insurers including UnitedHealth Group Inc, Aetna Inc and Anthem Inc manage health benefits for more than 17 million Americans enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans. The other more than 30 million people eligible for Medicare coverage are part of the government-run fee-for-service program. Shares in UnitedHealth and Aetna were slightly lower in very light after-hours trading, while Anthem was unchanged. Each year, the government sets out how it will reimburse insurers for the healthcare services their members use. Payments vary by region, the quality rating earned by the health plan and the relative health of the members. The proposal is always subject to industry lobbying and often changes before it is finalized.  Analysts said that while that the lower-than-proposed payment was a slight negative for insurers, the agency made two other modifications in the final overall payment plan that would benefit the industry next year.  Capital Alpha Partners analyst Kim Monk said the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the health agency division that regulates Medicare, gave ground on two issues: a new method for calculating risk and cuts in payments for certain employer-based retiree drug plans. The government agency, which initially planned to implement the cuts over a year, said on Monday it now planned to introduce a two-year transition period after hearing from insurers, unions, employers and lobbying groups that the cuts proposed in February were too aggressive. Insurance lobbyist Americas Health Insurance Plans President Marilyn Tavenner said in a statement the government had made changes to mitigate the negative impact of its original proposal, but that more could be done to improve the stability of the employer-based retiree plans.

Republican Ryan is raising big money but not for White House race,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Overlooked in all the speculation about running for president, Republican Paul Ryan has quietly laid to rest doubts about his ability as a campaign fundraiser for congressional colleagues. Ryan has raised more than $9 million through his Team Ryan network since his first day as Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives on Oct. 30, 2015, through the end of January 2016, a Reuters review of U.S. Federal Election Commission filings showed. That haul helps House Republicans and party committees and compares with about $6 million raised by his predecessor John Boehner over the same three-month period in the 2014 campaign cycle and about $7 million in the 2012 presidential election cycle. Ryan has delivered at least $8 million to the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), a party group that backs congressional Republicans, again topping Boehner in 2014 and 2012, according to FEC filings through Feb. 29. That has helped put the NRCC in its best cash-on-hand position ever entering an election year, and placed it $2 million ahead of the rival Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.       Ill put it this way, Paul Ryan is a finance chairs dream in terms of fund-raising, said Representative Ann Wagner, the NRCCs finance chairman.      The uncertainty this election year about who will win both parties presidential nominations has also helped fundraising for congressional candidates, she said.                 Ryan has defied skeptics who doubted last year that he could match Boehner on the cash front and still fulfill a pledge to be at home with his family on weekends. In U.S. politics, the ability to fundraise is a key test of potential for higher office, but Ryan, who ran unsuccessfully for vice president in 2012, has consistently denied he is interested in entering the 2016 White House race.     Get my name out of it ... Im not that person, Ryan said on Monday, speaking from Israel, where he is on a congressional visit, in an interview with talk radio host Hugh Hewitt. Nonetheless Ryan is the center of speculation that he could emerge as a compromise nominee if the partys presidential nominating convention dissolves in chaos in July. Im not running for president ... End of story, Ryan said.     Despite his fundraising prowess, there are some signs of trouble ahead for Ryan. The mere mention of his name produced boos from supporters of Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump at a recent rally in Ryans home district. And a Wisconsin conservative has announced he will challenge Ryan in the Republican congressional primary election scheduled for August. On Capitol Hill, Ryan must also preserve a tentative peace he has achieved among warring Republican factions in the Congress. The first test will be to get Congress to pass a budget, and Ryan risks infuriating conservatives if he is forced to compromise with Democrats to avoid a government shutdown, as critics accused Boehner of doing.  The challenge for Ryan is similar to the challenge Boehner faced. The Republican base, at this point, really doesnt like its own leadership, said Kyle Kondik, a political analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. So just being speaker may eventually take a toll on Ryans popularity among Republicans, he said.     ",politicsNews,"April 4, 2016 ",1
New Jersey sues Atlantic City over school money,"(Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christies administration sued cash-strapped gambling hub Atlantic City on Monday, seeking to freeze city spending until it remits the millions of dollars it owes to its school district. In the civil action, State Education Commissioner David Hespe said Atlantic City owed the district $82 million of tax revenues collected for the school year. The city already paid $48 million of that, but must still remit the remaining $34 million by July 15, court documents showed. That might be impossible. As of April 1, the city had only $8 million of cash available for operations. Second-quarter tax collections that begin in May will not provide enough to fund required disbursements, the lawsuit said. Christie is seeking to stop the city from making its $3.2 million payroll on Friday, he said in a televised press conference. The state sued to protect the property tax collections that rightfully belong to the Atlantic City School District and the children and families they serve, Christie said. In New Jersey, cities must act as collection agents by collecting property taxes on behalf of school districts and  transmitting the money to them.  The lawsuit is the latest in Christies high-stakes game of chicken against city officials and some lawmakers over whether to take over the citys operations to avoid bankruptcy. Christie and state Senate leaders say city officials have not done enough to stop the bleeding. They supported a legislative package that links a full state takeover with one that would provide immediate revenue for the city. The nearly insolvent city has been under state oversight since 2011. Mayor Don Guardian threatened to close City Hall for three weeks beginning on Friday afternoon because it will not have enough money to pay workers after that. Christie twice vetoed - even after winning changes he sought - legislation aimed at stabilizing the citys tax base by letting casinos make fixed payments in lieu of property taxes. The citys state-approved budget relied on those revenues. In February, Christie pinned that legislation to the takeover measure, which Guardian initially supported but later called a fascist dictatorship. The package is now stalled in the state Assembly, where Speaker Vincent Prieto has refused to bring it to a vote because he says its goal is to dismantle collective bargaining agreements.  On Monday, Moodys Investors Service downgraded the city deeper into junk territory, to Caa3. ",politicsNews,"April 4, 2016 ",1
Virginia governor vetoes bill to label books 'sexually explicit' in schools,"RICHMOND, Va. (Reuters) - Virginias governor vetoed a bill on Monday that would have made the state the first in the country to require that parents be notified if students were assigned readings labeled sexually explicit.  A mothers objection to Toni Morrisons novel Beloved being taught in her sons classroom helped spur the legislation that would have given parents more control over classroom materials. This requirement lacks flexibility and would require the label of sexually explicit to apply to an artistic work based on a single scene, without further context, Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, said in a statement. The bill passed the Republican-controlled legislature by votes of 77-21 in the House of Delegates and 22-17 in the Senate. That would not be enough to override McAuliffes veto, which would require a two-thirds vote in each chamber. The measure would have made Virginia the first U.S. state to mandate that schools notify parents if teachers planned to use the labeled materials, according to the American Library Associations Office for Intellectual Freedom.  McAuliffe said the Virginia Board of Education was studying the issue, focusing on existing local policies and potential state policies. The measure had been opposed by a number of free speech groups, including the American Library Association and the National Coalition Against Censorship. The novel by Morrison, a Nobel laureate, is the story of a runaway slave who kills her 2-year-old daughter to save her from a life in slavery. Beloved won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1988. The American Library Association has it on a list of banned or challenged classics.  Virginia House Speaker William Howell, a Republican who was among the bills sponsors, said he was unaware of McAuliffes veto and had no reaction.  I have to see what his veto message said, he said.

Creditors sue to block Puerto Rico development bank withdrawals,"SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Creditors of Puerto Ricos Government Development Bank on Monday sued to stop it from distributing money to creditors in what they call preferential transfers ahead of the GDBs May 1 debt payment that Puerto Ricos governor says may not be payable. Hedge funds including Brigade Capital Management and Claren Road Asset Management, which hold some of GDBs $3.75 billion in debt, asked a federal court in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to bar municipalities, public entities and other depositors from removing their money, to prevent a run on the bank. The lawsuit is the latest sign of an increasingly urgent financial crisis in Puerto Rico, which has $70 billion in total debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and a shrinking population.  Puerto Ricos governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, has said the GDB is near insolvency, and is considering a moratorium on debt payments. The GDB has a payment due on May 1 of approximately $422 million. The island, as a whole, faces a July 1 payment of $1.55 billion on various debt classes. The GDB and its creditors are in the midst of restructuring talks that could lead to a forbearance agreement or debt restructuring. Mondays lawsuit was filed to give those talks time to evolve without a fear of a run on the bank, said Donald Bernstein, a lawyer for the creditors. GDB needs to be able to fund essential services, but to the extent money is being pulled out by people who want to bail out of the situation at the expense of other creditors, that shouldnt happen, Bernstein said in an interview. GDB acts as the commonwealths main liquidity source, with public agencies drawing on accounts to fund services and pay their own debt. GDP President Melba Acosta Febo said the central claim of the lawsuit, that the bank withheld financial information in order to prefer certain depositors over its bondholders, is false and not based in fact. Although the specific allegations set forth in the lawsuit are erroneous, it is clear that our creditors agree with us on one thing: Puerto Ricos fiscal situation is dismal, the Islands debt is unpayable, and the need for a federal restructuring regime to help the Commonwealth on the road to recovery is acute, Acosta said in a statement. A default at the GDB could allow creditors to seek the appointment of a receiver, a process that would be triggered by Puerto Ricos treasury secretary, Juan Zaragoza.  Zaragoza last week resigned his membership on GDBs board of directors, which a source close to the restructuring talks at GDB told Reuters was done to avoid a conflict of interest in the event he must appoint a receiver. The same source said the islands treasury department is not considering removing money from GDB, but is considering opening new accounts at other banks in the event GDB becomes insolvent.

Planning group puts $43 billion price tag on Illinois transportation fix,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Cash-strapped Illinois needs $43 billion over 10 years to repair and improve its transportation network and boost the state economy, according to a report released on Monday by the Metropolitan Planning Council. The $43 billion needed to rebuild and improve our transportation infrastructure is less than what were wasting today on vehicle repairs due to poor road conditions, time lost to traffic congestion, and population and jobs going to neighboring states, Jim Reilly, a senior fellow at the nonprofit, nonpartisan Chicago region planning group, said in a statement.  The fifth-largest U.S. state is in its 10th month without a full fiscal 2016 budget due to an impasse between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature. Illinois is struggling with a $6.7 billion bill backlog as pensions and debt payments gobble up a big chunk of available revenue. The report called for raising $2.7 billion a year by increasing the current 19 cents-a-gallon state gasoline tax by 30 cents and hiking vehicle registration fees, which cost $101 a year for most cars, by 50 percent. Half of the new money would be tapped for pay-as-you-go projects, with the other half backing $25 billion of 25-year bonds.  The money would be spent on state and local roads, mass transit and railroads. The council recommended an amendment to the Illinois Constitution creating a transportation trust fund to ensure the new revenue is not diverted for other purposes. ",politicsNews,"April 4, 2016 ",1
New York's Cuomo signs two-tier minimum wage law in push for state-wide $15/hour,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday signed into law a minimum wage increase that takes a two-tier approach, setting a higher $15 per hour minimum for New York City and its environs and a lower legal minimum for less-costly areas. Cuomo held a rally celebrating the event with Hilary Clinton, who is campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination in her home state before its April 19 primary. Democrats have rallied behind the $15 minimum wage ahead of the presidential election in November. This new economy is not a fair economy for the middle class and the working families of this country, Cuomo said at the signing in a New York City convention center. They feel that the American dream is slipping away. States and cities have moved to surpass the federal minimum wage, which has remained at $7.25 an hour since 2009. California Governor Jerry Brown on Monday also signed into law a plan to raise the minimum wage from $10 to $15 an hour by the year 2023, making the nations most-populous state among the first to boost pay to that level for the working poor. Clintons Democratic opponent for the nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, issued a statement from the campaign trail in Wisconsin praising both New York and California for pushing through the legislation. In New York, the minimum wage rises to $15 per hour from its current $9 by the end of 2018 for most businesses in New York City. Commuter counties of Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester will reach $15 by the end of 2021, while the rest of the state will reach $12.50 by the end of 2020. The two-tier approach was a compromise deal reached with the states Republican lawmakers, who said an increase to $15 in the poorer upstate areas in the north of the state would be unfair to business owners. After 2020 the $12.50 minimum wage upstate has the potential to rise by an amount determined by the state labor commissioner and the director of the budget. Any increase would be indexed to inflation and wage growth. New Yorks law also carves out a slow-lane for New York City business with up to 10 employees, giving them four years instead of three to implement $15 per hour. The law also contains a safety valve. From 2019, state budget officials will look at the effects of the wage increases on regional economies and determine whether they should continue or be suspended. In addition to the minimum wage law, Cuomo also signed a bill granting 12-week paid family leave that will phase in by 2021. ",politicsNews,"April 4, 2016 ",1
"Exclusive: Democrats Clinton, Sanders promise to include Latinos in cabinet","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders vowed to nominate Latinos into key cabinet posts in their administrations if elected, according to their answers to a questionnaire organized by the nations largest Latino coalition. The 20-question survey was submitted by the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda to all U.S. presidential candidates on Feb. 25, but received responses only from the two Democratic contenders and none from the Republicans, according to the results reviewed by Reuters. Latinos and African-Americans have emerged as key voting blocs in the Democratic race for the White House nomination so far, and are likely to play a large role in the outcomes of big contests looming in New York and California. From special assistants to cabinet members, Latinos will play a key role in helping to shape my policy priorities and be effectively represented in our agencies, former U.S. Secretary of State and Democratic front-runner Clinton wrote. U.S. Senator from Vermont Sanders promised to make his administration reflect the diverse make-up of the country... I can think of no place more vital for such diversity than in the cabinet and the Senior Executive Service of the President of the United States of America. President Barack Obama has nominated a number of Latinos to cabinet position during his time in office, two of whom are currently serving: Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro. Both Clinton and Sanders have already promised comprehensive immigration reform, appealing to Hispanic voters ahead of presidential nominating contests in minority-heavy states. Leading Republican hopefuls Donald Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, meanwhile, have promised to tighten up the borders and deport undocumented immigrants. The responses come as the Democratic contest for the partys presidential nomination is poised to roll into a slate of diverse states - including New York later this month and minority-heavy California in June.  The NHLA will use the questionnaires to guide voter engagement ahead of the November election, and to hold the winner to promises made during the campaign, said Hector Sanchez, the chairman of the NHLA. This is not just a piece of paper that were going to put out there, Sanchez said. If they want the Latino vote, they must engage with us. ",politicsNews,"April 4, 2016 ",1
Bernie Sanders' ghost tweeter keeps his Brooklyn accent,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Last August, Bernie Sanders sat on a Craigslist-bought beige couch in his Washington office plotting to steal the social media spotlight from 10 Republicans taking the stage for the first televised debate of the 2016 presidential campaign.  Next to the Democratic presidential candidate, 74, sat 27-year-old Hector Sigala, his digital media director. For the next two hours, Sigala turned Sanders sometimes acerbic, sometimes funny running commentary into a stream of 140-character tweets using the hashtag #DebateWithBernie that stole the show - at least on Twitter.  Some 17 million people were reached during the debate, according to the campaigns Twitter data reviewed by Reuters. It was the first in a string of Twitter wins by Sanders during a presidential contest widely viewed as a coming-of-age moment for social media in national politics. Sanders didnt even stop when the debate was interrupted by commercials. When an ad for a new Tom Hanks film appeared, he tweeted: Tom Hanks. Finally. Somebody who makes some sense.  Eight months later, Sigala is a key lieutenant in the Sanders campaign for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, one of a new breed of digital media specialists who have become indispensable in an election where platforms like Twitter allow candidates to communicate with supporters easily, bash opponents or swiftly counter-attack. Sigala goes everywhere  on dates, to parties and to restaurants  with his black backpack and MacBook laptop just in case something tweet-worthy breaks. He was driving his cousin to the airport last Wednesday when Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination, said women who end pregnancies should be punished if the United States bans abortion, comments that were widely condemned. Sigala pulled the car over and tweeted: Your Republican frontrunner, ladies and gentlemen. Shameful. Sanders has close to 2 million followers on his Twitter campaign account and has tweeted nearly 8,000 times. His opponent, Hillary Clinton, has tweeted less, 5,000 times, but she has nearly 6 million followers.  Sanders, however, has an edge because his tweets are much more personalized than Clintons, say some social media strategy experts. Hes been able to really resonate with (different groups) and connect with them on a level that many other candidates have not been able to do, said marketing consultant and social media strategy specialist Dr. Kay Green. While Twitter could not provide data directly comparing the 2016 and 2012 presidential races, a spokesman said tweets about the Democrat and Republican primary debates held so far have been viewed 9 billion times. On Facebook, the number of interactions (likes, posts, comments and shares) related to the 2016 election is up exponentially. Facebook users engaged in 411.5 million interactions on average in January and February, up nearly threefold from the nearly 142 million per month average for all of 2015.  The most obvious difference in the social conversations around the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections is, simply put, size, said Kellan Terry, an analyst with Brandwatch, a company that tracks and analyzes data from social media sites. The volume of social mentions around this years presidential election is massive.  Sigala and Sanders met in 2012 when he interned in Sanders Senate office in Vermont. Sanders, he says, bonded with him during a stroll down Church Street in Burlington, discussing a topic only Internet nerds could love: net neutrality.   Now, he manages both Sanders and his wife Janes social media accounts. In practice that means he is the person tweeting comments attributed to Sanders. On Twitter, I am Bernie Sanders, Sigala joked. Twitter tends to attract more millennials, who have largely backed the Brooklyn-born Vermont senator. The tweets and posts that get the best reaction are those that appear to be directly from Sanders mouth.  He used to come up with a lot of quips himself, Sigala said of Sanders, but the rigors of the 2016 campaign schedule mean Sigala is now often the one doing the tweeting.  Tweets about Sanders bread-and-butter issues like climate change, healthcare, race and gender typically roll off Sigalas fingertips in a tone and style that would be hard to distinguish from the senators.  Take, for example, a tweet from Sanders Twitter handle on March 18 in response to a debate over student tuition that was posted by Sigala in the first person:  Every public college and university in this country should be tuition-free. I know my opponent thinks its a radical idea, I dont, it said, taking a dig at Clinton.  But some news events require Sanders sign-off. On the day of the Brussels bomb attacks, in which 32 people were killed, Sigala had to wait hours before getting the go-ahead from a busy Sanders to post a condolence message. On a recent afternoon, Sigala was sitting in a Washington office posting messages to various social media sites while a college basketball game played on a nearby TV. When he isnt live-tweeting or reacting to breaking news, hes referring to a Microsoft Word document that contains 54 pages of prepared tweets on a list of issues.  When he took over the @BernieSanders Twitter account last May it had 50,000 followers. He would check it obsessively each day to see how many new followers it had attracted.  Now, with nearly 2 million followers, Sigala is less focused on the numbers and more interested in figuring out which tweets perform best.

Trump's prediction of 'massive recession' puzzles economists,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps prediction that the U.S. economy was on the verge of a very massive recession hit a wall of skepticism on Sunday from economists who questioned the Republican presidential front-runners calculations.   In an interview with the Washington Post published on Saturday, the billionaire businessman said a combination of high unemployment and an overvalued stock market had set the stage for another economic slump. He put real unemployment above 20 percent. Were not heading for a recession, massive or minor, and the unemployment rate is not 20 percent, said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York. The official unemployment rate has declined to 5 percent from a peak of 10 percent in October 2009, according to government statistics. But a different, broader measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment is at 9.8 percent. Coming off a difficult week of campaigning, in which he acknowledged he struggled to articulate his position on abortion among other missteps, Trumps comments to the Post might be some of his most bearish on the economy and financial markets.  I think were sitting on an economic bubble. A financial bubble, he said.  Some economists agree the stock market is in a period of overvaluation but do not see that as foretelling a cataclysmic economic downturn originating in the United States. Nobody can predict what the stock market is going to do, said Rajeev Dhawan, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University. I cannot predict a stock market crash, so I cannot predict a recession. I dont see any of the reasons for a recession going forward unless there is a huge problem with the market or there is some catastrophic world event which is beyond the scope of economics.  Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo, put the probability of an imminent recession at less than 10 percent. If it happens, it would be because of what is happening overseas, especially in China and Europe, he said. Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Pennsylvania, said it would take a total financial meltdown to trigger a recession. We can get by with Europe growing minimally, he said. We can get by with China growing modestly because the rest of the U.S. is still solid enough that we can handle weakness in the rest of the world. The Democratic National Committee criticized Trump for his remarks, saying they undermine our economy. Trumps success with voters, despite his sometimes saying things only to contradict them later, has also alarmed many leading figures within his own party. Some of them are openly plotting to try to prevent him from becoming the nominee at the partys national convention in July.     Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, said on Sunday that voters were afraid of their economic situation, when asked about Trumps remarks on CNNs State of the Union show. When people are afraid and when theyre angry, sometimes people say things that they regret, he said, apparently referring to Trumps remarks.  He also played down speculation that party leaders would  seek to dislodge Trump by helping someone who is not even a declared candidate prevail at the convention, which becomes governed by complicated voting rules if no candidate arrives with a clear majority. I think that our candidate is someone whos running, Priebus said, referring to Trump, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich. The candidates will next face voters on Tuesday in Wisconsin, where recent polls show Cruz holding a small lead over Trump. ",politicsNews,"April 3, 2016 ",1
Barron's endorses Kasich for president,"(Reuters) - Calling him the best hope for investors who want a Republican in the White House, Barrons announced its support for Ohio Governor John Kasich for president with a front-page editorial in its latest hard-copy edition. Barrons had previously endorsed Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton as a preferred choice over the current front-runner for the Republican Partys presidential nomination, Donald Trump, but in its editorial the weekly newspaper said that Kasich, outshines them both. Unlike Clinton, Kasich has a sensible across-the-board tax-cutting agenda for corporations, individuals, and investors, the editorial written by Barrons executive editor, John Kimelman, said. And as a Republican president working with a presumably GOP-controlled Congress, he would be a more effective leader. ",politicsNews,"April 3, 2016 ",1
"Clinton, Sanders audition for role as anti-Trump candidate","MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are tussling in Wisconsin over who would best represent the Democratic Party against Republican front-runner Donald Trump. The competition was in full force on Saturday night at the Wisconsin Democratic Partys Founders Day Gala, a chance for both Cliinton and Sanders to make their closing arguments before the states primary vote on Tuesday. Clinton, as the Democratic front-runner, is more and more taking aim at both Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the top Trump rival who is leading Wisconsin polls of Republican voters. Trump, in response to the threat of Islamic militants, has proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and Cruz has called for police patrols of Muslim neighborhoods. Clinton said these ideas are offensive. That does not make Trump and Cruz sound strong, said Clinton to the crowd of 1,400. It makes them sound in over their heads... You know loose cannons tend to misfire, and in a dangerous world that is a gamble we cannot afford. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who has been a surprisingly strong challenger to Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, told the crowd he would be a better opponent against Trump than Clinton. Sanders noted national poll numbers showing he leads Trump by a larger margin than Clinton leads the New York billionaire. Sanders said this makes him the strongest candidate on the Democratic side to go up against Trump. Its not just polling, Sanders said. There is one campaign which has created an enormous amount of excitement and enthusiasm and that is our campaign. For the Democratic Party to succeed in the Nov. 8 election, Sanders said, we need a vibrancy and energy that brings in young people who have flocked to his campaign. ",politicsNews,"April 3, 2016 ",1
Trump predicts 'very massive recession' in U.S. ,"MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump predicted that the United States is on course for a very massive recession, warning that a combination of high unemployment and an overvalued stock market had set the stage for another economic slump. I think were sitting on an economic bubble. A financial bubble, the billionaire businessman said in an interview with The Washington Post published on Saturday.  Coming off a tough week on the campaign trail in which he made a series of missteps, Trumps latest comments bring him back into the limelight ahead of Tuesdays important primary in Wisconsin where he trails in the polls. The former reality TV star said that the real U.S. jobless figure is much higher than five percent number released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Were not at 5 percent unemployment, Trump said. Were at a number thats probably into the twenties if you look at the real number, he said, adding that the official jobless figure is statistically devised to make politicians  and in particular presidents  look good.     Trump said its a terrible time right now to invest in the stock market, offering a more bleak view of the U.S. economy than that held by many mainstream economists. The interview was bylined by the Posts Robert Costa and famed Watergate reporter Bob Woodward.  A real estate magnate, Trump has made appealing to blue-collar workers a hallmark of his bid for the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election, often blaming unemployment on the outsourcing of U.S. jobs and facilities to countries such as China and Mexico. Trump vowed in the interview to wipe out the more than $19 trillion national debt over a period of eight years, helped by a renegotiation of trade deals. Im renegotiating all of our deals, the big trade deals that were doing so badly on, he said. After making controversial statements about abortion last week, Trump has shown little sign of heeding calls from fellow Republicans to adopt a more presidential tone so as to avoid alienating voters in the November general election if he wins the nomination. On Saturday, he questioned close U. S. ties to Saudi Arabia and again accused U.S. allies of not pulling their weight in the NATO military alliance.  Trump told a campaign rally in Racine, Wisconsin that partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are not paying their fair share and called the 28-nation alliance obsolete. Either they pay up, including for past deficiencies, or they have to get out. And if it breaks up NATO, it breaks up NATO, Trump said. Tuesdays Wisconsin nominating contest could be a turning point in the Republican race. Trump, 69, trails his leading rival, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, 45, of Texas in the state. A Cruz win would make it harder for Trump to reach the number of 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination before the Republican national convention in July. The winner will get to claim all of Wisconsins 42 delegates. ",politicsNews,"April 2, 2016 ",1
Trump threat to run as independent counterproductive: party chief,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus said on Sunday that Donald Trump is making it harder for himself to win the Republican presidential nomination by threatening to run as an independent if he is not treated fairly. In several television interviews, Priebus, who chairs the Republican National Committee, said candidates sometimes make such statements in hopes of gaining leverage over the party, but that it would not work. Those kinds of comments, I think, have consequences, Priebus said on ABCs This Week. And so when you make those kinds of comments and you want people to fall in line for you, it makes it more difficult.  ... And certainly, you know, if you were running for president of the Kiwanis Club or the Boy Scouts and you said you dont know if you like the Kiwanis or the Boy Scouts, I think that makes your challenge even greater to ultimately win those kinds of posts, he said. Its no different for the Republican Party. On Tuesday, Trump backed away from the loyalty pledge he signed in September promising to support the partys eventual nominee and not to run an independent campaign for the White House. The RNC pledge has unraveled as Trumps remaining rivals, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich, also indicated they were unlikely to observe the pledge if Trump was the nominee.   Priebus said candidates signed the loyalty pledge as part of a deal in which the RNC agreed to provide data about voters. We expect that when candidates make commitments, that they keep them, Priebus told Fox News Sunday. Trumps relationship with the RNC has been contentious at times. Talking to Fox News Sunday, he once again did not rule out running as an independent if he does not get the Republican nomination. Were going to have to see how I was treated, Trump said. I want to be treated fair. Priebus said that if one candidate gets the support of 1,237 delegates before the Republican convention opens in Cleveland in July, that candidate will win the partys presidential nomination. But if no one wins on the first ballot, delegates can switch their allegiances and they can vote for who they want, Priebus told ABC. Nonetheless, Priebus told CNN, the nominee is likely to be one of the three people now running and not someone like House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who some have speculated could be a dark-horse candidate - mainly because he doesnt want to do it. Priebus also cited some practical reasons that the nominee most likely would have to be Trump, Cruz or Kasich: That candidate would have to have a floor operation (in Cleveland) and an actual campaign going on to make that possible.

State Department says halts review of Clinton emails at FBI request,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has suspended plans for an internal review of whether classified information was properly handled in former Secretary of State Hillary Clintons emails at the request of the FBI, a spokeswoman said on Friday. Clinton, the front-runner in the race for the Democratic Party nomination in the Nov. 8 presidential election, has apologized for using a private email server for official business while in office from 2009 to 2013 and said she did nothing wrong. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing the arrangement. On Jan. 29, the State Department said 22 emails sent or received by Clinton had been upgraded to top secret at the request U.S. intelligence agencies and would not be made public as part of the release of thousands of Clintons emails. It said that none of the emails was marked classified when sent. At the time, the department also said it would conduct an internal review on whether the information in the emails was classified at the time it passed through Clintons private clintonemail.com account run on a server in her New York home. The State Department consulted the FBI about this in February, and in March the law enforcement agency asked the State Department to halt its inquiry. The FBI communicated to us that we should follow our standard practice, which is to put our internal review on hold while there is an ongoing law enforcement investigation , State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau told reporters.  The internal review is on hold, pending completion of the FBIs work, she added. Well reassess next steps after the FBIs work is complete. A U.S. State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the State Department had really only done administrative work on its review but had held off while waiting for a response from the FBI. It took a little bit of time for the FBI to respond to our request for advice and in the interim we did not pursue the review out of prudence, said the official, who declined further comment on the State Department review. The government forbids handling of classified information, which may or may not be marked that way, outside secure government-controlled channels, and sometimes prosecutes people who remove it from such channels. The government classifies information as top secret if it deems a leak could cause exceptionally grave damage to national security. Two judges have allowed a group suing for Clintons records to seek sworn testimony from officials. On Tuesday, one judge said there was evidence of government wrongdoing and bad faith over the arrangement.",politicsNews,"April 1, 2016 ",1
Obama to delay Spain visit until government is formed: foreign minister,"MADRID (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama will not visit Spain until its parties manage to form a government and end over 100 days of political deadlock, delaying a trip that had been under consideration for July. What (Obama) told me is lets see if we form a government, because he is keen to visit Spain, Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo told reporters after meeting Obama at a dinner on Friday night for a nuclear security summit. Margallo said Obama had been considering a trip in July, but given Spain could return to the polls the month before, the president would prefer to wait. George W.

"Obama: Trump doesn't know much about foreign policy, world","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Friday that Donald Trumps recent comments that South Korea and Japan should acquire nuclear weapons show the leading Republican presidential candidate is not well informed on international relations. Trump told The New York Times in an interview published on Sunday that he would consider letting the countries build their own nuclear weapons, rather than having them count on U.S. protection against North Korea and China. Obama has made no secret of his disdain for the billionaire businessman, and he continued that theme with his repudiation of Trumps pronouncements. What do the statements you mentioned tell us? Obama told reporters at a news conference at the conclusion of a nuclear security summit. They tell us that the person who made the statements doesnt know much about foreign policy or nuclear policy or the Korean peninsula, or the world generally. Obama said Trumps candidacy had come up as a topic with world leaders on the sidelines of the summit, and he lamented the state of the Republican race. Even ... those countries that are used to a carnival atmosphere in their own politics want sobriety and clarity when it comes to U.S. elections because they understand the president of the United States needs to know whats going on around the world, he said. Obama took apart Trumps positions point by point.  The U.S. alliance with Japan and South Korea was one of the cornerstones of Americas presence in the Asia Pacific region and had underwritten peace and prosperity there, he said.  The relationship had been a boon to U.S. commerce and influence in addition to preventing nuclear escalation and conflict, he added. You dont mess with that. It is an investment that rests on the sacrifices that our men and women made back in World War II when they were fighting throughout the Pacific, Obama said.

Former New York deputy secretary of state accused of perjury,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former New York deputy secretary of state was arraigned on Friday after being indicted this week on charges that he lied about paying restitution after being convicted in 2007 of defrauding the state, the U.S. Justice Department said. Joseph Strevell, 54, of Castleton, New York, served as deputy secretary of state of New York from 1997 to 1999. He faces five counts of perjury and one count of defaulting on a restitution obligation. The Justice Department has accused him of lying under oath about making monthly payments, as well as his contributions toward the purchase of a 138-acre horse farm in 2013 and his daughters wedding in 2014. Prosecutors said Strevell falsely testified that his mother and aunt paid most of a $75,440 down payment on a lease for the farm and that he paid a couple thousand dollars for the wedding, when in fact he contributed more than $30,000. Strevell was convicted in federal court of defrauding the state after he left the state department, which traditionally oversees official records, to serve as head of the state-funded Institute of Entrepreneurship. In 2009, he was ordered to pay $111,500 in restitution, and given guidelines to pay a minimum of $100 per month or 10 percent of his gross monthly earnings, whichever was greater. After his arraignment, Strevell was released from custody in Albany, New York pending a trial in U.S. District Court. Restitution is a mandatory obligation that no convicted felon should be able to walk away from, Richard Hartunian, U.S. attorney for the northern district of New York, said in a statement. Strevells attorney, Paul Evangelista, declined to comment on the case. ",politicsNews,"April 1, 2016 ",1
Hillary Clinton to propose $10 billion manufacturing investment,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Friday will propose a $10 billion investment in partnerships to encourage the growth of the U.S. manufacturing sector as part of a national push to discourage outsourcing in the industry. The proposal would work with a broader campaign to encourage companies to build and expand their U.S. manufacturing operations. Clinton is slated to roll out the proposal on Friday in Syracuse, New York, ahead of the states nominating contest on April 19. New York has long been a hub of the manufacturing industry, but suffered significant declines in the sector in recent years. From 2000-2008, upstate New York alone lost nearly 105,000 manufacturing jobs, according to the state government. Clinton maintains a lead in the state, which she represented in the U.S. Senate, over rival Bernie Sanders, a U.S. Senator from Vermont and a New York native.  Sanders was born and raised in New York Citys borough of Brooklyn. The Clinton campaign is headquartered there.  The campaign said the proposals multi-billion dollar price tag would largely be covered by Clintons proposed clawback tax, which would rescind tax relief for companies that outsource jobs or facilities abroad.

Trump's probability of winning nomination drops: PredictIt,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The probability that Republican front-runner Donald Trump will win his partys presidential nomination dropped sharply in the past week while the likelihood of a brokered convention to potentially choose another candidate rose, according to online predictions market PredictIt. Trumps probability of winning the nomination fell to 44 percent on Friday from 67 percent a week ago, according to the website, which is run by Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand. For Republican rival Ted Cruz, a U.S. Senator from Texas, it rose to 34 percent from 14 percent during the same period.  The probability that the Republicans will have a brokered convention to decide the nominee for the Nov. 8 election jumped to 69 percent from 43 percent a week ago, according to PredictIt, an online predictions market where users place money on who they think will win the election. Many users are from the United States.  Celebrity businessman Trump is facing pressure to take a more serious approach to his presidential campaign from supporters worried that a string of recent missteps and controversial comments may do lasting damage.    A Cruz win in Tuesdays primary in Wisconsin would make it harder for Trump to reach the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination before the Republican national convention in July.  If Trump does not win enough delegates, then the party faces the prospect of holding a contested, or brokered, convention in which party leaders try to negotiate nominating a compromise candidate.

Trump sued in Kentucky by three who say he incited crowd to violence,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - Three people who claim they were assaulted at a Donald Trump rally in Louisville, Kentucky, last month have filed a lawsuit against the Republican presidential candidate, saying he incited a riot. Molly Shah, Kashiya Nwanguma and Henry Brousseau filed the lawsuit on Thursday in Jefferson Circuit Court in Louisville, claiming that Trumps repeated calls of get them out at a rally at the Kentucky International Convention Center on March 1 was intended to direct his supporters to use unwanted, harmful physical force to remove protesters, including the plaintiffs. The lawsuit also names as defendants the Trump campaign and three individuals who the plaintiffs claim assaulted them at the rally. The three plaintiffs, all Louisville residents, claim they suffered physical injuries, emotional distress and humiliation, and are seeking unspecified damages, according to the lawsuit. Peaceful protest is an American tradition, especially in the context of presidential politics, Dan Canon, the attorney for the plaintiffs, told Reuters in a Twitter message. But what you see all over the country, time and time again, is violence employed against protesters at Trump campaign events. These plaintiffs are saying enough is enough,  The lawsuit said Trump stopped his 30-minute speech five times to point out protesters and, in most cases, told supporters to get em out of here, according to the lawsuit. A spokeswoman for Trumps campaign could not be reached for comment. The lawsuit claims that Trump incited a riot as defined under the Kentucky penal code. The individuals named as defendants are Matthew Heimbach, described in the complaint as a Trump supporter and Ohio resident who is affiliated with the Traditionalist Worker Party, a recognized hate group; Alvin Bamberger, 75, described as a Trump supporter and an Ohio resident; and an unknown female. According to the lawsuit, at the rally, Heimbach, who was wearing a Traditionalist Worker Party T-shirt, attacked Shah and Nwanguma. A spokesman for the Traditional Worker Party could not be reached. A website for the Traditionalist Worker Party describes it as a grassroots political organization that believes, among other things, that European-American identity is under constant attack. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a non-profit organization that monitors groups it considers extremist, classifies the Traditionalist Worker Party as a white nationalist hate group. According to the lawsuit, Nwanguma was assaulted by numerous protesters at the rally, of whom Heimbach and Bamberger were the most aggressive. Video of Nwanguma, a 21-year-old college student, being repeatedly pushed at the convention went viral after the rally, the lawsuit said. Bamberger could not be reached immediately for comment. The lawsuit also claims that Shah was assaulted by Heimbach and that Brousseau was assaulted by the unknown female defendant. ",politicsNews,"April 1, 2016 ",1
U.S. to unveil retirement advice rule next week: source,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Obama administration will release a long-awaited proposal on retirement advice on Wednesday, according to a person familiar with the matter. At an event at the Center for American Progress think tank, the U.S. government will unveil its proposed rule requiring brokers who provide retirement advice to follow a fiduciary standard of putting clients interests before their own.  The proposal aims to end potential conflicts of interest by brokers who advise on individual retirement accounts and to protect consumers from buying unnecessary investment products.  Required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, the rule has followed a tortuous path toward fruition. Financial companies and lawmakers have worried that the rules requirements could drive up costs and keep middle- and low-income people from being able to afford retirement services. The Labor Department, which regulates retirement plan advice, withdrew its initial proposal in 2011 after criticism from the financial services and insurance industries and leaders in both political parties. A new version was proposed a year ago after a nudge from President Barack Obama and discussions with the industry and lawmakers, who considered blocking funds needed for a standard. In January, the Labor Department finished work on the rule and sent it to the White Houses Office of Management and Budget for review. Even though the text was not released, both Washington and Wall Street have been preparing for a possible fight over the latest version. Last month, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it is prepared to sue the federal government if it finds the rule unworkable. The DOL has been very prudent about how theyve gone about this in trying to make their rule litigation-proof, but opponents will sue in court, said Scott Puritz, managing director of retirement services firm Rebalance IRA. Despite publicly opposing the rule, many money managers have privately been preparing for its release for several months. Firms including LPL Financial Holdings have been cutting fees and reducing the amounts clients can hold in their brokerage accounts, all in preparation for the rule. The advice Ive been giving broker-dealers and advisers is to get in front of the rule and explain it to clients now because after the rule is out, theyll sound defensive, said John Anderson who works with financial advisers at SEI Advisor Network, part of at SEI Investments Co..     The Labor Department and Center for American Progress did not respond to requests for comment. ",politicsNews,"April 1, 2016 ",1
Mississippi lawmakers approve religion bill amid gay-rights protests,"(Reuters) - A Mississippi measure that would allow people with religious objections to deny wedding services to same-sex couples and provide wide protections for actions decried as discriminatory by gay rights advocates passed the state legislature on Friday. Opponents plan a last-ditch attempt to stop the legislation on Monday before it heads to Mississippi Republican Governor Phil Bryant, whose spokesman said he would decide whether to sign or veto it after a thorough review. Bryant previously said he did not consider the bill discriminatory, according to WLOX television in Mississippi. The fight comes after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year legalizing same-sex marriage. In a wave of state-level legislation, social conservatives have pushed measures seen as harmful to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender men and women. A new law barring transgender people in North Carolina from choosing bathrooms consistent with their gender identity has drawn wide protest, while the governors of Georgia and Virginia vetoed similar religious liberty bills this week. Representative Andy Gipson, a Republican sponsor of the Mississippi measure, urged his colleagues on Friday not to be intimidated by national media criticism. He highlighted a poll that showed wide support for the measure in the state. Its time that we stand up and do the work of the people and protect the freedoms that they enjoy, he said. The bill includes provisions that go beyond same-sex marriages, according to the Human Rights Campaign, a national gay rights advocacy group that has labeled the act appalling. We urge Governor Bryant to do the right thing - reject discrimination, and veto this harmful measure when it reaches his desk, said HRC President Chad Griffin earlier this week.     The legislation would allow employers to cite religious conviction in determining workplace policies on dress code, grooming and bathroom and locker access.  Foster parents would be protected in placing lesbian, gay or transgender children into controversial programs seeking to change their sexual orientation, said Ben Needham, director of HRCs Project One America to expand lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights in the U.S. South.  He said the legislation could also permit discrimination against single mothers, for example, by religious-affiliated organizations such as homeless shelters and food pantries. Additionally, state court clerks could seek to be recused from providing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Some of Mississippis large employers, such as Nissan North America and MGM Resorts International, have spoken out against legislation that would discriminate.  ",politicsNews,"April 1, 2016 ",1

NY state reaches deal to raise minimum wage toward $15 an hour,"ALBANY, New York,  (Reuters) - Governor Andrew Cuomo and state legislative leaders reached a deal on Thursday to raise New York states minimum wage towards $15 per hour, but fell short of a uniform state-wide increase. The deal outlines a faster rise in New York City, but carves out a slow lane for small businesses and surrounding counties. In less prosperous areas north of the city it rises to $12.50 per hour before a state review of the laws impact. The minimum wage agreement was part of a broad budget deal that Cuomo announced late on Thursday. He said the plan included 12 weeks of paid family leave and $4.2 billion in tax cuts. The  $147 billion budget caps spending growth at 2 percent. I believe that this is the best plan the state has produced in decades, Cuomo told a news conference in the state capital, Albany. Cuomo has earmarked $100 billion in infrastructure spending in the state. The budget also increases school funding by 6.5 percent to $24.8 billion and freezes tuition at the state university system, SUNY.    The minimum wage has been a controversial element in difficult budget negotiations that threatened to delay the spending plan past the start of the states fiscal year on April 1. The agreement, including the minimum wage, still needs to get approval from lawmakers. Under the terms of the deal the minimum wage would rise from its current $9 per hour to $15 over three years in New York City starting on Dec. 31, 2016. City businesses with up to 10 employees would be given four years to implement the measure. Long Island and Westchester County around New York City would be given six years to push through the increases while the rest of the state would see the minimum wage rise to $12.50 in five years, with indexed increases to $15 possible after review.    There is also a provision to suspend the increases from 2019 if economic conditions worsen. The compromise is a climb down for Cuomo and his fellow Democrats who had pushed for a $15 state-wide minimum and no carve outs for small businesses. Republicans argued that a flat statewide rate could hurt businesses in less wealthy areas. It may not go to $15. Theres no guarantee, thats the good thing, said Senator George Amedore, a Republican representing a constituency upstate, who commented on the agreement to Reuters. Phil Steck, a Democratic Party assembly member, who represents a district 165 miles (265 km) north of the city, argued that the opposite was true, and a lower minimum wage would be a blow to the upstate economy. We have a very strapped economy in upstate New York and the surest way to ensure continued poverty is to run a low wage economy, he said. If anything, the poorer areas of the state needed an increase in the minimum wage more.   The multi-tier solution could also dampen the national drive  for a $15 minimum wage that has gathered pace as Democrats mobilize their base ahead of the presidential election in November. They hailed an important victory when California Governor Jerry Brown and legislators reached an agreement on Monday to raise the states minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2023. Cuomo said New Yorks calibrated path to raising the minimum wage could be an example for the rest of the county. It is raising the minimum wage in a way that is responsible and a positive for the overall economy, he said. ",politicsNews,"March 31, 2016 ",1

Senator Warren seeks investigation of insurers over retirement rule,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who advocates for strong financial regulation, asked U.S. securities regulators on Thursday to investigate comments made by major insurance companies about a forthcoming federal rule on retirement advice. Last month, Warren criticized Lincoln National, Jackson National Life Insurance Company, Prudential Financial and Transamerica, a unit of Aegon NV , for publicly stating that the rule requiring retirement advisers to put their clients interests ahead of their own would hurt business while privately telling investors it would not create a major hurdle. On Thursday, she went one step further and requested the Securities and Exchange Commission to formally look into whether the statements were contradictory and ran afoul of securities laws.  Both sets of industry claims - that the proposed rule will harm them and their business model, and that the proposed rule will not harm them and their business model - cannot possibly be true. And if one these public statements is materially false, it would appear to violate long-standing interpretations of our securities laws, she wrote to SEC Chair Mary Jo White. The White House will soon publicly release the latest version of the rule, drafted by the Labor Department. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform law called for holding brokers who give retirement advice to a strong fiduciary standard, meaning they must act in their clients best interest, as a way to protect retirees from buying unnecessary products that line brokers pockets. The Labor Department had to withdraw its initial version of the rule in 2011 after complaints from members of both political parties and the financial services industry. Warren says that financial and insurance companies have warned in public that the proposed rule could drive up costs and stop them from offering retirement services such as annuities to middle- and lower-income people. But in earnings calls they have reassured investors that they will come up with new products or approaches that will minimize threats to their businesses. Responding to Warrens critique last month, most of the insurers said their public warnings did not contradict reassurances to investors that they could withstand regulatory changes. They said their companies could navigate potential disruptions but they were still concerned about the consequences for consumers seeking retirement advice.  ",politicsNews,"April 1, 2016 ",1
Trump meets with Republican leadership; party unity discussed,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump made a surprise closed-door visit to the Republican National Committee on Thursday after a tumultuous two days on the campaign trail that included a reversal of his pledge to support the partys nominee. Trump, who is also struggling to contain the fallout from his Wednesday comment that women who have abortions should be punished if the procedure is outlawed, said afterward he had a nice meeting to talk about party unity with RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. Looking forward to bringing the party together, Trump said on Twitter. And it will happen! Priebus said the meeting was scheduled days ago and included a discussion about the process heading into the partys July convention in Cleveland. Trump leads the Republican race, but is at risk of falling short of the 1,237 delegates needed to become the partys nominee in the Nov. 8 election, raising the prospect of a contested convention. We did talk about unity and working together and making sure when we go to Cleveland, and come out of Cleveland, that were working in the same direction, Priebus told the Fox News Channel. Trumps relationship with the RNC has been contentious at times, and he recently complained the party was not treating him fairly as it prepared for a possible contested convention. On Tuesday, Trump backed away from the loyalty pledge he signed in September promising to support the partys eventual nominee and not to run an independent campaign for the White House. The RNC pledge has unraveled as Trumps remaining rivals, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich, also indicated they were unlikely to observe the pledge if Trump was the nominee. Priebus refused to say if the discarded loyalty pledge was discussed at the meeting with Trump, which lasted just under an hour. The billionaire businessman was in Washington for a morning gathering of his newly established foreign policy team. A source who attended said the group discussed threats from Islamic State militants, nuclear proliferation, homeland security assessments and European security levels. Trumps campaign also announced it was setting up a Washington office to run its convention and delegate operations and work with the RNC and Congress. The campaign has been busy trying to dig out from under an avalanche of criticism over Trumps abortion comment, even though he quickly reversed his stance. Trump pulled back from his initial comments within an hour, first in a statement saying that U.S. states should handle abortion issues and later saying doctors who perform abortions are the ones who should be held responsible. You have a presidential candidate that clarified the record not once but twice, Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson told CNN, calling the initial comments a simple misspeak. She said Trump was pro-life with exceptions and said his statements after the comments in an MSNBC interview were an accurate depiction of his views. We shouldnt make this a 24-hour headline when we have things like terrorism going on in the world. Trumps latest controversy threatened to further erode his standing with women voters, many of whom have been offended by his use of vulgarities and insulting language to describe women during the campaign. The abortion flap erupted as Trump campaigned in Wisconsin ahead of the states primary on Tuesday. The primary will be particularly important because all 42 delegates will be awarded to the winner of the popular vote, rather than distributed proportionate to the vote. Two opinion polls released in the last two days showed Cruz moving ahead of Trump by 10 percentage points in Wisconsin. Trumps meetings with his new foreign policy advisers follow several controversial statements on national security issues, prompting critics to question his suitability to be commander in chief. Trump has declared NATO obsolete, said Saudi Arabia is too dependent on the United States and said Japan and South Korea may need to develop their own nuclear programs because the U.S. security umbrella is too costly to maintain. In the same MSNBC town hall where he made the abortion comments, Trump refused to rule out the potential use of nuclear weapons in Europe or the Middle East to combat Islamic State militants. I would never take any of my cards off the table, he said. Trump told the Fox News Channel that the nuclear issue was discussed at his foreign policy meeting and everybody agrees with me. You dont take it off the table. Many establishment Republicans have labored to block Trump from getting the nomination at the July convention, worried that he will lead the party to an overwhelming defeat in November. Trumps Republican rivals said his abortion comments were just another example that raises questions about his suitability for the White House. It just shows that hes really not prepared to be president of the United States, Kasich told reporters at a New York news conference, adding that the president should not be constantly rowing back on a series of wild-eyed suggestions.  I have to tell you that as commander in chief and leader of the free world, you dont get do-overs. You need to be able to get it right the first time, he said. ",politicsNews,"March 31, 2016 ",1
Conservatives push for nearly unthinkable death penalty ban," AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A former gun industry lobbyist and budget-hawk Republicans are leading what might seem to be an unlikely hard-right campaign - trying to sway conservatives in places like Utah and Kansas that they should be the first Republican-held state in four decades to ban the death penalty.  The push from the political advocacy group Conservatives Concerned about the Death Penalty and lawmakers in places such as Nebraska would have been unthinkable a few years ago when it would have been conservative heresy to end capital punishment, a program seen as bedrock issue of the law-and-order policies embraced by the party.  But those leading the campaign say the death penalty is a costly, inefficient and heavily bureaucratic program that runs counter to their core conservative values of limited government.  This is not an issue just for bleeding heart liberals. This is an issue that pragmatic conservatives are getting on board with, said Marc Hyden, a coordinator of Conservatives Concerned about the Death Penalty, a network of political and social conservatives who say capital punishment does not align with their values.  Republican support for the death penalty remains strong at 76 percent in 2014, but that number is down from 85 percent in 1994, according to Gallup.  The conservative push against the death penalty is in its early phase but has led lawmakers in Nebraska last year to be the first Republican-dominated state in more than 40 years to approve an execution ban. The measure now needs approval from voters in November to take effect. In March, lawmakers in red-state Utah came close to passing a similar ban.  This is a bipartisan issue that anyone can get on board with, said Hyden, who served as a campaign field representative for the National Rifle Association.  The death penalty is legal in 31 U.S. states. But executions have been on the decline for years, in part due to court battles and a scramble to secure execution drugs after a sales ban a few years ago imposed by mostly European manufacturers who said it was immoral for their products to be used to kill inmates.  Hydens group is expanding its efforts in Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina and Washington to build bipartisan support in legislatures where rancor between parties has stymied scores of other bills.  But despite the momentum with conservative lawmakers, gaining support among the public in Republican-controlled states may be a hurdle too high.  A death penalty repeal bill in Missouri, which has executed 86 people since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, was placed on this years informal calendar, a wasteland for legislation without the votes to pass.  In red-state Utah, which has nine men on death row, the Republican-led bill to end the death penalty cleared the Senate and a House committee before dying without obtaining a vote. It likely will come up again in a session next year.  Utah State Senator Steve Urquhart, a Republican, said he won supporters among Senate colleagues by highlighting capital punishments high costs, lengthy appeals and exonerations in other states, which underlined its fallibility.  The death penalty makes absolutely no sense in 2016, he said in an interview. It costs an awful lot of money to execute a prisoner compared to holding that prisoner in jail for the rest of his or her life.  A state study found that Utah pays about $1.7 million more to fund items such as appeals, public defenders and carrying out executions for death penalty convictions than it would to incarcerate the same inmate for life.  But advocates of capital punishment balk at the idea that expense should be a factor when deciding punishment for the gravest crimes.  The death penalty should not be a utilitarian issue in terms of weighing the costs against the benefits but rather an issue simply of justice, of who deserves it, said Robert Blecker, a professor at New York Law School.  The six states before Nebraska to abolish the death penalty since 2007 have been left-leaning or left-center Maryland, Connecticut, Illinois, New Mexico, New Jersey and New York.

Republicans alarmed at talk U.S. may ease Iran trade,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican lawmakers voiced deep concern on Thursday about reports that the Obama administration might allow Iran to use the dollar in some business transactions, although no such plans have been announced. U.S. government officials said the issue is being discussed in the Treasury Department, but any policy change would not involve widespread access for Iran to the U.S. financial system, disputing media reports suggesting otherwise. The Obama administration is consideringeasing some sanctions to permit non-U.S. companies to have some access to the U.S. financial system for U.S. dollar transactions involving Iran, said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said the matter was being studied, no decisions had been taken and that, to the officials knowledge, none were imminent. The underlying reason for weighing the step is that non-U.S. companies now able to do business with Iran because of last years nuclear deal find it is difficult to do so without at some point touching the U.S. financial system. The official said such companies are getting conflicting messages from their own governments, which encourage trade with Iran, and from Washington, which emphasizes that it will enforce sanctions rigorously. Republicans remain dead set against any effort to ease restrictions against Tehran, especially in light of Irans recent missile tests. As Iran continues to undermine the spirit of itsnuclear agreement with illicit ballistic missile tests, the Obama administration is going out of its way to help Tehran reopen for business. The president should abandon this idea, said Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives. The controversy could complicate Senate confirmation of Adam Szubin to head Treasurys sanctions enforcement arm, Senate aides said. President Barack Obama nominated Szubin in April 2015, but he was not approved in committee until this month. Senate leaders tried to bring Szubin up for a vote in the full Senate a few days later, but at least one senator objected, the aides said. Republicans, who control Congress, tried to kill the international deal in which Iran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Some Republicans said they opposed Szubin because of his support for the agreement, and aides said talk of easing dollar restrictions could fuel their opposition. Deal opponents have seized on comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew as a sign that the administration would end a ban on Irans use of the dollar for trade. Republican Representative Ed Royce said in a letter to Obama that Lew appeared in House testimony last week to leave the door open to the administration allowing such transactions. Lew said the department was looking at how to make sure Iran gets relief under the nuclear deal, rather than denying the idea was under consideration. Current U.S. policy bars foreign banks from clearing dollar-based transactions with Iran through U.S. banks. Sanctions experts said Treasury could issue a license allowing U.S. banks to send dollars to an offshore facility, from which foreign, non-Iranian banks could withdraw dollars to facilitate legal trade with Iran. Any allowance would likely bar trade involving blacklisted Iranian citizens or organizations. The Associated Press reported that the Obama administration might soon tell foreign governments and banks they could start using the dollar in some instances to facilitate business with Iran, citing officials familiar with the discussions. Sources in the administration and Congress told Reuters such a concession was just one of a wide array of options that might be considered. State Department spokesman John Kirby commented that Washington would continue to analyze the lifting of sanctions under the nuclear agreement, known as the JCPOA, while keeping pressure on Iran on other areas of concern. As long as Iran continues to meet its nuclear commitments, we will continue to meet our JCPOA commitments for sanctions lifting, he said. ",politicsNews,"March 31, 2016 ",1
California lawmakers approve hiking minimum wage to $15,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - A plan to raise Californias minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022 passed both houses of the state legislature on Thursday, putting the state on track to become the first in the nation to commit to such a large pay hike for the working poor. The measure, incorporating a deal Governor Jerry Brown reached with labor leaders and progressive Democrats in the Legislature, was approved in the state Senate Thursday afternoon after winning approval earlier in the day in the Assembly, and now goes to Brown for his signature. If you work full time, your family shouldnt live in poverty, Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, a Southern California Democrat, said in support of the bill to raise the states minimum wage from its current level of $10 per hour. Lawmakers from the states poorer regions said the measure could harm small businesses that are barely hanging on amid double-digit unemployment, ultimately leading to job losses. If enacted, the bill would put California, home to one of the worlds biggest economies, among a growing number of U.S. states and cities that have moved in recent years to surpass the federal minimum wage, which has remained at $7.25 an hour since 2009. A proposal to raise the minimum wage in parts of New York state to $15 was announced Thursday by Governor Andrew Cuomo and legislative leaders. The California measure would gradually raise the states hourly minimum wage to $15 by 2022 for large businesses and by 2023 for smaller firms. The measure would also head off two competing ballot initiatives lacking a provision to allow the governor to suspend increases in hard economic times, a deal breaker for Brown. The proposal sped through the legislative process after the governors office reached a deal last week with labor unions pushing a similar minimum wage hike in the form of two ballot initiatives. With polls showing strong support for those measures at the ballot box, Brown emphasized that a version passed through the legislature would allow lawmakers to amend it if needed over time instead of going back to voters to request amendments in expensive and uncertain campaigns. Moreover, the deal allows the state to opt out of minimum wage increases if the economy is doing poorly, a provision not in either of the union-backed ballot initiatives. Even so, several moderate Democrats and most Republicans complained that it was being rushed through, and would disproportionately harm businesses in poorer parts of the state, where the cost of living is not high enough to warrant such a dramatic wage hike. The deal reached in New York would raise wages in costly New York City to $15 in three years, but would stagger increases in other parts of the state, some to just $12.50 per hour unless further approval is granted. It still must pass the legislature, where negotiations on the details are ongoing. ",politicsNews,"March 31, 2016 ",1
Michigan governor tells credit rating agencies state doing 'very well',"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Michigan Governor Rick Snyder has met with Wall Street credit rating agencies this week, telling them Michigans economy is doing very well in the face of a lowered credit outlook, Snyder said on Thursday.  We had a good, healthy discussion, Snyder told Reuters after speaking at a CUNY Graduate School of Journalism event in New York City. Michigan economically is doing very well. Two weeks ago, just before Michigans most recent bond offering, Standard & Poors Ratings Services lowered the outlook on Michigans credit rating to stable from positive. It cited burgeoning costs associated with a lead-tainted water crisis in the city of Flint and with the cash-strapped Detroit Public Schools (DPS).  Those rising expenses will limit the states ability to build reserves over the nest two fiscal years, S&P analyst Carol Spain said on March 17. Despite the outlook change, Michigan was able to sell about $82 billion of general obligation bonds with a true interest cost of 1.54 percent, showing little sign that the U.S. municipal bond market wanted to punish the state with exorbitantly high interest rates. One encouraging economic sign in Michigan is the 4.8 percent unemployment rate reported in February versus the national jobless rate of 4.9 percent. Snyder said it was a good time to meet with credit rating agencies because the state is not currently in the market. He tries to do it at least once a year.  ",politicsNews,"March 31, 2016 ",1
Trump in unexpected meeting with Republican Party chairman ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump took a detour from the campaign trail on Thursday and held an unexpected meeting in Washington with Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee. It was not immediately clear what the two men discussed but the meeting came after months of tension between Trump and the party he seeks to represent in the Nov. 8 election. Trump this week abandoned a pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee if it is not him. He has also complained about the partys delegate allocation process as he seeks to win the 1,237 delegates necessary for the nomination. Just had a very nice meeting with @Reince Priebus and the @GOP. Looking forward to bringing the Party together - and it will happen! Trump wrote on Twitter.  Barry Bennett, an adviser to the Trump campaign, said on MSNBC that the meeting was about Trump helping the RNC raise money. The meeting is to help the RNC, he said. Trump also met with his foreign policy team in the capital on Thursday after a series of statements by the billionaire businessman on national security issues that have drawn criticism.     In recent interviews, Trump has declared the NATO alliance obsolete, described Saudi Arabia as too dependent on the United States and said Japan and South Korea may need to develop their own nuclear programs because the U.S. security umbrella is too costly to maintain. In an MSNBC town hall on Wednesday night, Trump did not rule out the potential use of nuclear weapons in Europe or the Middle East to combat Islamic State militants. I would never take any of my cards off the table, he said. Max Boot, a conservative national security expert and member of the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in Commentary Magazine this week that Trump is singularly unqualified to be commander-in-chief. With Trump in command, our enemies would have a field day  Moscow and Beijing must be licking their chops at his desire to abandon U.S. allies in Europe and Asia  and our friends would face mortal threats. If that isnt the single biggest threat to U.S. security, I dont know what is, Boot wrote.         ",politicsNews,"March 31, 2016 ",1

Trump sounds off on abortion; criticism comes from all sides,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said on Wednesday that women who end pregnancies should face punishment if the United States bans abortion, triggering a torrent of criticism from both sides of the abortion debate, including from his White House rivals. After MSNBC broadcast a clip of an interview with Trump, the billionaire businessman rowed back his remarks, first saying that the abortion issue should be handled by states and later that doctors who performed abortions should be the ones held responsible.  The doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman, Trump said in his last statement. The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. Trumps earlier statements drew heavy fire from abortion rights supporters and opponents alike. Abortion has long been a divisive issue in American politics, even though the procedure was legalized in a Supreme Court ruling more than 40 years ago. Opposition to abortion has become a central plank in the platform of most conservative politicians.  Trump has won support from Republican voters for selling himself as a Washington outsider. But the New York real estate tycoon, who once supported abortion access, has come under pressure from conservatives to prove he is truly one of them. At the same time, he has drawn criticism for comments that offended women and minority groups. Of course, women shouldnt be punished, rival Republican candidate John Kasich said on Wednesday, saying he opposed abortion except in specific cases such as rape.  U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the third candidate for the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election, said Trump had not thought through the issue. Whats far too often neglected is that being pro-life is not simply about the unborn child, its also about the mother, he said in a statement. Abortion rights supporters were equally incensed. What Donald Trump said was outrageous and dangerous. Im constantly taken aback at the kinds of things that he advocates for, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton told MSNBC. Once again, he has showed us who he is. Dawn Laguens of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the political arm of the womens health group, called Trump flat-out dangerous in a statement. Abortion was legalized in the United States in 1973, when the Supreme Court declared that a womans constitutional right to privacy protected her decision to end a pregnancy.  In the decades since, there have not been enough votes on the Supreme Court to reverse the ruling, but numerous states have passed laws aimed at restricting abortion. In the MSNBC interview, which is to air in full later on Wednesday, Trump said if the United States banned abortion, some women would seek to end pregnancies illegally. There has to be some form of punishment, he said. Asked what form he would advocate, Trump said: That I dont know. Anti-abortion groups said Trumps comments were at odds with their own stance. In all the positions the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has taken around the issue of abortion, they have not called for punishment of women whove had abortions, said Don Clemmer, a spokesman for the group. After the backlash started, Trumps campaign sought to moderate his view. This issue is unclear and should be put back into the states for determination, Trump said in a statement provided to Reuters by email. Later, Trump walked back his comments further to say doctors, not women, should be responsible. The dust-up was evidence of further discord among Republicans over Trumps candidacy. On Tuesday, both Trump and Kasich, the Ohio governor, abandoned pledges to support the partys eventual nominee. Cruz did not explicitly abandon the pledge but said Trump would not be the nominee. Trump had already outraged many women after he said Fox News Megyn Kelly had blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever when she asked tough questions in a televised debate, which many saw as a reference to menstruation. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll in March, 66 percent of all likely women voters said they had an unfavorable view of Trump. But among the 460 Republican women who responded to the poll, 62 percent had a favorable view of him, while 38 percent did not. In other remarks that have set off furious reactions, Trump has called illegal immigrants from Mexico criminals and rapists and has pushed for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States.  In Wednesdays MSNBC interview, Trump said he would not rule out the possibility of using nuclear weapons to combat Islamic State militants. I would never take any of my cards off the table, he said.     ",politicsNews,"March 30, 2016 ",1
Nuclear terrorism fears loom over Obama's final atomic summit,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Just as fears of nuclear terrorism are rising, U.S. President Barack Obamas drive to lock down vulnerable atomic materials worldwide seems to have lost momentum and could slow further. With less than 10 months left in office to follow through on one of his signature foreign policy initiatives, Obama will convene leaders from more than 50 countries in Washington this week for his fourth and final Nuclear Security Summit, a high-level diplomatic process that started and will end on his watch. A boycott by Russian President Vladimir Putin, apparently unwilling to join in a U.S.-dominated gathering at a time of increased tensions between Washington and Moscow, adds to doubts that the meeting will yield major results. The recent deadly militant attacks in Brussels have fueled concern that Islamic State could eventually target nuclear plants and develop radioactive dirty bombs, a topic that may well be uppermost in leaders minds as they meet. Despite significant progress by Obama in persuading dozens of countries to rid themselves of bomb-making materials or reduce and safeguard stockpiles, much of the worlds plutonium and enriched uranium remains vulnerable to theft. The absence of Russia, one of the biggest atomic powers, could detract from decisions reached in Washington this week. Obama, in an opinion piece in The Washington Post, said, Our massive Cold War nuclear arsenal is poorly suited to todays threats. The United States and Russia - which together hold more than 90 percent of the worlds nuclear weapons - should negotiate to reduce our stockpiles further. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday Russia was skipping the summit because of a shortage of mutual cooperation in working out the agenda. While noting that Moscow had continued joint work on nuclear security, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Russia was going to miss out on an opportunity and that its no-show  illustrated the degree to which Russia is isolated. Russia has chafed over U.S.-led sanctions over the Ukraine conflict. Efforts to make the world safer have also been complicated by North Koreas nuclear weapons advance and Pakistans move toward smaller, tactical nuclear weapons, which Washington fears may further destabilize an already volatile region. All of this weighs on Obamas agenda as he prepares to host world leaders on Thursday and Friday. He inaugurated the event nearly six years ago, after using a landmark speech in Prague in 2009 to lay out the goal of ridding the world of nuclear weapons as a central theme of his presidency. There is no guarantee that once Obama, the driving force behind the initiative, leaves office in January his successor will keep the issue a high priority. The White House previewed the summit by touting a list of achievements in the U.S.-led effort to tie down loose bomb-grade materials, and arms control advocates commend Obama for galvanizing an international response to the problem. However, many say progress has slowed since the last summit in 2014 and countries such as Japan, India and Pakistan are preparing activities that could increase stockpiles of nuclear materials. The Nuclear Security Summits have had a positive effect, but the strategic goal of developing an effective global nuclear security system remains unachieved, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, an anti-proliferation watchdog, said in a report this month. According to the groups Nuclear Security Index, which tracks the safety of weapons-usable nuclear materials, the past two years have brought no improvement in a range of measures, including on-site physical protection, security during transport and the ability to recover lost radioactive materials. The report also said many countries nuclear reactors were vulnerable to online attacks. Seven of 24 countries with weapons-grade material, including China and Belgium, received the lowest possible score for their facilities cyber security. Other critics point to a lack of an agreed-upon set of international standards for nuclear security or a mechanism for keeping tabs on common sources of radioactive material often found in hospitals and medical labs. However, Laura Holgate, Obamas adviser on weapons of mass destruction, cited commitments from 30 countries at the 2014 summit to secure their most dangerous material.  The international community has made it harder than ever for terrorists to acquire nuclear weapons, and that has made us all more secure, she told reporters before the summit.   Two of the Brussels suicide bombers secretly filmed the daily routine of the head of Belgiums nuclear research and development program and considered an attack on a nuclear site in the country, according to Belgian media. U.S. experts are less concerned about militants obtaining nuclear weapon components than about thefts of ingredients for a low-tech dirty bomb that would use conventional explosives to disperse radioactive material and sow panic. U.S. officials said they had no doubt that Islamic State, which controls swaths of Syria and Iraq, was interested in obtaining such materials, but Holgate said U.S. authorities had no explicit indications that the group had tried to do so. More commitments from world leaders to enhance nuclear security are expected at the summit but anti-proliferation groups worry that without further meetings at the highest levels, interest could wane and improvements could backslide.

Pentagon to send about a dozen Guantanamo inmates to other countries soon,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon plans to transfer about a dozen inmates of the Guantanamo military prison to at least two countries that have agreed to take them, a U.S. official said on Wednesday, the latest move in President Barack Obamas final push to close the facility. The first of the transfers are expected in the next few days and the others will take place in coming weeks, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Among them will be Tariq Ba Odah, a Yemeni man who has been on a long-term hunger strike and has lost about half of his body weight. There are now 91 prisoners at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  Most have been held without charge or trial for more than a decade, drawing international condemnation. Obama, who last month presented Congress with a blueprint for closing the prison, is seeking to make good on his long-time pledge before he leaves office in January. But he faces stiff opposition from many Republican lawmakers, as well as some of his fellow Democrats. The Pentagon has notified Congress of its latest planned  transfers from among the 37 detainees already cleared to be sent to their homelands or other countries, the official said. U.S. officials have said they expect to move out all members of that group by this summer. Obamas plan for shuttering the facility calls for bringing the several dozen remaining prisoners to maximum-security prison in the United States. But U.S. law bars such transfers to the mainland, and Obama has not ruled out doing so by use of executive action. I do not have a timeline on when particular detainees will be transferred from Guantanamo, Commander Gary Ross, a Defense Department spokesman, said in a statement. However, the administration is committed to reducing the detainee population and to closing the detention facility responsibly. The most prominent of those to be resettled over the next several weeks is Bah Odah, a 37-year-old Yemeni who has been force-fed by nasal tube since he stopped eating solid food in 2007.  His weight had dropped to 74 pounds from 148 and his legal team feared he could die of starvation, according to an account in a Reuters report at the end of December. Lawyers for Ba Odah, who was cleared for transfer in 2009, had tried unsuccessfully to win his release on health and humanitarian grounds, but Pentagon officials said he was receiving proper care. The plan to resettle about a dozen inmates was first reported by the Washington Post. The U.S. official declined to name the countries ready to take them in. Ten Yemeni men were sent to Oman in January. Others were recently sent to Ghana, Bosnia and Montenegro. The Obama administration has ruled out sending Yemenis, who make up the bulk of the remaining prisoners, to their homeland because it is engulfed in civil war and has an active Al Qaeda branch. Guantanamo prisoners were rounded up overseas when the United States became embroiled in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. The facility, opened by Obamas predecessor George W. Bush, came to symbolize aggressive detention practices that opened the United States to accusations of torture.

Senator Wyden pledges to fight limits on encryption,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Ron Wyden pledged on Wednesday to fight legislation expected shortly in Congress that would limit encryption protection in American technology products. The proposal by Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, would give federal judges authority to order technology companies to help law enforcement officials access encrypted data, according to sources familiar with the situation. I believe weakening strong encryption puts at risk millions of Americans, families and communities from one end of the country to another, Wyden told Reuters after his speech at the RightsCon digital rights conference in San Francisco. This issue is as important as any that Ive been involved in in my 15 years in the intelligence committee. Asked if he would put a hold on the expected legislation, the Oregon Democrat, who is a leading privacy advocate, said: I would do anything within my power as a United States senator to block any plan that weakens strong encryption. His remarks followed a high-stakes confrontation between the U.S. Justice Department and Apple over a court order that the company provide access to an iPhone used by one of the assailants in a deadly shooting rampage last December in San Bernardino, California. The government said on Monday it unlocked the phone without Apples help and dropped its legal action. Apple and other technology companies strongly opposed the court order, saying anything that helps authorities bypass the security features of tech products will undermine security for everyone. Government officials have insisted that criminal investigations could be crippled without access to phone data, and both sides are gearing up for a fight in Congress. Wyden said he would revive a 2014 bill he introduced to block court attempts by U.S. law enforcement to undercut encryption as in the Apple case. Without such a measure, he said the FBI would try again to get a precedent allowing it to compel companies to hack their customers as sure as night follows day.

Nuclear security measure to take effect in 'near future': IAEA head,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Only six more nations need to ratify an amendment to a nuclear security convention that would make it legally binding for countries to tighten protection of nuclear facilities and materials, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Wednesday. IAEA Director Yukiya Amano told reporters that the measure  should take effect in the near future after Serbia and the Marshall Islands formally ratified it on Wednesday and more countries were expected to submit paperwork on Thursday or Friday. It was not immediately clear which countries they were. Amano, in Washington for President Barack Obamas fourth and final Nuclear Security Summit this week, said the ratification would be a very important step up ... in nuclear security. Pakistan ratified the amendment last week. Entry into force would reduce the likelihood of terrorists being able to detonate a radioactive dispersal device, otherwise known as a dirty bomb, Amano said in a speech in Washington earlier Wednesday. Amano has pressed hard to advance the amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, which was adopted by 152 member countries a decade ago. Two thirds of the members, or 102 countries, must ratify the long-delayed measure for it to take effect. The amendment makes it legally binding for countries to protect nuclear facilities, as well as the domestic use, storage and transportation of nuclear material. It provides for expanded cooperation among countries on finding and recovering stolen or smuggled nuclear material. States would be required to minimize any radiological consequences of sabotage, and to prevent and combat any such offenses. Amano said that more work was needed in making the amendment   universal, which would help ensure that all countries with nuclear capabilities - including North Korea - adhered to the measure, not just those countries that had ratified the measure. The IAEA director said he favored organizing a separate conference to review the amendment once it took effect.   ",politicsNews,"March 30, 2016 ",1

Plan to raise California minimum wage to $15 clears key panel,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - A plan to raise Californias minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022 cleared its first legislative hurdle on Wednesday, putting the state on track to become the first in the nation to commit to such a large pay hike for the working poor. The measure, incorporating a deal Governor Jerry Brown reached with labor leaders and fellow Democrats in the Legislature, was approved on a party-line vote of 12-7 by the Assembly Appropriations Committee, where a previous version of the bill had stalled last summer. One Democrat, Tom Daly, joined six Republicans in opposing the measure, which now advances to the full Assembly for action as early as this week. It would then return to the Senate for a final vote. If enacted, the bill would put California, home to one of the worlds biggest economies, in the vanguard of a growing number of U.S. states and cities that have moved in recent years to surpass the federal minimum wage, which has remained at $7.25 an hour since 2009. Supporters say such measures are necessary to help low-paid workers who have been slipping into poverty due to stagnant earnings and rising living expenses. Opponents say raising the mandatory wage floor puts undue strain on businesses still struggling to rebound from a prolonged U.S. economic slump. The measure would gradually raise Californias hourly minimum wage from the current level of $10 to $15 by 2022 for large businesses and by 2023 for smaller firms. It also would head off a pair of competing ballot initiatives lacking a provision to allow the governor to suspend the increases in hard economic times, a deal breaker for Brown. Raising the minimum wage has cropped up on many Democratic candidates agendas ahead of the November elections, and the issue could help galvanize supporters at the polls. But passage is not assured without backing from more moderate Democrats, including business-friendly Assembly members in swing districts who have recently held up bills that were priorities for the partys progressive wing, including a plan to cut the states greenhouse gas emissions. According to the governors office, 2.2 million Californians earn the state minimum wage of $10 an hour. The bill would ultimately benefit 5.6 million workers, raising their wages by an average of 24 percent, according to an analysis from the University of California, Berkeley. Retail employees account for 16 percent of affected workers, and restaurant employees 15 percent. ",politicsNews,"March 30, 2016 ",1
"Senator concerned over U.N., Iran missiles and nuclear pact","UNITED NATIONS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee said on Wednesday the U.N. Security Councils refusal to respond to Irans ballistic missile tests defied Obama administration assurances that a ban on such tests would remain in place after the Iran nuclear deal. As many of us feared, now it appears Iran can defy those restrictions with impunity fearing no pushback from the U.N. Security Council, Republican Senator Bob Corker said, in response to a report by Reuters that diplomats suggested Irans tests do not technically violate provisions of Security Council Resolution 2231. Corker authored legislation giving the U.S. Congress the right to review the international nuclear deal announced in July and joined other members of his party in opposing it. Many U.S. lawmakers have demanded more sanctions over the missile tests. Council diplomats told Reuters on Wednesday experts from the 15-nation body would discuss Irans missile work on Friday. They are expected to consider the possibility of a council statement condemning the missile program, the diplomats said.  Irans recent ballistic tests involved missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons and were inconsistent with and in defiance of council resolution 2231, adopted in July, the United States, Britain, France and Germany said in a joint letter to Spanish U.N. Ambassador Roman Oyarzun Marchesi and U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon. Spain has been assigned the task of coordinating council discussions on resolution 2231. The letter said missiles used in the recent launches were inherently capable of delivering nuclear weapons. It also asked that the Security Council discuss appropriate responses to Tehrans failure to comply with its obligations and urged Ban to report back on Iranian missile work inconsistent with 2231. The letter stopped short of calling the Iranian launches a violation of the resolution, which calls upon Iran to refrain for up to eight years from activity, including launches, related to ballistic missiles designed with the capability of delivering nuclear weapons. Security Council diplomats have said the case for new U.N. sanctions was weak, hinging on interpretation of ambiguous language in a resolution adopted as part of a July nuclear deal to drastically restrict Irans nuclear work. Russia, a veto-wielding permanent member, has made clear it considers compliance with the appeal in resolution 2231 to be voluntary. Tehran has also said it is under no obligation to comply with the appeal to refrain from missile work and vowed to continue developing ballistic missiles. ",politicsNews,"March 30, 2016 ",1

Connecticut governor signs bill to close $220 million budget gap,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Connecticuts governor signed on Wednesday legislation to close a $220 million budget gap by the end of the fiscal year on June 30, as the state battles a fiscal crisis set to worsen next year with a projected budget deficit of nearly $1 billion. The bill, which received bi-partisan support, comes on top of a series of budget cuts during the current fiscal year after revenue projections failed to meet projections, a fact officials blamed partly on weak capital gains tax receipts. The administration of Governor Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, has been fighting fires around the budget for most of the year. Indications are that the fiscal situation will worsen before it gets better. One report predicted the deficit could be as high as $900 million in the next fiscal year. Last month, Connecticut canceled pay increases for almost 2,000 managers at state agencies. The raises, which had been postponed twice, are now frozen indefinitely. Officials have said there will be reductions in staff numbers in the months ahead. The amount Connecticut pays to borrow has risen in relation to other municipal bond market borrowers, a sign investors see greater risk. Connecticut now pays 0.58 of a percentage point more than top-rated muni bond issuers to borrow for 10 years, up from 0.3 of a percentage point last year. Connecticut has a high investment grade rating at the major ratings agencies, although Moodys (Aa3) and Standard & Poors (AA) have a negative outlook on the state. Fitch rates Connecticut AA with a stable outlook. ",politicsNews,"March 30, 2016 ",1
Obama could decide on greater troop presence in Iraq soon: general,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will have the chance to decide on whether to increase the number of U.S. forces in Iraq in the coming weeks, the top U.S. general said on Wednesday. The extra troops would bolster the capabilities of Iraqi forces preparing for a major offensive against the Islamic State militant group in Mosul, U.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a news briefing. U.S. and Iraqi military officials have been discussing a plan to retake Mosul, which fell to Islamic State in June 2014, and how U.S. forces could support their efforts, Dunford said.  Those recommendations are being made and the president will have an opportunity to make some decisions here in the coming weeks, Dunford said. I brought it to the secretary (Defense Secretary Ash Carter). The secretary will engage with the president. Dunford said last week he expected an increase in the level of U.S. forces in Iraq from the current 3,800, but that those decisions had not been finalized. U.S. officials have said they hope to capitalize on recent battlefield successes against Islamic State, such as the retaking of Ramadi by Iraqi forces late last year. The timing really now is focused on the next phase of the campaign, which is towards Mosul, and maintaining the kind of momentum that we had in Ramadi, Dunford said.

Exclusive: Most Americans support torture against terror suspects - Reuters/Ipsos poll,"(Reuters) - Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe torture can be justified to extract information from suspected terrorists, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, a level of support similar to that seen in countries like Nigeria where militant attacks are common. The poll reflects a U.S. public on edge after the massacre of 14 people in San Bernardino in December and large-scale attacks in Europe in recent months, including a bombing claimed by the militant group Islamic State last week that killed at least 32 people in Belgium.  Donald Trump, the front-runner for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, has forcefully injected the issue of whether terrorism suspects should be tortured into the election campaign.  Trump has said he would seek to roll back President Barack Obamas ban on waterboarding - an interrogation technique that simulates drowning that human rights groups contend is illegal under the Geneva Conventions. Trump has also vowed to bring back a hell of a lot worse if elected. Trumps stance has drawn broad criticism from human rights organizations, world bodies, and political rivals. But the poll findings suggest that many Americans are aligned with Trump on the issue, although the survey did not ask respondents to define what they consider torture.  The public right now is coping with a host of negative emotions, said Elizabeth Zechmeister, a Vanderbilt University professor who has studied the link between terrorist threats and public opinion. Fear, anger, general anxiety: (Trump) gives a certain credibility to these feelings, she said. The March 22-28 online poll asked respondents if torture can be justified against suspected terrorists to obtain information about terrorism. About 25 percent said it is often justified while another 38 percent it is sometimes justified. Only 15 percent said torture should never be used.  Republicans were more accepting of torture to elicit information than Democrats: 82 percent of Republicans said torture is ""often"" or ""sometimes"" justified, compared with 53 percent of Democrats. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1ShObx1) About two-thirds of respondents also said they expected a terrorist attack on U.S. soil within the next six months. Surveys by other polling agencies in recent years have shown U.S. support for the use of torture at around 50 percent. A 2014 survey by Amnesty International, for example, put American support for torture at about 45 percent, compared with 64 percent in Nigeria, 66 percent in Kenya and 74 percent in India. Nigeria is battling a seven-year-old insurgency that has displaced 2 million people and killed thousands, while al Shabaab militants have launched a series of deadly attacks in Kenya. India is fighting a years-old Maoist insurgency that has killed hundreds. In November, terrorism replaced economy as the top concern for many Americans in Reuters/Ipsos polling, shortly after militants affiliated with the Islamic State killed 130 people in Paris. (Graphic: polling.reuters.com/#!poll/SC8/type/smallest/dates/20151101-20151231/collapsed/true/spotlight/1) At the same time, Trump surged in popularity among Republicans, who viewed him as the strongest candidate to deal with terrorism. Besides his advocacy of waterboarding, Trump said that he would bomb the hell out of ISIS, using an alternative acronym for Islamic State. Youre dealing with people who dont play by any rules. And I cant see why we would tie our hands and take away options like waterboarding, said Jo Ann Tieken, 71, a Trump supporter. Tieken said her views had been influenced by the injuries suffered by her two step-grandsons while serving in the military four years ago in Afghanistan. The Reuters/Ipsos poll included 1,976 people. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2.5 percentage points for the entire group and about 4 percentage points for both Democrats and Republicans.

Supreme Court sympathetic to property owner in wetlands dispute,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared likely to rule that property owners can challenge the federal government in court over the need for permits under a national water protection law in a case involving a companys plans for a Minnesota peat mine. The court heard a one-hour argument in a case balancing property rights and environmental law, in this instance the landmark 1972 U.S. Clean Water Act. A majority of the eight justices appeared sympathetic toward North Dakota-based Hawkes Co Inc, which is fighting an Obama administration finding that its property includes wetlands. The law mandates that property owners get permits in such situations. Whether a particular plot of land falls under the laws jurisdiction is important to developers and other property owners because such a finding triggers a lengthy and expensive permitting process. Hawkes lawyers argued the company should be able to contest whether it even needs to go through the permit process. Liberal and conservative justices alike expressed concern about the current arrangements burden on property owners. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts said applicants who disregard a government finding that they need a permit do so at great practical risk. Liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg called the process very arduous and very expensive. Liberal Stephen Breyer called the government decision that Hawkes needed a permit perfectly suited for review in the courts. Only liberal Elena Kagan expressed support for the government, raising concerns about the impact a ruling favoring property owners would have on actions by other government agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission. Property rights advocates said the permitting process can take two years and cost up to $270,000, with owners facing penalties of up to $37,500 a day for noncompliance. Business groups including the National Association of Home Builders and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 29 states filed court papers opposing the Obama administration in the case. The case follows the justices unanimous 2012 ruling that property owners facing enforcement action under the Clean Water Act can ask a court to intervene before being forced to comply or pay financial penalties. The Obama administration last year issued a new regulation defining the scope of federal jurisdiction over bodies of water. A federal appeals court put the rule on hold after it was challenged by 18 states. Only eight justices participated in the case following Justice Antonin Scalias February death. A ruling is due by the end of June. ",politicsNews,"March 30, 2016 ",1

Virginia governor vetoes religious protection bill,"(Reuters) - Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe on Wednesday vetoed a bill that would have allowed ministers and others refuse to marry gay couples because of their religious beliefs. McAuliffe, a Democrat, said the measure approved by the Republican-controlled legislature was unconstitutional and would drive business away from the state. Although couched as a religious freedom bill, this legislation is nothing more than an attempt to stigmatize, he said in a statement. The Republicans do not have enough votes in the states General Assembly to override the veto. The bill would have  granted ministers and others empowered to wed people the right to deny marriage services to same-sex couples if performing them would violate their religious beliefs. McAuliffes move comes just days after Georgias Republican governor said he would veto a similar bill after the measure drew national criticism.. Similar measures in states such as Indiana and Arkansas sparked criticism last year, forcing many lawmakers to retreat. North Carolina is also seeing protests over anew law that bars transgender people from choosing bathrooms consistent with their gender identity. ",politicsNews,"March 30, 2016 ",1
Sanctions 'overreach' risks driving business from U.S.: Treasury's Lew,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Overuse of harsh sanctions like those deployed against Iran to limit its nuclear program risks driving business activity from the United States and a move away from the dollar as the worlds reserve currency, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said on Wednesday. Sanctions have emerged as a favored policy tool of choice for the United States, which has used them against challenges as varied as drug trafficking, cyber attacks, jihadist financing, and Russian actions in Ukraine. The economic measures enable the U.S. government to blacklist people and organizations, banning U.S. and sometimes even foreign citizens from dealing with them and effectively barring them from the international financial system. For example, the United States was able to induce buyers of Iranian oil to sharply curtail their purchases, and international banks cut ties with Iran for fear of losing access to the U.S. financial system. Iran reached a deal with the United States and other world powers last July that lifted the harshest measures in return for curbs on its nuclear program. But sanctions overreach risks encouraging businesses to avoid the U.S. financial system and could erode the power of the U.S. dollar as the pre-eminent reserve currency, Lew said during a speech in Washington. The more we condition use of the dollar and our financial system on adherence to U.S. foreign policy, the more the risk of migration to other currencies and other financial systems in the medium-term grows, Lew said. In particular, so-called secondary sanctions should be wielded in the most exceptional circumstances, Lew said. Those measures bar even non-U.S. citizens from dealing with sanctioned individuals or companies, and were the type of sanctions levied against Iran. They are viewed even by some of our closest allies as extra-territorial attempts to apply U.S. foreign policy to the rest of the world, Lew said, adding that the Iran nuclear sanctions should not be viewed as a starting point for other sanctions programs. Republicans in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail have criticized the removal of sanctions on Iran, and legislators have tried to restrict President Barack Obamas ability to lift sanctions under the nuclear deal. But because Iran had kept its end of the deal, Lew said, the United States should uphold the sanctions relief it has promised. In recent weeks, Iranian leaders have complained that U.S. policies have forced major banks and corporations to stay away from Iran despite the formal lifting of sanctions in January.

"U.S. top court hands win to unions, splits 4-4 without Scalia","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Public sector unions triumphed before the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday when the justices preserved a vital source of cash for organized labor, splitting 4-4 on a conservative challenge that had seemed destined for success until Justice Antonin Scalias death last month. The case brought by non-union public school teachers in California had targeted fees that many states force such workers to pay unions in lieu of dues to fund collective bargaining and other activities. A loss in this case would have deprived unions representing teachers, police, transit workers, firefighters and other government employees of millions of dollars annually and diminished their political clout. The outcome illustrated the impact on the court of the Feb. 13 death of Scalia, the long-serving conservative justice who almost certainly would have cast a decisive vote against the unions. But by virtue of splitting 4-4, the justices affirmed a 2014 lower-court ruling that allowed California to compel non-union workers to pay the fees.  The death of Justice Scalia has proved a disaster for public sector workers who have their paychecks raided by unions, said Iain Murray, vice president for strategy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington.  The court, evenly divided with four liberals and four conservatives, left intact a 1977 legal precedent that allowed such fees, which conservatives have long abhorred. Conservatives for years have tried to curb the influence of public sector unions, which typically back the Democratic Party and liberal causes. The U.S. Supreme Court today rejected a political ploy to silence public employees like teachers, school bus drivers, cafeteria workers, higher education faculty and other educators to work together to shape their profession, said Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association teachers union. The case reached the high court after a Washington-based conservative group, the Center for Individual Rights, sued on behalf of lead plaintiff Rebecca Friedrichs, an elementary school teacher in Anaheim, and nine other teachers. They argued the fees infringed upon the free-speech rights of non-union workers under the U.S. Constitution. During Jan. 11 oral arguments in the case, Scalia was still on the bench, giving the court a majority of five conservatives. The conservative justices during the arguments voiced support for the non-union teachers. It is the second case in which the court has split 4-4 since Scalia died, with more likely in the coming months, perhaps including major cases on abortion, voting rights and contraception insurance coverage. It remains unclear when Scalia will be replaced. Senate Republicans have vowed to block confirmation of President Barack Obamas nominee to replace Scalia, centrist appellate judge Merrick Garland. Republicans fear Garlands confirmation would tilt the court to the left for the first time in decades. At issue in the case decided on Tuesday were so-called agency fees equivalent to union dues, currently mandatory for non-union workers under laws in about half the states including California. The decision means the status quo remains, with the unions able to collect fees from non-union workers. Californias non-union teachers pay the union, which has 325,000 members, around $600 annually in mandatory fees for collective bargaining. The non-union teachers lawyers said they plan to ask the court to rehear case. With the death of Justice Scalia, this outcome was not unexpected, said Terry Pell, president of the Center for Individual Rights. The split decision means there is ongoing doubt about the constitutionality of its forcible collection of millions of dollars in dues, Pell added. About 5 million public sector employees are subject to union contracts that include mandatory fee provisions, according to the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which backed the non-union teachers. Organized labor had expressed worries that a ruling throwing out the fees would give employees less incentive to join public-sector unions because they would get all the benefits of collective bargaining undertaken by unions without having to pay for it. The teachers who filed the lawsuit in 2013 asked the justices to overturn the 1977 Abood v. Detroit Board of Education Supreme Court ruling that allowed laws that permitted public sector unions to collect fees from workers who were not members as long as the money was not spent on political activities. Agency fees are already banned in 25 states that have so-called right-to-work laws. In those states, unions still represent workers but membership rates are lower. Federal employee unions also cannot collect such fees. The ruling comes as a relief to organized labor because unionized civil servants in states without right-to-work laws comprise its main power base. The court last week also split 4-4 split in a loan discrimination case. Last month, Dow Chemical Co opted to settle a class action case pending before the court for $835 million, citing Scalias death as a reason. Scalia was seen as a reliable vote for class action defendants. ",politicsNews,"March 29, 2016 ",1
Trump campaign manager charged with misdemeanor battery against reporter,"(Reuters) - Donald Trumps presidential campaign manager was arrested and charged with misdemeanor battery in Florida on Tuesday in an incident involving a reporter, the latest chapter in a raucous U.S. race marked by threats, insults and physical confrontations. Police in Jupiter, Florida, charged Corey Lewandowski, 42, with intentionally grabbing and bruising the arm of Michelle Fields, then a reporter for the conservative news outlet Breitbart, when she tried to question Trump at a campaign event on March 8. Republican front-runner Trump repeatedly defended Lewandowski throughout a day of campaigning in Wisconsin. He also rescinded a previous pledge to support the Republican presidential nominee if it is not him. No, not anymore, he said when asked if he would honor his previous pledge. At a CNN town hall on Tuesday night, Trump said he would remain loyal to his campaign manager and that Lewandowski would remain on the job even though it might be more convenient on behalf of his campaign to terminate this man, ruin his life, ruin his family ... ruin his whole everything and say: Youre fired. Trump also questioned Fields original description of the incident in which she said she was almost yanked to the ground by Lewandowski. He wondered aloud if she had posed a threat to him because she approached him with an ink pen. She had a pen in her hand that couldve been a knife, Trump said. Police released a video of the incident showing Fields walking alongside Trump and trying to question him. Lewandowski is seen grabbing her arm and pulling her backward. Previous videos of the incident had been obscured by people in the crowd. At the time, Lewandowski called Fields delusional and said he never touched her. Campaign rallies for Trump, the billionaire businessman who leads the race to become the Republican candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election, are tumultuous at times and have been marked by occasional clashes between protesters and supporters or security personnel. His pugnacious campaign style, which includes personal insults directed at rivals and scathing criticism of protesters, has been criticized for encouraging physical altercations at his rallies. Trump leads rivals Ted Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, and Ohio Governor John Kasich in opinion polls and in the number of delegates to the nominating convention, despite a concerted effort to stop him by a Republican establishment worried he will lead the party to defeat in November. Cruz said Trump of course should ask for Lewandowskis resignation. Look, it shouldnt be complicated that members of the campaign staff shouldnt be physically assaulting the press, Cruz said on the CNN town hall. Kasich said he considered such behavior totally and completely inappropriate. If it was me, if I was in this circumstance, I would take some sort of action, either suspension or firing, Kasich told reporters in Wisconsin. Cruz picked up the endorsement on Tuesday of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker ahead of the states primary next week. Walker, who dropped out of the presidential race last year, called Cruz a principled constitutional conservative. Im all in, Walker said in an interview on WTMJ radio in Milwaukee, adding he was not endorsing Cruz in an attempt to stop Trump. I just fundamentally believe if you look at the facts, if you look at the numbers, that Ted Cruz is in the best position by far to both win the nomination of the Republican Party and to then go on and defeat Hillary Clinton in the fall this year, Walker said, referring to the Democratic front-runner. Walker joins a number of other more establishment  Republicans who have backed Cruz as an alternative to Trump, who has racked up a strong delegate lead but alienated many party leaders with his harsh views on illegal immigration, Muslims and women. On his plane, Trump said Fields had been pursuing him after a news conference and Lewandowski was trying to get her off me. He questioned whether Lewandowski had given Fields the bruise on her arm. How do you know those bruises werent there before? he asked reporters in Wisconsin. Republican strategist Katie Packer, who runs an anti-Trump Super PAC, said the incident and the charges against Lewandowski reflected the candidates lack of respect toward women. He doesnt have the kind of values and the kind of temperament that we should expect from someone who wants to be commander in chief, she said. Lewandowski was charged with simple battery, defined under Florida law as intentionally touching or striking a person against their will. For a first offense, it is a misdemeanor in the first degree, which carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison or a fine of $1,000.  A court date was set for May 4, according to the police report. Jupiter police said Lewandowski turned himself in, and he was issued a notice requiring him to appear in court and then released. He was not booked into the jail.  Lewandowskis lawyer, Scott Richardson of West Palm Beach, Florida, declined to comment on whether his client would step down as campaign manager. Lewandowski will also be represented by Kendall Coffey, a Miami lawyer, the campaign said.  Fields resigned from Breitbart less than a week after the incident, citing what she said was the online news outlets refusal to stand behind her amid the allegations.

Trump drops pledge to back Republican presidential nominee other than himself,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican front-runner Donald Trump on Tuesday abandoned a pledge to support a party presidential nominee other than himself, a sign of increasing friction with chief rival Ted Cruz. No, I dont anymore, Trump replied, when asked at a CNN town hall event whether he still supported a pledge he made last year to support whoever is the Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election. Trumps signing of a loyalty pledge last September was important in helping him gain credibility within the Republican National Committee. The pledge was also signed by all his rivals for the presidential nomination. His aboutface came as he tries to fend off a challenge from Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas who is running second to the New York billionaire in the race for the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination. Trump and Cruz were enmeshed in a fight last week involving their wives, with a Cruz SuperPAC publishing a provocative photo of Trumps former model wife, Melania, and Trump retaliating by tweeting an unflattering photo of Cruzs wife, Heidi. Cruz, asked earlier at the CNN town hall whether he also would honor the pledge to support the nominee if it was not himself, declined to give a straight answer. Let me tell you my solution to that, Cruz said. Donald is not going to be the GOP nominee. Were going to beat him.  GOP is the acronym for Grand Old Party, a nickname for the Republican Party. Trump said he could do without Cruzs support. I watched him tonight and I watched how tormented he was when you asked him that question, Trump told CNN moderator Anderson Cooper. I dont want to have him be tormented. Let me just tell you I dont want his support, I dont need his support. I dont want him to be uncomfortable. Trump also said he recognized that several of those who have dropped out of the race might harbor ill feelings towards him, mentioning former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. Walker endorsed Cruz earlier on Tuesday, with Wisconsins primary vote coming up on April 5. I drove him out of the race, Trump said of Walker, who abandoned his presidential bid last autumn. I drove Jeb Bush out of the race, I drove Rand Paul out of the race. I understand why they dont like me. A third Republican presidential candidate, Ohio Governor John Kasich, was also tentative about honoring the pledge. He told the town hall he had been disturbed by some of the things Ive seen during the campaign, adding, I want to see how this finishes out. ",politicsNews,"March 30, 2016 ",1
How selecting U.S. presidential candidates became the people's choice,"(Reuters) - Republican Donald Trumps 2016 U.S. presidential candidacy has put the spotlight on the partys selection process, with prominent Republicans trying to derail Trumps efforts to sew up the nomination so they can force a showdown at the partys July nominating convention.  To some, the prospect of a contested convention suggests the party elite will ride roughshod over the voters. But the emergence of state-by-state primaries and caucuses that let voters play a deciding role is a modern construct.  In 1952 Adlai Stevenson won the Democratic nomination without taking part in any primaries. In 1968, Hubert Humphrey became the Democratic nominee without participating in any primaries. At the heart of changes in both the Republican and Democratic parties since then is a desire to select a nominee who is likely to win in the general election. Following is a guide to how the nomination process has evolved. Q: How did the nomination process evolve?  A: Political parties began to form early in the countrys existence, and party-based caucuses had developed by 1800. Caucuses in the 19th century were gatherings of the members of Congress of the various parties, and they picked the nominees. Q: How did we get from nominees chosen by member of Congress to nominating contests decided by registered voters?  A: Over time the caucuses were criticized as failing to uphold the U.S. Constitutions separation of powers because they made the selection of the president dependent on members of Congress. The election of 1812 brought that conflict to the fore because President James Madison was pressured by members of Congress to declare war on Great Britain if he wanted to be nominated for a second term. Q: How did that wind up changing things? A: The catalyst for change came in 1824 when the caucus process resulted in no candidate winning a majority of the votes in the Electoral College, a body of members selected by each state legislature to vote for president. The election ended up in the House of Representatives, which chose Secretary of State John Quincy Adams as president, even though Senator Andrew Jackson led both in the popular vote and in the Electoral College. That led to the two-party system, which has since dominated American politics, and to the nominating conventions.  Q: How were delegates to the conventions selected? A: Throughout the 19th century, the process was controlled by party insiders, who chose the delegates to the conventions. Those delegates voted for candidates in line with the wishes of party bosses. By the late 19th century there was a call to give individual voters a voice, and in the early 20th century some states began to hold primary elections to choose delegates for party nominating conventions.  The big change came in 1912 with the formation of the Progressive Party, also known as the Bull Moose Party, by former President Theodore Roosevelt and his supporters after Roosevelt failed to win the Republican nomination for a third term even though he won nine out of 10 primary elections held. The rest of the delegates at the partys convention had been selected by party bosses, and they voted for William Howard Taft as the Republican nominee.  The Progressive Party declared itself dedicated to upholding the principles of government of the people, by the people and for the people, and it called for primary elections for party nominations, saying there should be Nation-wide preferential primaries for candidates for the Presidency. Q: Were those primaries the same as todays nominating contests? A: Not really. As the 20th century progressed, more and more states began to hold primary elections to give citizens a voice. But primaries or caucuses werent held in all states and voters still didnt control the nominating process. Primaries became a sort of bellwether, sending a message to the party leaders, who controlled most of the delegates, as to whether a candidate would be viable in the general election. In 1960, when John Kennedy became the Democratic nominee, his victory in the West Virginia primary was seen as a strong sign that a Catholic could win the votes of Protestants. Q: So even in the 1960s it doesnt sound like primaries decided who the candidates would be. What changed? A: Lets look at the Republican and Democratic parties separately, because the parties set the rules for choosing delegates for their nominating conventions. The Democrats have tinkered with their delegate selection system in response to almost every election since 1968, as they struggled with the push-and-pull of who should pick the Democratic nominee: the party insiders who believe they know who can ultimately win the presidential election or the voters themselves. Heres the short-form history of what the Democrats have done: The 1968 election, when Hubert Humphrey, who eschewed the primaries in favor of courting officials who controlled the delegates, lost to Republican nominee Richard Nixon, led to reforms that essentially gave control of the nominating process to the popular vote. A number of states decided the easiest way to comply with the new rules would be to hold primaries. The 1972 election, when Democratic Senator George McGovern lost in a landslide to Nixon, spawned a sort of backlash, with a call to return some control over the nominating process to people who were expected to be party regulars and who would care more about party interests. State parties would be allowed to name up to 25 percent of a states delegates - a class now called superdelegates. The 1980 election, when President Jimmy Carter - who had battled Senator Ted Kennedy for the Democratic nomination - lost to Ronald Reagan, raised a call for more control by party leaders and public officials over the nominating process. The Democratic Party would now allow states to create winner-take-all processes for districts and mandate the election of unpledged party leaders and elected officials - the superdelegates. Those winner-take-all districts and the superdelegates became key to the selection of Walter Mondale as the Democratic nominee in 1984. He lost to Reagan. In 1988 the Democrats banned winner-take-all districts and said a candidate would have to win at least 15 percent of the popular vote to be awarded any delegates. Those rules still hold, though the number of superdelegates has grown. In 2008 superdelegates accounted for more than 18 percent of the total, and they ended up being the key deciders after neither of the top two Democratic contenders - Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton - won a majority of the pledged delegates. Q: Is that similar to the Republican situation? A: In a way, yes. The Republican Party does not have any superdelegates, but if no candidate wins a majority of the delegates prior to the July convention the delegates become free to change their votes, making them the deciders. Q: Has the Republican Party engaged in the kind of changes the Democrats have? A: No. The Republicans have given the states a lot of leeway in setting the rules for their primaries and caucuses. States can choose whether to award delegates proportionate to the popular vote, via a winner-take-all method or a combination of the two. The Republican Party in 2010 did say that states had to use proportional allocation for a certain period early in the season of nominating contests. That period was changed for the current election year to just the first two weeks of March. Q: So what happens if the Republicans end up with a brokered convention? A: A brokered convention would occur if no candidate has won a majority of the delegates ahead of the convention. (The magic number this year is 1,237 delegates.) At the convention, the delegates must initially vote according to the outcome of the popular vote from each state. But if no candidate has a majority of the delegates, that first ballot will be inconclusive. So the next step is the brokered convention, when the delegates are no longer bound by the outcome of the popular vote and can vote according to their own wishes. The vote is taken as many times as necessary until one candidate clears a majority of the delegates - something that occurs with a lot of dealmaking on the sidelines.

Puerto Rico draft rescue bill guided by U.S. bankruptcy rules,"WASHINGTON/SAN JUAN (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional draft bill to steer Puerto Rico through its economic crisis was released on Tuesday with elements of U.S. bankruptcy law opposed by creditors who want to keep the islands debt talks out of court. The draft, circulated by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Natural Resources, includes sections of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that allow bankrupt entities under certain circumstances to force creditors to take reduced payouts. An official draft of the bill is expected to be released on April 11 after a public comment period. Puerto Rico has $70 billion in debt, with major bond payments due in coming months. It also has an unfunded state pension liability of nearly $44 billion. The bill provides Puerto Rico with tools to impose discipline over its finances, meet its obligations and restore confidence in its institutions, Utah Republican Rob Bishop, the committees chairman, said in a statement. We appreciate the constructive efforts by Chairman Bishop and the House Natural Resources Committee to begin drafting legislation to address Puerto Ricos fiscal and economic crisis. But the current draft needs improvements, said a statement from a Treasury spokesperson. Final legislation must provide Puerto Rico with tools to achieve a lasting, workable solution to this crisis and create a path to recovery for the people of Puerto Rico. The Republican-led panels bill would create a federal board to oversee the islands finances, monitor its accounting and help curb spending. It would also require Puerto Rico to make efforts to restructure debt consensually with creditors. If those talks failed, the island or its public entities could file for a court-supervised debt restructuring process based on key statutes within U.S. bankruptcy law. That would allow Puerto Rico to force such deals on holdout creditors. The bills elements were unexpected because creditors and House Republicans had largely opposed bankruptcy for Puerto Rico. The Natural Resources Committee had said that retroactively adding territories like Puerto Rico to the federal bankruptcy code is ill-conceived and would undermine the rule of law. A congressional aide stressed that the draft legislation was not a bankruptcy law, and does not directly add Puerto Rico to U.S. bankruptcy code, though it follows similar language. The Obama Administration has advocated to allow Puerto Rico to restructure its debt in a court-sanctioned process. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the sweeping powers of the oversight board proposed in the bill. The bill in its final form may include language that protects an existing consensual restructuring deal between creditors and the power utility, PREPA, the congressional aide said. PREPA earlier this year reached the deal with creditors holding roughly 70 percent of its $8.3 billion in debt. The bill in its current form is fiscally irresponsible, financial adviser Stephen Spencer of Houlihan Lokey said in an emailed statement. The companys clients include major Puerto Rico creditors such as OppenheimerFunds and Franklin Advisers. As we showed with the PREPA deal, fair solutions can be reached between Puerto Rico and its creditors that benefit all stakeholders. However, the Discussion Draft Bill is worse for creditors than Chapter 9, Spencer said. How the oversight board treats the islands General Obligation bonds, which is typically regarded as the most senior debt, versus pension payments is also a source of concern for creditors. The oversight board will look at each bond issued and make a determination on how it relates to other creditors under the existing law, the congressional aide said. If the GO bonds are constitutionally protected and within their limits then the board would take that into consideration, the aide said. ",politicsNews,"March 30, 2016 ",1
Second judge says Clinton email setup may have been in 'bad faith',"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A second federal judge has taken the rare step of allowing a group suing for records from Hillary Clintons time as U.S. secretary of state to seek sworn testimony from officials, saying there was evidence of government wrong-doing and bad faith. The language in Judge Royce Lamberths order undercut the Democratic presidential contenders assertion she was allowed to set up a private email server in her home for her work as the countrys top diplomat and that the arrangement was not particularly unusual. He described Clintons email arrangement as extraordinary in his order filed on Tuesday in federal district court in Washington. Referring to the State Department, Clinton and Clintons aides, he said there had been constantly shifting admissions by the Government and the former government officials. Spokesmen for Clinton did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The case is a civil matter, but the order adds to the legal uncertainty that has overshadowed Clintons campaign to be the Democratic nominee in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The FBI is also conducting a criminal inquiry into the arrangement after it emerged that classified government secrets ended up in Clintons unsecured email account. Clinton has said she does not think she will be charged with a crime.  Lamberths order granted the request by Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group suing the department under open records laws, to gather evidence, including sworn testimony. The group has filed several lawsuits, including one seeking records about the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Where there is evidence of government wrong-doing and bad faith, as here, limited discovery is appropriate, even though it is exceedingly rare in FOIA (freedom-of-information) cases, Lamberth noted in his order. The government is normally given the benefit of the doubt that it properly searched and produced records.  Since the email arrangement came to public knowledge a year ago, the State Department has found itself defending Clinton in scores of lawsuits from groups, individuals and news outlets who say they were wrongly denied access to Clintons federal records. Clinton left the department in 2013, but did not return her email records to the government until nearly two years later.  Last month, Judge Emmet Sullivan, who is overseeing a separate Judicial Watch lawsuit over other Clinton-related records, allowed a similar motion for discovery.

"U.S. sanctions an important tool, not to be used 'frivolously': Treasury's Lew","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Economic sanctions are a powerful policy weapon but should not be wielded frivolously, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said in an interview to be aired on Tuesday. Sanctions - blacklisting individuals and organizations, effectively barring them from the global financial system - have become a favored tool for the United States. It has used them against challenges as varied as drug trafficking, cyber attacks and jihadist financing. But the impact has to be weighed as carefully as those of military force, Lew said in an interview with Public Television host Charlie Rose, according to a transcript of the interview released on Tuesday. We cant shy away from using sanctions because it will slow down growth, but we cant do it frivolously either, Lew said. Its a serious step, and its something that has to be guarded in order to have it in the future when you need it. U.S. sanctions have evolved over time from broad embargoes - such as the one imposed for decades on Cuba - to more targeted actions, he said, citing measures imposed on specific Russian industries in response to Russias intervention in Ukraine. Theyre targeted at the centers of power, where the decisions are being made, Lew said. The United States also should reward countries that change their behavior by removing sanctions, Lew said, pointing to measures against Iran that he credited with leading Tehran to agree to curb its nuclear program. Iran reached a deal with the United States and other world powers last July, winning relief from the harshest sanctions in return for limiting its nuclear program, which the West feared was aimed at building a weapon. When you have an agreement thats predicated on Change your policy and get relief from the sanctions, there has to be relief from the sanctions, Lew said. Otherwise, no one will ever respond to a sanctions regime by changing their policy. Reversing the Iran nuclear deal under a new administration - as Republican presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz has pledged to do - would be destabilizing and dangerous, Lew said. A broad economic embargo remains in place against Cuba, although President Barack Obama has used executive authority to allow commerce not specifically banned by Congress, as Washington and Havana move closer toward normal relations. Those improved ties are going to be a force for change in Cuba, Lew said. We werent getting it done the old way. ",politicsNews,"March 29, 2016 ",1
Wisconsin governor backs Republican Ted Cruz in presidential race,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz won the backing on Tuesday of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, gaining a boost in the contentious three-way race a week before that states presidential primary. Walker, himself a former Republican presidential candidate, emphasized he was not endorsing the U.S. senator from Texas in an effort to thwart Republican front-runner Donald Trump from clinching the partys nomination for the Nov. 8 election. To me, Im all in, Walker said in a radio interview on WTMJ radio in Milwaukee. He said he planned to campaign for Cruz throughout the state before the April 5 Wisconsin primary. Wisconsin polls, though scarce, show Trump and Cruz running neck-and-neck in the state. A recent Emerson poll showed Cruz taking 36 percent and Trump with 35 percent. Ohio Governor John Kasich lagged in third place, with 19 percent. Walker said he chose to back Cruz because he was a principled constitutional conservative who would stand up to big government special interests and give power to the states.  I just fundamentally believe if you look at the facts, if you look at the numbers, that Ted Cruz is in the best position by far to both win the nomination of the Republican Party and to then go on and defeat Hillary Clinton in the fall this year, Walker said.  Walkers endorsement adds to a number of other more mainstream Republicans stepping up behind Cruz as the best alternative to Trump, who has racked up a strong delegate lead but alienated many party leaders with his harsh views on immigration, Muslims and women.

"Scranton, Pennsylvania to sell sewer utility for $195 million","(Reuters) - The financially distressed city of Scranton, Pennsylvania, will soon sell its public sewer utility to a subsidiary of American Water Works Company Inc. for $195 million, a city official said on Tuesday. The deal would mark another step forward in the citys efforts to stabilize its budget. An old steel and coal town known as the Electric City and as the setting for the television series The Office, Scrantons finances have been under state oversight since 1992. The citys previous administration made headlines in 2012 when it cut police and firefighter pay to minimum wage for two weeks because it could not make payroll.     Without this deal the city wouldnt have been able to survive, financially anyway, Mayor William Courtright said late 9on Monday in televised remarks on the sewer utility sale. The Scranton Sewer Authoritys board authorized the sale to Pennsylvania American Water late on Monday, City Solicitor Jason A. Shrive told Reuters. Before the transaction can close, it needs governmental approvals from state public utility regulators and state and federal environmental protection agencies. The deal is expected to save the city $350 million over 30 years, plus another $140 million the authority must spend on environmental mediation under a consent decree. Ratepayers will likely see their rates increase on average 1.9 percent per year for the next 10 years, Shrive said, compared to 4.5 to 5 percent every year for the next 30 years if there were no sale.  That amounts to $7,600 of savings total for each ratepayer over the next three decades, Shrive said. A spokeswoman for Pennsylvania American Water, which already owns Scrantons drinking water system, declined to comment. Nationally, American Water expanded its customer base in 2015 by nearly 42,000 customers, with just over half of those coming from acquisitions that closed that year, according to a transcript of the companys fourth-quarter earnings call in February. Earlier this month, Scranton city officials also disclosed details of a $31.5 million deal to pay off a long-overdue labor award inherited from the previous administration. The city will pay about $29.3 million in back pay to police and firefighters, including retirees, and put a total of $1.59 million into the citys public pension funds. These steps, combined with a planned long-term lease of the citys parking authority that could be finalized by June, could get the city out of the state oversight program for distressed cities by the end of 2017, Shrive said.

Senator Kirk criticizes fellow Republicans on Garland boycott,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois on Tuesday accused many of his fellow Senate Republicans of being closed-minded by refusing to consider President Barack Obamas nomination of Merrick Garland to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. Kirk, facing a tough re-election battle in his Democratic-leaning state, became the first Republican senator to meet with Garland since Obama nominated the centrist appellate judge and former prosecutor on March 16 to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13. There is a need for open-minded, rational, responsible people to ensure the confirmation process works, Kirk told reporters before his private meeting with Garland, who already has met with some Senate Democrats. Most of the 100-member Senates 54 Republicans have backed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells hard-line stance against confirming any Obama nominee or even meeting with Garland. I think when you just say, Im not going to meet with him at all - thats too closed-minded, added Kirk, a first-term senator who may be one of the most endangered Senate Republicans in the Nov. 8 elections. Maines Susan Collins also took her fellow Senate Republicans to task for blocking Garlands confirmation process.  Collins told WGAN radio, Whether Republicans like him (Obama) or not, he is our president until inauguration day next January. Collins said there seemed to be no basis for senators to refuse even to consider Garland. McConnell has said the Senate should leave it to Obamas successor, who will take office next January after Novembers elections, to fill the vacancy. More than a dozen Senate Republicans have indicated a willingness to at least meet with Garland. Last week, Kansas Republican Senator Jerry Moran, also running for re-election, was assailed by conservative groups after urging that the confirmation process proceed, even though he made clear he would not vote for Garland. Meetings with senators are a standard part of the confirmation process, allowing lawmakers to get acquainted with nominees for a lifetime position on the Supreme Court. Republicans fear Garland could move the court to the left for the first time in decades. The White House said the courts split 4-4 ruling in an important labor case on Tuesday underscored the need to confirm Scalias replacement. With a Supreme Court that is not fully staffed, it makes it more likely that situations can arise across the country where there are different rulings in different circuit courts that are not resolved by the Supreme Court, spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One as Obama flew to Atlanta.

Higher taxes in Obama's budget would cut deficits: CBO,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obamas fiscal 2017 budget would produce $6.9 trillion in deficits over the next decade if enacted, about $2.4 trillion less than under current tax and spending laws, congressional forecasters said on Tuesday. The Congressional Budget Office said in a new analysis, however, that its 10-year deficit estimate is $776 billion higher than the administrations own forecast. This is largely the result of lower revenues resulting from the CBOs projections for slower economic growth, lower wage and salary growth, and lower revenue gains associated with Obamas tax proposals. Obamas budget calls for limiting tax deductions for high-income taxpayers, increasing capital gains taxes, and imposing minimum taxes on foreign income and about a $10-a-barrel oil tax. The CBOs estimate of a $2.8 trillion revenue gain through fiscal 2026 would also partly come from the enactment of immigration reforms, estimated to result in $386 billion in new revenue over the decade. Obamas budget plan has no chance of passing in the Republican-controlled Congress. The House and the Senate are working on budget resolutions that are expected to adhere to spending limits agreed to in a two-year budget deal largely negotiated last year by former House Speaker John Boehner and the White House. Some Republican conservatives, however, have called for lower spending levels for government agencies or savings elsewhere in the budget.   The nonpartisan CBO said that spending outlays would also be higher in Obamas budget by about $400 billion over the 10-year period than under current laws. In the near term, the agency said, the deficit under Obamas budget for fiscal 2017 would be $433 billion, versus $550 billion under current law. In 2018, the deficit would fall to $383 billion, or 1.9 percent of gross domestic product, before steadily climbing to $972 billion, or 3.5 percent of GDP, in 2026 as costs associated with aging Baby Boomers mount.  Over the decade, the CBO said, the cumulative 10-year deficit would be 3 percent versus 4 percent with no changes in law. Many economists say deficits under 3 percent of GDP are considered sustainable. Debt held by the public in 2026 would be 77.4 percent of GDP under Obamas budget versus the current trajectory of 85.6 percent. ",politicsNews,"March 29, 2016 ",1
Illinois governor undeterred by court ruling in union dues fight,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner vowed to pursue a legal challenge against union dues the state collects from non-unionized, rank-and-file government workers despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday that upheld the practice. In a victory for labor, a 4-4 deadlock by the nations high court allowed a federal appeals court opinion to stand against 10 non-unionized California public school teachers who contended so-called fair-share dues should not be withheld from their paychecks if they chose against union membership. But the court move likely does not settle the issue, because nearly identical federal litigation in Illinois that Rauner helped launch last year remains viable. Our case is winding its way through the courts, and it will get to the Supreme Court probably at some point in the future, Rauner said during a stop in rural Illinois on Tuesday. And we will just continue the fight for the freedom of political expression and the right of free speech for government employees. Its a fundamental issue. Since taking office in 2015, the first-term Republican governor has waged war with public-sector unions in a bid to weaken their longstanding influence over state politics. During his first month in office, the governor signed an executive order to bar state agencies from withholding fair-share dues, which non-unionized employees must pay under Illinois law and collective-bargaining agreements to support non-political union activities that benefit all workers. Public-sector unions sued in Illinois state court to block Rauners executive order from being implemented and persuaded a judge to allow the fees to continue to be collected while the case, which is still pending, was litigated. Simultaneously, Rauner sued in federal court to challenge the fees, but last May he was dismissed from the case by a judge, who ruled the governor lacked legal standing. Three non-unionized Illinois workers forced to pay between $19.75 and $60.86 in union dues per paycheck were allowed to proceed with their own complaint. A spokesman for the union representing the largest bloc of state workers called Tuesdays Supreme Court ruling a win but acknowledged the Illinois case may become the next fair-share battlefront. These attacks are political, and theyre ideological. Theyre brought by people who want to rig the economy and our democracy in their favor. Theyre not going to stop because they lost this particular challenge. Theyll bring another one, said Anders Lindall, a spokesman for AFSCME Council 31. ",politicsNews,"March 29, 2016 ",1
Apple shares are one reason hedge funds lag mutual funds in 2016,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge funds may have taken too big a bite of Apple Inc (AAPL.O).  Shares of the iPhone maker are one of the biggest bets among hedge funds, with 47 of them listing Apple among their ten largest holdings as of the end of 2015, according to a report from Goldman Sachs on March 18. At the same time, mutual funds are going the opposite direction: Apple is their second-largest underweight holding, meaning the funds invest less of their portfolio in the company than its percentage weighting in the benchmark S&P 500 index. The difference of opinion on Apple, with shares flat year to date, is one reason hedge funds are again lagging. The average hedge fund was down 3.3 percent through February, while the average large-cap core mutual fund fell just 0.8 percent, according to data from fund tracker Morningstar.  Mutual funds, meanwhile, have benefited from being overweight in Facebook Inc (FB.O), CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), according to Goldman.  Mutual fund managers believe Apple no longer enjoys the outsized prospects it had in the past. Weve done very well with this company for a long time but its so large now that its becoming impossible for it to move the needle meaningfully in terms of revenue growth or profits, said one fund manager from a well-known firm. The manager, who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly, sold all of his shares in the company.  Shares of Apple fell 6.5 percent on Jan. 27, the day after the company reported its slowest-ever rise in iPhone shipments and forecast quarterly sales declining for the first time in 13 years. The stock dipped 0.7 percent to $105.32 on Thursday.   With the higher concentration of hedge funds owning the stock, Apple should brace for more activist calls to raise its dividend, offer more share buybacks, or acquire more companies to increase short-term returns, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at S&P Capital IQ. Your typical mutual fund manager is going to have more patience than your typical hedge fund manager, who if they have a sizeable stake are going to push for structural or corporate changes to enhance shareholder value, he said.  Hedge fund Bridgewater Associates increased its stake in Apple by 19 percent during the fourth quarter of 2015, while Tiger Global Management initiated a position, buying 10.6 million shares in the same period, according to SEC filings. At the same time, well-known activists such as Carl Icahn and David Einhorn have trimmed their positions..  Hedge fund manager Morris Mark, whose firm Mark Asset Management oversees $500 million in assets, said he is maintaining a large position in Apple, even as the shares flat line. He sees the iPhone as the gateway into new home-based products.  Theyre going to come out with more services layered on top of this incredible franchise, and you are going to see their entire ecosystem grow, he said. ",politicsNews,"March 24, 2016 ",1
Spy chiefs tell U.S. lawmakers plan to share raw data protects privacy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American spy chiefs have told congressmen that a plan to allow the National Security Agency (NSA) to share more raw eavesdropping reports with other agencies will not be unlawful and will protect the privacy rights of U.S. citizens. In a letter sent on Monday to two members of Congress and reviewed by Reuters, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said the NSAs proposal to give other spy agencies access to unevaluated signals intelligence will ensure data is used only for intelligence activities directed at foreigners. Last week, U.S. Representatives Ted Lieu and Blake Farenthold of the House Oversight Committee asked the NSA to halt the sharing plan, suggesting it would be unconstitutional and dangerous. The specifics of the proposal are still secret. Lieu, a Democrat from California and Farenthold, a Republican from Texas, wrote in a March 21 letter to NSA Director Michael Rogers that the proposal would violate Fourth Amendment privacy protections because the collected data would not require a warrant before being searched for domestic law enforcement purposes. Mondays reply from the intelligence chiefs office said the plan would not allow the use of communications data for domestic law enforcement. Instead, the proposed rules would limit access to raw NSA data to spy agencies, and only for authorized foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes, said the letter. It said it would also not authorize any new collection of private communications. Civil liberties advocates have interpreted the proposed change as potentially allowing NSA foreign intelligence data, which sometimes can include collection of communications to, from or about Americans, to be used for domestic policing purposes. Under current procedures, NSA analysts are supposed to scrub or black out certain personal information, particularly related to American citizens or residents, before handing any communications data over to other agencies. Congress last year passed a law curtailing certain aspects of the NSAs spying authority, most notably ending its bulk collection of domestic phone records exposed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013. NSA began that program after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States by Islamist militants. The NSA has presented the plan to a government advisory committee, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, for review. ",politicsNews,"March 29, 2016 ",1
California deal could make state first with $15 minimum wage,"SACRAMENTO (Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown announced a deal with legislative and labor leaders on Monday to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2023, saying the nations most-populous state would lead the way toward higher pay for the working poor. The proposal, which still must gain support from business-friendly moderate Democrats, would make California the first to raise the statewide minimum wage to $15 an hour - the highest in the nation - while giving the governor the right to opt out if the economy falters. Im hoping that what happens in California will not just stay in California but will be exported to the rest of the country, Brown said at a news conference in Sacramento. Raising the minimum wage has cropped up on many Democratic Party candidates agendas ahead of the November elections and the issue could help mobilize Democratic voters to the polls. According to the governors office, 2.2 million Californians currently earn the state minimum wage of $10 an hour.  The idea of raising the minimum wage, which at the federal level has remained at $7.25 an hour for more than six years, has been opposed by Republicans and some business groups, who say it would harm small businesses and strain government budgets.      If passed, Browns plan would commit the state, home to one of the worlds biggest economies, to raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022 for large businesses and 2023 for smaller firms. It would also head off a pair of competing ballot initiatives championed by labor leaders to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour without allowing the governor to halt increases in bad times, a deal-breaker for Brown.   But passage of the proposal is not guaranteed without support from more moderate members of the Democrat-controlled legislature. Absent from the press conference was Anthony Rendon, speaker of the state Assembly, where the bill was expected to face opposition.  This deal was placed on my desk over the weekend, said Rendon, who supports the measure but said he was not involved in negotiations over it. I dont know how many folks are in support of the bill or how many are against it. Democratic presidential hopeful U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders has called for raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020.  Economic consultant Christopher Thornberg, founding partner at Beacon Economics, said increasing the minimum wage would not reduce poverty because low paid workers were most at risk of losing their jobs when employers cut positions. These are the people that businesses will say, If Im going to pay $15 bucks an hour, Im not going to hire them, Thornberg said. Fourteen states and several cities began 2016 with minimum wage increases, typically phasing in raises that will ultimately take them to between $10 and $15 an hour.

Clinton warns of possible Trump Supreme Court nominations,"WASHINGTON - Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton rebuked Senate Republicans on Monday for denying a hearing to U.S. Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, accusing them of obstructionism, and warned of dangers if Donald Trump appointed the next justice. In a speech in Wisconsin, Clinton put the future of the Supreme Court at the center of the election debate, cautioning that any Trump-appointed justices would be likely to roll back workers and abortion rights and demolish pillars of the progressive movement. What kind of justice would a President Trump appoint, or for that matter what kind of attorney general? she asked, noting the Republican front-runner wants a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country and the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants. Once you make the extreme normal, you open the door to even worse, she said in Madison, Wisconsin, as part of a two-day trip to the state ahead of its April 5 Democratic and Republican primary elections. Clinton called on Republican Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to do his job and convene a hearing for Garland, a moderate federal appeals judge who is President Barack Obamas nominee to fill the seat vacated by the Feb. 13 death of Antonin Scalia. Grassley and other Senate Republicans have said they will not hold a hearing or a vote on an Obama nominee in a presidential election year, contending that voters should have a say when they elect the next president on Nov. 8. Id say my voice is being ignored right now because of their obstructionism, Clinton said. We chose a president  we chose him twice  and now Republicans in the Senate are acting like our votes didnt count and President Obama is not still our nations leader. Clinton said the Republican refusal to consider Garland was the latest in a long line of actions aimed at disrupting our government and undermining our president, and the result is an America that is more divided, less functional and less secure. Grassley, a six-term senator from Iowa who has tangled with Clinton over the investigation into her use of a private e-mail account while secretary of state, responded that Clinton wanted to distract voters from the ongoing email investigations. This is simply a blatant attempt by Secretary Clinton to politicize the Supreme Court and to change the conversation, Grassley, who heads the committee that must hold hearings on any Supreme Court nominee, said in a statement ahead of Clintons speech. Clinton has apologized for the email arrangement, which is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and has been slammed by Republicans for potentially compromising security. Clinton has said she did nothing wrong and she believes the government will vindicate her. Garland traveled to Capitol Hill on Monday to meet with Democratic Senators Ben Cardin of Maryland and Joe Donnelly of Indiana. His first visit with a Republican, Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois, is scheduled for Tuesday. Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to Grassley on Monday and proposed hearings on Garland in April, with votes on the nomination by May 25. Clintons speech came as her campaign aides argued with rival Bernie Sanders campaign in competing calls with the media over whether Sanders has a viable path to the Democratic presidential nomination. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, won contests in Alaska, Hawaii and Washington on Saturday, chipping away at Clintons lead in the race for the 2,382 delegates needed to secure the Democratic nomination at the partys Philadelphia convention in July. Clinton now has a lead of 268 pledged delegates over Sanders. When superdelegates, party leaders who can support any candidate, are added, Clinton leads 1,712-1,004, according to an Associated Press count. But Sanders aides said he could eclipse Clintons advantage once the final round of contests are held on June 7, and that superdelegates would begin to switch to back Sanders once he did. We are in this to win it, and there is a path to do so, campaign manager Jeff Weaver said. Clintons campaign described her lead as insurmountable given the partys proportional allocation of delegates in all states, which means Clinton will keep piling up delegates even in states Sanders wins. You have to win these big states very big, you have to win by landslides to make up the deficit, Clinton strategist Joel Benenson told reporters. Trump also plans to campaign in Wisconsin this week as he seeks to build his lead over Republican rivals U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich.  Trump has won 738 of the 1,237 delegates needed to take the Republican nomination at its July convention in Cleveland. Cruz has won 463, while Kasich has won 143, according to The New York Times.

U.S. top court seeks more information in contraception insurance case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday asked both sides for new information in a challenge by Christian nonprofit employers to a mandate under President Barack Obamas healthcare law to provide insurance to female workers covering birth control, indicating the justices are struggling to decide the closely watched case. The courts order requested more information on how contraceptive coverage can be obtained in a way that does not require any involvement by these employers, who object to the requirement on religious grounds. The Supreme Court suggested that one way to resolve the case would be for insurance companies to have the job of notifying employers about the availability of contraception coverage if their religious employer does not provide it. In the oral argument in the case last week, the shorthanded eight-justice court appeared split, raising the possibility of a 4-4 decision that would leave in place lower court rulings that backed the Obama administration. The court, now evenly divided with four conservatives and four liberals, is one justice short following the death of conservative Antonin Scalia in February. The order in the contraception matter came just hours after the court deadlocked 4-4 in another major case: a conservative challenge to a critical source of funding for public sector unions.. The request for additional information could both delay a ruling and indicate the court is seeking a compromise that a majority of justices could back. A ruling is due by the end of June. Dubbed Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act was passed by Congress in 2010 over unified Republican opposition and is seen as Obamas signature legislative achievement. But congressional Republicans have repeatedly sought to repeal it and conservatives have launched numerous legal challenges, with the Supreme Court in 2012 and 2015 issuing high-profile rulings preserving it. In the current case, Christian nonprofit employers objected to a 2013 compromise offered by the Obama administration that allowed entities opposed to providing contraception insurance coverage to comply with the law without actually paying for the required coverage. Groups can certify they are opting out of the mandate by signing a form and submitting it to the government. The government then asks insurers to pay for contraception. The challengers primarily are Roman Catholic including the archdiocese of Washington and the Little Sisters of the Poor order of nuns that runs care homes for the elderly. They contend the accommodation violates their religious rights by forcing them to authorize the coverage for their employees even if they are not paying for it. ",politicsNews,"March 29, 2016 ",1
Campaign rhetoric on Muslims harms U.S. security efforts: Homeland Security chief,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Harsh rhetoric about Muslims by Republican candidates in the U.S. presidential election campaign is undermining national security efforts, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on Tuesday. Asked about comments by Republicans Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, Johnson told MSNBC in an interview that singling out a specific community hampers government efforts to build the connections needed to thwart possible attacks. Inflammatory comments about patrolling and securing Muslim neighbors or barring Muslims from entering this country, having an immigration policy based on religion, is counterproductive to our homeland security and national security interests, he said. Johnsons remarks come in the wake of attacks last week in Belgium claimed by Islamic State militants that have stoked security fears across Europe and the West.  U.S. officials have said there is no immediate known threat to the United States and have vowed to work with European authorities following those attacks, which targeted the Brussels airport and a subway station and killed at least 35 people.    Heightened concern over security has rippled through the nomination race for the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, called for police to patrol American Muslim neighborhoods following the Brussels bombings. Billionaire businessman Trump has continued his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. The rhetoric has polarized the U.S. electorate and prompted criticism, particularly from Democrats, including President Barack Obama. Ohio Governor John Kasich, who is running a distant third in the Republican race for the nomination, on Tuesday blasted both of his rivals comments on security and said there should be more of a focus on intelligence-gathering and global cooperation, especially with help from Muslim communities. Its so absurd, Kasich said at a campaign event. Johnson said officials have worked hard to connect with American Muslim communities to garner their assistance with U.S. national security efforts.In this phase, it is critical that we build bridges to American-Muslim communities, not vilify them, not drive them into the shadows, and encourage them to work with us, he said.   Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, has urged the United States and Europe to do more to defeat Islamic State and has slammed Cruz and Trumps rhetoric toward Muslims. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clintons rival for the Democratic nomination, has also said he opposes surveillance of Muslim communities but backs stronger intelligence-sharing and monitoring of social media in the fight against Islamist militants.

Virginia governor vetoes bill cutting Planned Parenthood funding,"(Reuters) - Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe on Tuesday vetoed a Republican-backed bill aimed at blocking state funding for Planned Parenthood, which performs abortions and provides other health services. McAuliffe, a Democrat, said the bill passed by the Republican-dominated legislature would harm thousands of state residents who relied on Planned Parenthood for health care. The fact is that Virginians, and particularly low-income Virginians, need more access to health care, not less, he said in a statement. Several states have sought to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood following the release of videos secretly recorded by an anti-abortion group.  Activists have said the videos showed that Planned Parenthood officials in some states had discussed the sale of aborted fetal tissue. Planned Parenthood has denied the accusations. President Barack Obama in January vetoed a effort by Congress to defund Planned Parenthood. ",politicsNews,"March 29, 2016 ",1
Obama says journalists partly to blame for tone of presidential race,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Monday laid some of the blame for the tone of the presidential campaign on political journalism that has been pinched by shrinking newsroom budgets and cheapened by a focus on retweets and likes on social media. In a speech to a journalism awards dinner, Obama urged journalists to ask tougher questions of the candidates vying to be president. He voiced dismay over the vulgar rhetoric, violence at rallies and unrealistic campaign pledges that have continually grabbed headlines, in a thinly veiled reference to Republican front-runner Donald Trump. The number one question Im getting as I travel around the world or talk to world leaders right now is, What is happening in America? about our politics, Obama said, describing international alarm over whether the United States will continue to function effectively. Its not because around the world people have not seen crazy politics. It is that they understand America is the place where you cant afford completely crazy politics, he said. When our elected officials and our political campaigns become entirely untethered to reason and facts and analysis, when it doesnt matter whats true and whats not, that makes it all but impossible for us to make good decisions on behalf of future generations, Obama said. He said the media landscape has changed since his first presidential campaign in 2008, when there was a price if you said one thing and then did something completely different. The question is, in the current media environment, is that still true? Does that still hold? he said. He said news organizations have a responsibility to dig deeper despite the faster pace of this smartphone age and steep financial pressures in the news business. Voters would be better served if billions of dollars in free media came with serious accountability, especially when politicians issue unworkable plans or make promises they cant keep, Obama said. The New York Times earlier this month reported that Trump has so far earned almost $1.9 billion worth of media coverage, compared with $313 million for the next closest Republican challenger, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, and $746 million for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.

U.S. lawmakers want health agencies to lower prostate cancer drug cost,"(Reuters) - A group of lawmakers is calling on the National Institutes of Health and Department of Health and Human Services to step in and reduce the cost of Medivation Incs and Astellas Pharma Incs prostate cancer drug Xtandi. In the letter signed by Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and Reps. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) and Peter Welch (D-Vt.), the lawmakers urged NIH to hold a public hearing to consider overriding the patent on Xtandi to make the drug available at a lower price. The medication has an average wholesale price in the United States of more than $129,000 but is sold in Japan and Sweden for $39,000 and in Canada for $30,000, according to the lawmakers letter, addressed to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell and NIH Director Francis Collins. They noted federal funds supported development of the drug, which was based on research at the University of California, Los Angeles, conducted with taxpayer-supported grants.  When Americans pay for research that results in a pharmaceutical, that drug should be available at a reasonable price, said Doggett, co-chair of the House Democratic Caucus Prescription Drug Task Force. An unaffordable drug is 100 percent ineffective. A spokesman for Astellas said 81 percent of privately insured patients paid $25 or less out of pocket per month for the medication in 2015 and 79 percent of Medicare patients paid nothing out of pocket. For eligible patients who do not have insurance or are underinsured and have an annual adjusted household income of $100,000 or less, Astellas provides Xtandi for free, spokesman Tyler Marciniak said.  Of the 20,000 men treated with Xtandi last year, more than 2,000 received the drug for free, he added. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in America, affecting about one in seven men, according to the American Cancer Society. U.S. lawmakers and presidential candidates have in recent months stepped up criticism of U.S. drug price trends, raising investor concerns that future price cuts could hurt pharmaceutical and biotech companies.  The United States government should use every tool available to lower outrageously high prescription drug prices, Sanders said. NIH has the power to stop this blatant profiteering and put the pharmaceutical industry on notice that the era of charging unconscionable prices must end. Medivation could not be reached for comment. Spokesmen for the NIH and HHS could not be reached. Also signing the letter were Sens. Al Franken (D-Minn.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), as well as Reps.

North Carolina transgender bathroom law faces federal court test,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - Transgender people barred under a new North Carolina law from choosing bathrooms consistent with their gender identity filed a federal lawsuit on Monday, arguing the measure was discriminatory and threatened their personal safety. North Carolina last week became the first state to enact a measure requiring people to use bathrooms or locker rooms in schools and other public facilities that match the gender on their birth certificate, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.  By singling out LGBT people for disfavored treatment and explicitly writing discrimination against transgender people into state law, (the state) violates the most basic guarantees of equal treatment and the U.S. Constitution, said the lawsuit, which was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal. The states Republican-dominated legislature passed the law during a one-day special session called to repeal a Charlotte city ordinance that would have allowed bathroom choice based on gender identity versus sex at birth. State lawmakers also voted to prohibit local governments from enacting anti-discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity.  The actions drew swift criticism from lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy groups and companies including American Airlines, Apple and Google.  In response to the law, the mayors of San Francisco and Seattle as well as New York Governor Andrew Cuomo have barred non-essential, publicly funded government travel to the state, saying the law is discriminatory. North Carolina Senate leader Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore, both Republicans, said they were confident the law would be upheld in court. This lawsuit takes this debate out of the hands of voters and instead attempts to argue with a straight face that there is a previously undiscovered right in the U.S. Constitution for men to use womens bathrooms and locker rooms, they said in a joint statement. State lawmakers have warned of the dangers that could result from men sharing bathrooms with women and young girls. But transgender plaintiffs said they would be vulnerable because making known they are transgender puts them at high risk of violence. This is about more than restrooms. This is about my job, my community and my ability to get safely through my day, said Joaquin Carcano, a 27-year-old university employee who is a plaintiff in the suit.  Chase Strangio, a staff attorney with the national ACLUs LGBT Project, said on Monday the new law on bathroom access has no clear enforcement mechanism.  Opponents of the law criticized Republican Governor Pat McCrory, who is seeking re-election in November, for signing the sweeping legislation on the same day it was introduced. They noted the weeks of debate and review given to a Georgia measure that sought to strengthen legal protections for gay marriage opponents before Republican Governor Nathan Deal signaled on Monday he would veto it. By contrast, what happened here in North Carolina was a farce, said Chris Brook, legal director for the ACLU of North Carolina. ",politicsNews,"March 28, 2016 ",1

Secret Service says 'no' to guns at Republican convention,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Secret Service will not allow people to carry guns into the July Republican National Convention in Cleveland, quashing the hopes of more than 45,000 people who have signed a petition saying attendees should be allowed to bring firearms. The Secret Service said on Monday it has the authority to preclude guns from sites visited by the people it protects such as U.S. presidential candidates, presidents and former presidents. Only authorized law enforcement personnel working in conjunction with the Secret Service for a particular event may carry a firearm inside of the protected site, agency spokesman Robert Hoback said in a statement. Individuals determined to be carrying firearms will not be allowed past a predetermined outer perimeter checkpoint, regardless of whether they possess a ticket to the event, he said. A petition on change.org called for firearms to be allowed into the Quicken Loans Arena during the convention in Ohio, a state that allows guns to be carried openly in public. It had drawn 45,811 supporters by Monday afternoon. The arenas rules forbid firearms or other weapons, which the petition says is a direct affront to the U.S. Constitutions Second Amendment right to bear arms. It called  Cleveland one of the most dangerous U.S. cities. With this irresponsible and hypocritical act of selecting a gun-free zone for the convention, the RNC has placed its members, delegates, candidates and all U.S. citizens in grave danger, it said. The petition called for five actions to enable gun owners to carry their weapons into the venue. One of those recommendations was for Ohio Governor John Kasich, a Republican presidential candidate, to use his executive authority to override the arenas decision to be a gun-free zone. But Rob Nichols, a spokesman for the Kasich campaign, said the Secret Service had made its decision. At this point the Secret Service has already weighed in and whoever is the force behind this petition probably should have gone to the Secret Service from the get-go, he said. The Republican convention may be contested if front-runner Donald Trump does not receive enough delegates to clinch his partys nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Trumps rallies have been punctuated by protesters, and sometimes clashes. He has warned there would be riots if he is denied the nomination. ",politicsNews,"March 28, 2016 ",1
Supreme Court rejects Illinois ex-governor's corruption appeal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected flamboyant former two-term Democratic Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevichs appeal of convictions on corruption charges including attempted extortion from campaign contributors, wire fraud and other crimes. The court left in place last Julys ruling by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upholding the bulk of the convictions.     Blagojevich began serving a 14-year prison sentence in 2012. Prosecutors said Blagojevich was at the center of a conspiracy to seek cash, campaign contributions and jobs for himself and others in exchange for state appointments, state business, legislation and pension fund investments. Among those actions were attempts to leverage his authority as governor to appoint a U.S. senator from Illinois when Barack Obama left his Senate seat after being elected president in 2008, prosecutors said. Patti Blagojevich, the former governors wife, expressed disappointment with the courts action. We are hopeful that after the governor is resentenced, as a result of a federal appeals court tossing out five of the counts against him, that the highest court may be moved to take the case then, she said in a statement released by a spokesman. This was, of course, not the outcome that Rod, our daughters Amy and Annie, had hoped and prayed for. But we continue to have faith in the system. Blagojevich, first elected in 2002, was arrested in 2008 while still governor and was impeached by the states General Assembly in 2009, becoming the first Illinois governor to be removed from office. His 18 convictions, five of which were thrown out by the appeals court, came in two jury trials. From the time of his arrest until his conviction, Blagojevich launched a national campaign to proclaim his innocence, appearing on television shows including Donald Trumps program Celebrity Apprentice. Blagojevich was caught on court-approved wiretaps describing the Senate seat as something so valuable you just dont give it away for nothing. Blagojevich added he might appoint himself if he could not get anything for the seat. He was known for his love of Elvis Presley, his tendency to quote poetry and his full head of carefully tended thick black hair. He was criticized while in office for rarely being in the state capital of Springfield, and letting legislation stall. Blagojevich was the fourth former Illinois governor to be convicted of criminal charges since 1973. The case is Blagojevich v. United States, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 15-664.

"Youngstown, Ohio, mayor gets probation in corruption plea deal","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - The mayor of Youngstown, Ohio, was sentenced on Monday to a year of probation for his role in a public corruption case involving a property deal made while he was a county commissioner, a county prosecutors office said, but he will remain in office.   Youngstown Mayor John McNally, a Democrat, was sentenced in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court in Cleveland after pleading guilty to four misdemeanor counts, said Cuyahoga County Prosecutor spokesman Joe Frolik. The plea deal allows McNally, who was elected mayor in 2014, to remain in office. The charges stemmed from his nine years as Mahoning County commissioner, from 2005 until he was elected mayor. McNally had faced multiple felony charges, including bribery, record tampering and money laundering. But as part of the agreement with prosecutors he pleaded guilty to two counts of falsification, one count of attempted unlawful use of telecommunications and one count of attempted restrictions on present or former public officials, all misdemeanors, officials said.  Under Ohio law, a felony conviction bars anyone from holding most public offices for seven years. Also on Monday, former Mahoning County Auditor Michael Sciortino was sentenced by Judge Janet Burnside to one year of probation after pleading guilty to one felony count and three misdemeanors for his role in the matter, Frolik said.  Based on the plea deals, McNally had faced a maximum of 36 months in prison and Sciortino a maximum of 2-1/2 years.     Both McNally and Sciortino were initially charged for taking part in a scheme to inflate the cost of moving the Mahoning County jobs and family services office from a rental property to benefit a local business owner, prosecutors said. In addition to the plea in the Cuyahoga County court, Sciortino agreed to plead guilty to one felony and one misdemeanor in Mahoning County court on Thursday, according to court records.     Youngstown attorney Martin Yavorcik, 42, was convicted on eight felony counts in the Cuyahoga County court on Friday as part of the 83-count indictment brought against the three men in 2014 by the Ohio Attorney Generals office alleging a pattern of corruption.  Sentencing for Yavorcik is scheduled for April 22. He faces up to 29 years in prison, Frolik said. ",politicsNews,"March 28, 2016 ",1
Georgia governor to veto religious protection seen as anti-gay,"ATLANTA (Reuters) - Georgia Governor Nathan Deal said on Monday he will veto a so-called religious freedom bill passed by the state legislature that has drawn national criticism for discriminating against same-sex couples. The measure, which states that no pastor can be forced to perform a same-sex wedding, was recently passed by the Republican-controlled legislature.  Under the bill, faith-based groups could not be forced to hire or retain an employee whose beliefs run counter to the organizations, while churches and religious schools would have the right to reject holding events for people or groups to whom they object. Deal, a Republican, said he could not support the legislation, which had drawn wide criticism from corporations and had triggered threats of a state boycott by the entertainment industry. Deal said he was not bullied into his decision but felt a law was not necessary. I do not think that we have to discriminate against anyone to protect the faith-based community in Georgia, Deal said at news conference on the legislation, noting his religious faith. Similar bills in states such as Indiana and Arkansas sparked storms of criticism last year, forcing many lawmakers to retreat, and North Carolina is currently seeing protest over a new law that bars transgender people from choosing bathrooms consistent with their gender identity. Deals decision was immediately celebrated by gay rights advocates, including the national Human Rights Campaign. Our message to Governor Nathan Deal was loud and clear: this deplorable legislation was bad for his constituents, bad for business, and bad for Georgias future, HRC President Chad Griffin said in a statement. He added that Deal had set an example for other elected officials to follow. Mike Griffin, spokesman for the Georgia Baptist Convention, which lobbied for the bill, said his groups 1.3 million members will continue fighting for it. All we wanted was protection from government overreach, he said, noting his disappointment in Deal, a two-term governor. We feel that hes let down the people of faith and all of Georgia by not signing the bill.  Critics of the legislation included marquee Hollywood stars, such as Anne Hathaway and Julianne Moore, as well as movie and TV studios 21st Century Fox, NBC Universal, Time Warner, Walt Disney, AMC, Viacom and Marvel Entertainment. More than 300 large corporations and small businesses, including Delta Airlines and Coca Cola also came out against it.  Georgia is a welcoming state, Deal said. ",politicsNews,"March 28, 2016 ",1
"Trump questions NATO, Asia nuclear weapons ahead of Washington summit","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump on Sunday doubled down on his criticism of NATO, a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy for decades, and called for the alliances overhaul days before world leaders convene in Washington. President Barack Obama will host the Nuclear Security Summit on Thursday and Friday with 56 delegations in attendance. While preventing nuclear terrorism will headline the discussions, Trumps views could be a topic as well, particularly behind the scenes. In another sharp departure from historic U.S. policy, Trump said in an interview published on Sunday by The New York Times that he would consider letting Japan and South Korea build their own nuclear weapons, rather than rely on America for protection against North Korea and China. The billionaire businessman, vying to win his partys nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election, also said he might halt U.S. purchases of oil from Saudi Arabia and other Arab allies unless they commit ground troops to fight Islamic State or pay the United States to do so. NATO is obsolete, Trump said on ABCs This Week with George Stephanopoulos. The 28-country North Atlantic Treaty Organization was set up in a different era, Trump said, when the main threat to the West was the Soviet Union. It was ill-suited to fighting terrorism and cost the United States too much, he added. We should readjust NATO ... it can be trimmed up and it can be, uh, it can be reconfigured and you can call it NATO, but its going to be changed, he said. On March 21, Trump said the United States should slash its financial support for NATO, which was formed in 1949 after World War Two and became a bulwark against Soviet expansionism.  Russia will not attend the upcoming nuclear summit, but Chinese President Xi Jinping will.  Obama said the United States would review international efforts to combat Islamic State in the wake of the Brussels attacks. Trumps chief rival for the Republican nomination, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, called the real estate moguls views on NATO catastrophically foolish. Speaking on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace, Cruz said Trump was out of his depth. Abandoning Europe, withdrawing from the most successful military alliance of modern times, it makes no sense at all, Cruz said. It would hand a massive victory to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, a massive victory to ISIS, the militant group also known as Islamic State. Cruz said if he were elected president, his approach to Islamic State would be to carpet bomb them into oblivion. In the interview, Trump also said he would be willing to withdraw U.S. troops from Japan and South Korea unless the two countries paid more to house and feed them. Japan hosts about 50,000 U.S. troops, while 28,500 are in South Korea. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference in Tokyo on Monday that there had been no change to Japans policy of not building, possessing or introducing nuclear weapons, and reiterated that no matter who became U.S. president, the U.S.-Japan alliance would remain the core of Japans diplomacy and vital for regional and world stability. South Korea said it had continued to play a positive role in the U.S. militarys presence in the country and for the allies ability to defend against the North and there was no change to its commitment to the mutual defense treaty establishing their military partnership. Asked about the comments on considering allowing Japan and South Korea to build their own nuclear weapons, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said he had noted it was only a hypothetical situation.

Sanders says party leaders may 'rethink' after wins,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fresh from Democratic presidential primary wins over the weekend in three U.S. states, Bernie Sanders said on Sunday he had  political momentum that could help him win the backing of Democratic power brokers in his race against Hillary Clinton. Sanders easily won nominating contests in Alaska, Washington and Hawaii on Saturday. His latest remarks reflect his plan to chip away at Clintons commanding lead in the number of delegates needed to win the partys nomination for the November election. Interviewed on Sunday by U.S. broadcasters, Sanders said Democratic super-delegates, who can change their allegiance, might face pressure to rally behind him because most polls suggest he has a better chance than Clinton of beating a Republican candidate. Momentum is with us, Sanders, a senator from Vermont, said on CNNS State of the Union news program. A lot of these super-delegates may rethink their position with Hillary Clinton. Sanders also criticized Clintons reliance on wealthy donors to fund her campaign. He cited a fundraising dinner being hosted next month by actor George Clooney, where supporters will have to donate at least $33,400 to attend, or $353,400, nearly seven times the annual median income, if they want premium seating. It is obscene that Secretary Clinton keeps going to big money people to fund her campaign, Sanders told CNN. Our events, we charge $15 or $50 for people to come.  So, its not a criticism of Clooney. Its a criticism of a corrupt finance system. About 85 percent of the votes at the July 25-28 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, where a party nominee will be chosen to face the Republicans in the Nov. 8 election, are being determined by state nominating contests. The other 15 percent is held by party power brokers who are free to vote as they like, meaning they could hold the key in a tight contest. Super-delegates include party leaders and elected senators, members of the U.S. Congress and governors.  After Saturdays contests, the former secretary of state led Sanders by just under 300 pledged delegates in the race for the 2,382 needed to be nominated.  Adding in the support of super-delegates, which the party created in the early 1980s to give leaders more control over the nominating process, Clinton had 1,712 delegates to 1,004 for Sanders, according to a tally by RealClearPolitics.com. The U.S. senator from Vermont needs to win up to two-thirds of the remaining delegates to catch Clinton, who will keep piling up delegates even when she loses under a Democratic Party system that awards them proportionally in all states.   Sanders is turning his attention to his native New York, where Democratic voters will divide up 247 delegates on April 19th. His campaign manager on Sunday wrote a letter to Clintons manager insisting that a planned televised debate between the candidates in April be held in the state, which Clinton represented as a U.S. senator for eight years. Jeff Weaver said in the letter that the Clinton campaign had resisted holding the debate in New York.   Is the Secretary concerned about debating before the people who twice elected her to the U.S. Senate? Weaver wrote. Spokesmen for Clinton did not respond to requests for comment.

Mexicans burn Donald Trump effigies in Easter ritual,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexicans celebrating an Easter ritual late on Saturday burnt effigies of U.S. Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump, whose anti-immigrant views have sparked outrage south of the American border. In Mexico Citys poor La Merced neighborhood, hundreds of cheering residents yelled death and various insults as they watched the explosion of the grinning papier-mch mock-up of the real estate tycoon, replete with blue blazer, red tie and his trademark tuft of blond hair. Media reported that Trump effigies burned across Mexico, from Puebla to Mexicos industrial hub Monterrey. The burning is part of a widespread Mexican Holy Week tradition where neighborhoods burn effigies to represent Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus Christ according to the Bible. The effigies are often modeled on unpopular political figures. Since he started his campaign and began talking about immigrants, Mexico, and Mexicans, I said Ive got to get this guy, said Felipe Linares, the artisan who crafted Trump and whose family has been making Judases for more than 50 years.  Trump, the front-runner to win the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election, has drawn fire in Mexico with his campaign vow to build a wall along the southern U.S. border to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs, and to make Mexico pay for it. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has said his country will not pay for the wall and likened Trumps strident tone to the ascent of dictators like Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Trump, who has also aroused concern among many in his own party with his proposals, has accused Mexico of sending rapists and drug runners across the border and vowed to increase fees on some Mexican visas and all border crossing cards to help make Mexico pay for the wall. Judas effigies are burnt in villages and towns in several Latin American countries such as Venezuela and in parts of Greece. Anthropologists say the practice serves a symbolic function to overcome divisions and unite communities around a common enemy.  Linares has also done mock-ups of corrupt former union leader Elba Esther Gordillo and President Enrique Pena Nieto, whose popularity has been hit by conflict-of-interest scandals and the disappearance of 43 students at the hands of corrupt police.

"U.S. Democrat Bernie Sanders wins Alaska, Washington, Hawaii caucuses","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders easily won nominating contests in Alaska, Washington and Hawaii on Saturday, chipping away at front-runner Hillary Clintons commanding lead in the race to pick the partys candidate for the White House. Sanders still faces a steep climb to overtake Clinton but the big victories in the West generated more momentum for his upstart campaign and could stave off calls from Democratic leaders that he should wrap up his bid in the name of party unity. Sanders appeared headed to victory margins of more than 50 percentage points in both Alaska and Washington, and led by about 40 points in Hawaii with some 90 percent of the results tallied there. We are making significant inroads in Secretary Clintons lead and ... we have a path to victory, Sanders told cheering, chanting supporters in Madison, Wisconsin. It is hard for anybody to deny that our campaign has the momentum. Clinton, the former secretary of state, has increasingly turned her attention toward a potential Nov. 8 general election showdown against Republican front-runner Donald Trump, claiming she is on the path to wrapping up the nomination. Heading into Saturday, she led Sanders by about 300 pledged delegates in the race for the 2,382 delegates needed to be nominated at the partys July convention in Philadelphia. Adding in the support of superdelegates - party leaders who are free to back any candidate - she has 1,690 delegates to 946 for Sanders. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, needs to win up to two-thirds of the remaining delegates to catch Clinton, who will keep piling up delegates even when she loses under a Democratic Party system that awards them proportionally in all states. These wins will help him raise more funds for the next few weeks but I dont think it changes the overall equation, said Democratic strategist Jim Manley, a Clinton supporter. Hillary Clinton has too big a lead. But Sanders has repeatedly said he is staying in the race until the convention, pointing to big crowds at his rallies and high turnout among young and first-time voters as proof of his viability. After raising $140 million, he has the money to fight on as long as he wants. He has energized the partys liberal base and young voters with his calls to rein in Wall Street and fight income inequality, a message that resonated in liberal Washington and other Western states. Sanders won in Utah and Idaho this week. Dont let anybody tell you we cant win the nomination or the general election, Sanders told supporters in Wisconsin, which holds the next contest on April 5. We are going to do both. All three contests on Saturday were caucuses, a format that has favored Sanders because it requires more commitment from voters. They also were in states with fewer of the black and Hispanic voters who have helped fuel Clintons lead. He was just more aligned with my values. I am young and I never knew there could be someone like him in politics, said Samantha Burton of Seattle, who said Sanders was the first candidate who had inspired her to make a donation. Jocelyn Alt, a birthing assistant at a Seattle hospital, said she backed Clinton because she believed the times called for someone who could get things done. She knows how to make things happen, she said. I think Hillary is more likely to win against a Republican. After Wisconsin, the Democratic race moves to contests in New York on April 19 and a bloc of five states in the Northeast, led by Pennsylvania, on April 26. There were no contests on Saturday in the Republican race featuring Trump and rivals U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich. On Saturday, the New York Times published a lengthy foreign policy-focused interview with Trump. The New York billionaire told the newspaper he might stop oil purchases from Saudi Arabia unless they provide troops to fight the Islamic State. Trump also told the Times he was willing to rethink traditional U.S. alliances should he become president. ",politicsNews,"March 26, 2016 ",1
Trump would consider halting U.S. oil purchases from Saudis: NYT,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump told the New York Times he would consider stopping U.S. oil purchases from Saudi Arabia unless the Saudi government provide troops to fight Islamic State. Trumps comment on Friday was included in a lengthy foreign policy interview published by the newspaper on Saturday and came in response to a question about whether, if elected president, he would halt oil purchases from U.S. allies unless they provided on-the-ground forces against Islamic State. The answer is, probably yes, Trump said, according to a transcript. Trump has said the United States should be reimbursed by the countries it provides protection, even those with vast resources such as Saudi Arabia, a top oil exporter. And yet, without us, Saudi Arabia wouldnt exist for very long, Trump told the Times. ... Were not being reimbursed for the kind of tremendous service that were performing by protecting various countries. Now Saudi Arabias one of them. Trump also named in the interview retired Major General Gary Harrell, Major General Bert Mizusawa and retired Rear Admiral Charles Kubic as additional foreign policy advisors to the five named earlier this week who were criticized as obscure.  Trump has faced questions about his reluctance to reveal who was advising his campaign. He told the Times he was willing to rethink traditional U.S. alliances should he become president.

"Trump's investment funds lose money, billionaire unfazed","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trumps presidential campaign is built on his business acumen. But some of the Wall Street funds that he has invested in have proven less successful, underperforming industry benchmarks in the last 15 months, according to a Reuters examination. Eighteen out of 21 hedge funds and mutual funds in Trumps portfolio lost money in 2015, and 17 of them are down so far this year, according to public disclosures and private performance data seen by Reuters. The funds managed by Paulson & Co, BlackRock Inc, Baron Capital and others lost an average of 8.5 percent last year, according to Reuters calculations, whereas stock market and hedge fund industry benchmarks broke even or came close to it. Trumps funds are down another 2.9 percent so far this year, underperforming many benchmarks again. The performances in part reflect broader weaknesses in the investing climate. The last 15 months have been difficult for many portfolio managers amid volatile stock markets, tumbling oil and commodity prices, and an economic slowdown in China. Trump defended his holdings in an interview with Reuters, saying he invested in the funds three or four years ago and they have done well over time. I put some money with people that are friends, the New York businessman said by phone on Monday, without naming names. I have no idea if they are up or down. I just know that they have been very good over a period of time, added Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination for the November presidential election. Representatives for Baron, BlackRock and Paulson declined to comment. To be sure, some of Trumps funds have performed well this year. For instance, Gabelli Funds GAMCO Global Gold, Natural Resources & Income fund, a closed-end vehicle, has gained 16.27 percent through March 22, beating a benchmark return of 15.89 percent for natural resource funds, according to net asset value data from Morningstar. Another fund that Trump has invested in, the Invesco European Growth Fund, gained 4.82 percent last year versus a benchmark loss of 5.66 percent, according to Morningstar. Gabelli and Invesco declined to comment. Both funds are listed as small holdings within Trumps broader brokerage accounts.     The 21 funds examined by Reuters were among 23 funds that Trump disclosed last year in a July 15 filing with the Federal Election Commission. The performance of two of the funds could not be discerned. The Reuters review included performance data publicly disclosed by 14 mutual funds, as well as performance data on seven hedge funds seen in confidential fund reports or shared by people familiar with those firms. Trump told Reuters the funds are a tiny part of his investment portfolio. I do very little hedge funds business. I for the most part dont believe in it, he said. The 23 funds were worth as much as $120.75 million, according to the FEC filing, a fraction of Trumps self-proclaimed net worth of more than $10 billion.  While Trump selected the funds, their managers are responsible for choosing securities to invest in and the funds subsequent performance.  Some investing experts who looked at Trumps portfolio and Reuters compilation of their performance were not impressed, saying he could have earned better returns by investing in other hedge funds.  For instance, Reuters previously reported that Millennium Managements main Millennium International fund gained 12.65 percent in 2015, while Citadel gained 14.3 percent in its main multi-strategy hedge funds. By the looks of it, Mr. Trumps investing prowess is very pedestrian, said Brian Shapiro, chief executive of Simplify LLC, which tracks and analyses alternative investments like hedge funds. For someone who prides himself on being surrounded by the best talent, added Brad Alford, an investment advisor and CEO of Alpha Capital Management, Im surprised to see so few winners.  To be sure, some of Trumps funds that fell in 2015 have fared better in previous years. For instance, BlackRocks Obsidian fund has averaged annual returns of 3.39 percent over the last five years, according to a person familiar with the performance. Obsidian fell 6.17 percent in 2016 through March 11, while other comparable funds rose 0.69 percent, according to a private client report by HSBCs Alternative Investment Group seen by Reuters. BlackRock declined to comment. You cant measure it in a short time. Im way up with BlackRock. Im way up with Obsidian, Trump told Reuters, without elaborating further.  Trump disclosed a $27.6 million stake in Obsidian in May 2015, his largest fund holding. It is unclear when Trump first invested in Obsidian, which bets on corporate and government bonds, along with interest rates and other securities.  Obsidian was burned by a slide in oil and other commodities, according to a February BlackRock client note seen by Reuters. Trumps stable of funds include two Angelo, Gordon & Co hedge funds, three Paulson & Co hedge funds, and 11 Baron Capital mutual funds. The mutual funds are open to virtually anyone, but hedge funds are only accessible to those that meet minimum wealth requirements, which typically include a net worth of more than $1 million. A representative for Angelo, Gordon & Co did not respond to a request for comment. Barons billionaire founder, Ron Baron, is known for long-term bets on companies and an optimistic world view. Trump uses 11 Baron vehicles with different investment strategies, including small-cap stocks, real estate and emerging markets. Nine of the funds lost money in 2015, with one energy and resources vehicle falling nearly 32 percent, according to data compiled by Morningstar. Nine are down this year through March 22 with single-digit losses.   Barons long-term track record is better. The firms best-known Baron Growth Fund has gained an average of about 8.6 percent annually over the last five years.  Paulsons funds have produced a mixed performance in recent years. Led by New York billionaire John Paulson, the firm became famous for its prescient bet on the collapse of the subprime mortgage market leading up to the financial crisis.  But in 2015, the three Paulson funds used by Trump all fell, according to data provided by an investor to Reuters. One of the funds, the Paulson Advantage Plus fund, had declined an average of about 22 percent every year over the last five years, according to a confidential fund report seen by Reuters. Trump's filing to the FEC lists myriad business ventures, including holdings in hotels and golf properties, as well as individual stocks such as Apple Inc, Goldman Sachs and Altria Group. (Click here ) Trump told Reuters his stock picks have done well recently. I bought them low and I sold them high, he said, referring to a series of sales in January 2014 that netted more than $27 million.  It was very good timing, he added. I hit the market exactly perfectly. ",politicsNews,"March 24, 2016 ",1
"Republicans Cruz, Trump spar over tabloid charges of affair","WASHINGTON - Republican Ted Cruz on Friday denounced an article in the National Enquirer tabloid claiming he had extramarital affairs as complete and utter lies and accused rival Donald Trump of being the source of the story. The story took the Republican presidential race to a new level of personal rancor and Trump issued a statement saying he was not responsible for it. I have nothing to do with the National Enquirer and unlike Lyin Ted Cruz I do not surround myself with political hacks and henchman and then pretend total innocence, Trump said. Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, addressed the Enquirer story at a news conference in Wisconsin, saying, Let me be clear. This National Enquirer story is garbage. It is complete and utter lies. Its tabloid smear and it is a smear that has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen. Trumps statement pointed to other articles the Enquirer, a tabloid known for its gossip and unflattering celebrity photos, had been correct about in the past. Ted Cruzs problem with the National Enquirer is his and his alone, and while they were right about O.J. Simpson, John Edwards, and many others, I certainly hope they are not right about Lyin Ted Cruz, the billionaire New York developer said. Trump and Cruz have sparred in recent days about their wives as they battle to be the Republican nominee in the Nov. 8 election. Earlier this week Trump accused Cruz of posting a nude photo of Trumps wife, Melania, on Twitter. Cruz denied having any role in the photo being circulated on the Internet and Trump responded by threatening to spill the beans on Cruzs wife. Cruz said the Enquirer story was evidence that Trump is unfit to be president. This man would be an embarrassment, he said. The Enquirer published blurred images of five women with whom it said Cruz has had affairs but did not name them. Two women who appeared to be pictured in the Enquirer stepped forward on Friday and called the article false. The National Enquirer could not immediately be reached for comment on the story. Cruz wife, Heidi Cruz, was campaigning with him on Friday and he gave her a hug and kiss before he began a town hall event. She sat off stage smiling while he spoke. This is not the first time a presidential candidate has been accused of extramarital sex. During the 1992 campaign, Gennifer Flowers came forward to detail an affair she had with Bill Clinton. Subsequently, more women admitted to having affairs with him, including then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Former Colorado Senator Gary Hart, a Democrat, had his 1988 presidential campaign derailed when reports surfaced that he was having an affair. Former North Carolina Senator John Edwards admitted to having an affair with a campaign photographer during his 2004 campaign, although the public did not learn about the romance until after he was defeated. The Enquirers Cruz story exploded on the social media site Twitter overnight on Thursday. By Thursday afternoon, #CruzSexScandal was a worldwide trending topic on Twitter.

"As tensions escalate, Cruz calls Trump a 'sniveling coward'","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The feud between Republican presidential contenders Donald Trump and Ted Cruz over their spouses heated up on Thursday, with Cruz calling the party front-runner a sniveling coward for threatening his wife on Twitter. The senator from Texas also sharpened his attacks on Trumps conservative credentials, linking the brash billionaire to disgraced New York politicians Eliot Spitzer and Anthony Weiner. Cruz continued bashing Trump for making Cruzs wife, Heidi, a target of social-media barbs. I have to say, seeing him go deeper and deeper into the gutter, its not easy to tick me off, Cruz said at a news conference while campaigning in Dane, Wisconsin. But you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, itll do it every time.  Donald, youre a sniveling coward, Cruz said. Leave Heidi the hell alone. Cruzs remarks were the latest burst of hostility between the two camps, which earlier this week erupted into full view when Trump accused Cruz of posting a nude photo of Melania Trump on Twitter. Trump responded by threatening to spill the beans on Cruzs wife, Heidi.    Cruz denied having anything to do with the image, which was part of an attack by an anti-Trump Super PAC, Make America Awesome.  Donald, real men dont attack women. Your wife is lovely, and Heidi is the love of my life, Cruz said in a post on Twitter earlier on Thursday. Cruzs tweet followed one moments earlier by Trump in which he retweeted an image featuring a less-than-flattering picture of Heidi Cruz juxtaposed with a glamorous photo of Melania. The back-and-forth was too much for Senator Lindsey Graham, a former presidential candidate, who blasted both men in an interview on NBCs Today show on Thursday.    Talk about things that people really care about, and knock this crap off because these are serious times, and youre not behaving like you want to be president of the United States, he said.  For Trump, attacking another candidates wife may carry some political risk.  Half of U.S. women say they have a very unfavorable view of the billionaire businessman, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling in March. Cruz fared better, with 24 percent of the 5,000 women surveyed saying they had a very unfavorable view of him. The Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton, did worse than Cruz but better than Trump, with 36 percent of women polled saying they had a very unfavorable view of her. The poll had a credibility interval of 2 percentage points. Also on Thursday, Cruz began to press Trump on his history of supporting Democratic politicians in New York, which holds its Republican primary on April 19. And while Manhattan is home to Trumps business empire, Cruz spent time there this week campaigning. In media releases and social-media postings, Cruz highlighted Trumps history of donating not only to Spitzer, New Yorks former governor who resigned amid a prostitution scandal, and Weiner, the former U.S. congressman who quit after tweeting lewd images of himself, but also to other New York liberals such as U.S. Representative Charles Rangel, Senator Chuck Schumer, and New Yorks current governor, Andrew Cuomo.  The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment, but Trump posted an Instagram video that showed former Republican presidential candidates Carly Fiorina and Graham expressing doubts about Cruz earlier in the campaign. Both have since endorsed Cruz, saying he is in the best position to halt Trumps march toward the nomination. Both Trump and Cruz are trying to garner enough delegates to win the Republican nomination ahead of the partys convention this summer. After Tuesdays contests in Arizona and Utah, Trump had 739 of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination, according to The Associated Press. Cruz had 465. Polls show Trump leading in New York ahead of its primary. And there were also indications on Thursday of Trumps strength in California, where many observers believe he could clinch the nomination by winning its primary on June 7. A new survey by the Public Policy Institute of California found that among likely Republican primary voters, Trump led with 38 percent to 27 percent for Cruz and 14 percent for Ohio Governor John Kasich. The next Republican contests will be on April 5 in Wisconsin and on April 9 in Wyoming. ",politicsNews,"March 24, 2016 ",1
"Factbox: 'Carpet-bomb' ISIS, audit the Fed. What a President Cruz would do","(Reuters) - Presidential candidate Ted Cruz says he is the most consistent conservative left in the Republican race. The senator from Texas promises to cut taxes, slash regulations, crack down on illegal immigration and stick up for gun owners if he wins the White House. Here is a look at how Cruz has pledged to handle major issues should he become the Republican nominee and then win the Nov. 8 election. The policies are drawn from a review of his website, stump speeches, debates, legislative proposals and televised interviews. Cruz would boost border security by completing 700 miles (1,130 km) of priority fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border, tripling the number of Border Patrol agents and adding aircraft for border surveillance. He would rescind President Barack Obamas executive orders on immigration, which allow certain undocumented immigrants to stay in the country without fear of deportation. Cruz would ramp up deportations and would expand U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention space in the United States. He would withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities that do not prosecute undocumented immigrants. The candidate would end birthright citizenship, in which children born in the United States are automatically citizens. Cruz introduced legislation placing a moratorium on accepting Syrian refugees and letting states opt out of accepting refugees. He supports prioritizing Syrian Christians for refugee status. Cruz opposes the Export-Import Bank, which finances U.S. exports. He opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement, saying in a March debate that the United States is getting killed in international trade. He voted against giving Obama fast-track authority to secure the TPP, which Cruz said became enmeshed in backroom political deals. Cruz would abolish the Internal Revenue Service. He would establish a flat personal income tax of 10 percent, keeping deductions for charitable contributions and mortgage interest payments and the Child Tax Credit. He would eliminate the corporate income tax and payroll taxes, replacing them with a flat business tax of 16 percent that critics say resembles a value-added tax. Cruz would repeal the healthcare plan commonly known as Obamacare, and would eliminate other regulations. He would audit the Federal Reserve and move to a rules-based monetary policy. Cruz would repeal the Iran nuclear deal, and would recognize Jerusalem as Israels capital. He has said he would carpet bomb the Islamic State militant group. Cruz has said he would oppose efforts to oust foreign dictators, which he says create power vacuums and enable terrorists. ",politicsNews,"March 25, 2016 ",1
Biden makes the case for Obama's Supreme Court nominee Garland,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Joe Biden on Thursday ramped up White House efforts to get a Senate confirmation hearing for Supreme Court selection Merrick Garland, as the U.S. vice president offered the most vigorous defense yet of his 1992 comments that senators should not consider a nominee in a presidential election year. Senate Republicans have used Bidens 1992 comments as ammunition for their opposition to holding hearings on any Supreme Court nominee until Obamas successor takes office next January after the Nov. 8 presidential election. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reiterated that position after Obama on March 16 selected Garland, an appellate judge and former prosecutor, to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13. Biden spoke at Georgetown University law school, seeking to increase pressure on Republicans to allow confirmation hearings and a vote. Biden emphasized Garlands moderate record and that Republicans previously had suggested Garland would be a consensus Supreme Court candidate. In June 1992, when the possibility existed of a retirement on the nine-member court, then-Senator Biden declared on the Senate floor that if a vacancy occurred that election year, Republican President George H.W. Bush should not put forth a nominee until after the November presidential election. If Bush did so, Biden added, the Senate Judiciary Committee should seriously consider not scheduling confirmation hearings on the nomination until after the political campaign season is over. Biden, then chairman of that committee, was speaking hypothetically and no vacancy materialized. He said on Thursday his words 24 years ago had been selectively quoted by Republicans. He noted that he made them a year after the contentious 1991 confirmation of Justice Clarence Thomas and that they were intended to address the dangers of nominating an extreme candidate without proper Senate consultation. Biden scoffed at Republicans current reference to a Biden rule, meaning no hearing in a presidential election year. He said no such rule exists. Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley, the current Judiciary Committee chairman, accused Biden of trying to rewrite history on the 1992 remarks. While the vice president and others have tried to recast his 1992 speech as merely a call for greater cooperation, Grassley said, they neglect to mention that such cooperation, according to Chairmen Biden, was to occur in the next administration, and only after the presidential election. In a Quinnipiac University poll of 1,451 registered voters released on Thursday, 62 percent said the Senate should consider Garlands nomination rather waiting for a new president; 33 percent said senators should wait.

"Factbox: Increase defense spending, lower individual tax rate. What a President Kasich would do","(Reuters) - Presidential candidate John Kasich, the governor of Ohio and a former congressman, has positioned himself as a conservative Republican who is nonetheless willing to listen to all sides in order to solve problems. Kasich is challenging outsiders Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who is known for antagonizing his party, as an alternative who can win the partys support in the July convention ahead of the Nov. 8 election. These policies are drawn from his website, statements made at debates and interviews. Kasich has said it is silly to think the United States could round up more than 11 million undocumented immigrants and send them back to their home countries.  While he does not support a path to full citizenship for undocumented immigrants, Kasich believes the focus of immigration policies should be keeping families together and creating a path to a legal status for those already in the country who are working and have not committed violent crimes, including establishing a guest worker program.  Kasich does believe this should be underpinned by sealing U.S. borders and has said he would support building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Im a free trader, Kasich said in a January presidential debate, saying he supported both the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  He has supported granting the president authority to fast-track trade deals in the past. He has opposed withdrawing from the World Trade Organization. Kasichs top priority is a balanced budget and he did a national balanced budget tour last year; his presidential campaign events often have a clock with numbers ticking upward, tracking the level of national debt.  Kasich has pledged to cut taxes for individuals and families and increase the Earned Income Tax Credit, along with eliminating the estate tax. Kasich would also like to lower taxes and create incentives for those who create jobs, including by lowering the top business tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent.  Under Kasichs tax plan, the highest individual tax rate would be lowered to 28 percent from 39.6 percent. He has said he would launch a top-to-bottom review of the Internal Revenue Service to eliminate inefficiencies.  Kasich wants to increase defense spending by $102 billion. He has called for a no-fly zone over Syria and a combat coalition to fight the Islamic State militant group.  He has said the Syrian refugee crisis is a fundamentally European problem, but the United States should play a role. He believes the United States should pause accepting Syrian refugees and that there should be stringent checks. ",politicsNews,"March 25, 2016 ",1
"Factbox: End deportations, reform tax code. What a President Clinton would do","(Reuters) - Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton has moved to the left in key policy areas such as trade during her primary campaign against rival U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is known for his liberal stances. Here is a look at what the former secretary of state has said she would do should she win the White House in the Nov. 8 election. These policies are drawn from white papers released by her campaign, stump speeches, debates and interviews. Clinton supports comprehensive immigration reform with a path to full citizenship. She has pledged to defend President Barack Obamas executive actions on immigration and, if legally possible, expand on them. She has called for an end to deportation raids and family detentions.  Clinton has, however, disagreed with liberal Democrats about the best way to handle the influx of young people fleeing cartel violence and other issues in Central America.  Obama said in 2014 that the United States would send these youths back to deter others from attempting the same dangerous journey  a position that Clinton has defended, including in a recent presidential debate. The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border, Clinton said. I think now what Ive called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child, so that the right decision, hopefully, can be made. Clinton supports some free-trade agreements and opposes others, saying her decisions are based on whether she feels the specific agreement will adequately protect the interests of U.S. workers.  Clinton has had to deal with the legacy of the North American Free Trade Agreement reached by her husbands administration during her own political career. She backed away from NAFTA when she ran for a U.S. Senate seat representing New York.  As a senator, she supported trade agreements with Australia, Chile, Morocco, Oman and Singapore. She opposed the Central American Free Trade Agreement. During her first presidential campaign in 2008, she criticized possible agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea. But once she became Obamas secretary of state, she worked to finalize agreements with Colombia and South Korea  a deal that in 2007 she had called inherently unfair. Clinton also worked on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as secretary of state, saying it would be the gold standard of trade agreements.  As a presidential candidate in 2015, she stalled on taking a position on TPP, saying she would wait until it was finalized by the administration. Clinton eventually said she would not support TPP because it does not adequately protect U.S. workers. Clinton has pledged to not raise taxes on the middle class in any way, in contrast to Sanders, her Democratic rival, who favors a nominal income tax premium to fund universal healthcare. Clinton has focused on reforming the tax code so the wealthiest pay their fair share. She has proposed ending the carried interest loophole that categorizes the bulk of a hedge fund managers income as return on investment and not compensation; enacting the Buffett Rule so the wealthy with investment income do not pay lower effective tax rates than truck drivers or nurses; and pushing back against quarterly capitalism and incentivizing long-term investment by Wall Street. Clinton has called for an intelligence surge to combat the Islamic State militant group, and diplomatic efforts feature prominently in most of her foreign policy plans. She does not believe there should be a surge in ground troops in the Middle East, including in Syria. She has said she supports increased specialized forces there and enforcing a no-fly zone. She believes Russias participation will be essential for any solution in Syria. Clinton has also called for stepped-up efforts by U.S. technology companies to combat terrorism. In a major foreign policy speech she said social media companies can also do their part by swiftly shutting down terrorist accounts so they are not used to plan, provoke or celebrate violence. She has not said how far she would go to compel the cooperation of private companies in this effort. ",politicsNews,"March 25, 2016 ",1
"Factbox: Break up big banks, end free-trade agreements. What a President Sanders would do","(Reuters) - Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has made income inequality and Wall Street main themes of his campaign for the Democratic nomination to run for president in November.  Here is a look at some of his policy proposals, taken from his website, news stories and interviews. Sanders would expand the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and the Deferred Action for Parents of America program to extend legal protections given to certain immigrants who entered the country illegally. He would establish a whistleblower visa program for workers reporting labor violations. Sanders would end both for-profit and family detention of illegal immigrants. He would reform immigration laws, and would include a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants currently in the country. The candidate would protect the border with technology such as high-grade cameras, thermal imaging and movement sensors instead erecting of a border wall. Sanders would reverse trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Central American Free Trade Agreement. He opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade agreement. He would make it easier for people to join labor unions. Sanders says that permanent normal trade relations with China have been disastrous. He has called for U.S. companies to invest more in the United States. Sanders would seek the breakup of the largest financial institutions and reinstatement of Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era banking law that forced a separation of commercial and investment banking businesses. He would raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020. Sanders would tax Wall Street speculation to help fund free public college and university tuition, and would establish a progressive estate tax for those who inherit more than $3.5 million. He would set up a $1 trillion infrastructure investment program. The candidate would lift the cap on taxable income above $250,000 to expand Social Security benefits. Sanders supports the Iran nuclear deal, and opposes the use of ground troops in Iraq and Syria.  He would close the Guantanamo Bay detention center, and would move toward normalizing relations with Cuba. ",politicsNews,"March 25, 2016 ",1
Role of tech who set up Clinton's server unknown to bosses at State,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Soon after Hillary Clintons arrival at the State Department in 2009, officials in the information technology office were baffled when told that a young technician would join them as a political appointee, newly disclosed emails show. The technician, Bryan Pagliano, was running the off-grid email server that Clinton had him set up in her New York home for her work as secretary of state. But even as years passed, Paglianos supervisors never learned of his most sensitive task, according to the department and one of his former colleagues. Paglianos immediate supervisors did not know the private server even existed until it was revealed in news reports last year, the colleague said, requesting anonymity because of a department ban on unauthorized interviews.  Clintons decision to side-step the official state.gov email system has since shrouded her campaign for the U.S. presidency this year in controversy and legal uncertainty. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is conducting one of several inquiries into the arrangement, which saw classified information passing through her unsecured clintonemail.com account. The newly disclosed emails show Patrick Kennedy, the departments under secretary for management, oversaw the hiring of Pagliano. But Clinton and the department continued to decline this week to say who, if anyone, in the government was aware of the email arrangement. There was no permission to be asked, Clinton said earlier this month. State Department spokesman John Kirby declined to say whether this was correct, citing the ongoing inquiries. Before joining the department, Pagliano had worked on Clintons unsuccessful presidential campaign the previous year, and Clinton paid him separately to maintain the server, her campaign staff have said.  Pagliano is cooperating with the FBI in exchange for a promise of a form of prosecutorial immunity, but it remains unclear whether even he knew Clinton was using the server for her work as the nations most senior diplomat.  Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon declined to answer questions, but said in an email he was glad that Pagliano was speaking with the FBI because there was nothing inappropriate about the IT services he provided. The department gave copies of the emails to the Senates Republican-led Judiciary Committee, which is investigating the email arrangement, and they are cited in a five-page letter that the committee chairman, Senator Chuck Grassley, sent last week to Kennedy, who remains the departments most senior manager. Kennedy shared Paglianos rsum in 2009 with Susan Swart, then the head of the departments Bureau of Information Resource Management and chief adviser to the secretary on the departments information technology systems, and her deputy, Charlie Wisecarver.  How did the conversation go and have you reached an arrangement? he asked them, referring to Pagliano, in another email, according to the letter the committee shared with Reuters. Wisecarver and Swart, who had worked in the department for decades, were soon swapping emails expressing confusion and surprise that a political appointee, a so-called Schedule C employee who is more commonly hired to work in the secretary of states offices, should be joining the IT departments ranks. Schedule C employees, who help presidential appointees and agency heads make policy, can only report to people appointed by the U.S. president or other senior executive officials. But no one like that worked in the IT office, so Kennedy ended up being Paglianos designated supervisor.  The department told Reuters that Pagliano and Kennedy had little contact, and that Kennedy was unaware of the server or his subordinates role in running it. Nor did Wisecarver, Paglianos day-to-day boss, or Swart know, according to the former colleague, who said the IT office should have been informed.  People who worked with Pagliano did not respond to messages. Paglianos lawyer declined to comment. Grassleys letter also indicates that at least some department officials had learned of the servers existence by the end of the second year of Clintons tenure. Pagliano received an IT security briefing in late 2010 or early 2011 in connection with his work on the Secretarys non-government server, according to Grassleys letter.  Grassleys staff, who have been interviewing officials as part of their inquiry, declined to provide more details. The State Department declined to confirm whether the meeting happened.

Former Kentucky state lawmaker sentenced to seven years for bribery,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - A former Kentucky lawmaker received a seven-year prison sentence on Thursday for bribing an inspector to overlook violations at his coal mining companies, his attorney said. Former state Representative W. Keith Hall, 56, who was convicted in federal court in June 2015 of paying $46,000 over a five-year period to former mining inspector Kelly Shortridge, was also fined $25,000, said his attorney, Brent Caldwell.  Prosecutors said at Halls trial in Lexington that most of the funds were funneled from Halls companies to a shell company the two men created in the name of Shortridges wife. Shortridge reached a plea agreement and testified against Hall. He is slated to start his 24-month sentence next week. According to court documents, sentencing guidelines for Hall called for more than eight years in prison. His attorneys argued a sentence closer to the minimum 6-1/2 years was more appropriate. Caldwell said on Thursday an appeal was still possible, adding his client disagreed with the verdict. Hall, a Democrat, served 14 years in the Kentucky General Assembly before losing a primary election in May 2014. His indictment came five months later. His companies listed in the indictment included Beech Creek Coal Co, LLC & HEI Services LLC. ",politicsNews,"March 24, 2016 ",1
NY court dismisses suit to block Cruz White House bid,"ALBANY, N.Y. (Reuters) - A New York appeals court on Thursday upheld a lower courts dismissal of a suit seeking to remove Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz from the states primary ballot because of his Canadian birth. The New York Appellate Division agreed with the lower court ruling that the suit should be thrown out because it missed the  deadline for filing an objection to Cruzs appearance on the April 19 ballot. Lawyers for Cruz successfully argued that the objectors had filed their petition nearly three weeks late. The appeals judges said they would not address the merits of the case, saying they were academic. Roger Bernstein, alawyer for the petitioners, said his clients intend to appeal the decision. New York residents Barry Korman, 81, of Manhattan, and William Gallo, 85, of Manhasset, had filed the suit, arguing that because Cruz was born in Canada, he is not a naturally born citizen as the Constitution dictates for a U.S. president. Cruz has defended himself against similar claims in multiple states, saying he was a U.S. natural born citizen at birth because of his mothers U.S. citizenship at the time. Cruz was born in 1970 in Calgary, Alberta. ",politicsNews,"March 24, 2016 ",1
South Carolina governor urges U.S. to divert plutonium from Japan,"TOKYO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley has written to U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz demanding a shipment of weapons-grade plutonium en route to her state from Japan be turned back or sent elsewhere, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters. The demand has the potential to embarrass the Obama administration a week before it hosts an important summit on nuclear non-proliferation and undermine what so far has been viewed as a success in keeping weapons-grade material safe. The ship loaded with weapons-grade plutonium left Japan for a Department of Energy site in South Carolina on Tuesday in what is the largest such shipment of the highly dangerous material since 1992, the environmental group Greenpeace said.  The shipment puts South Carolina at risk for becoming a permanent dumping ground for nuclear materials, Haley said in the letter dated March 23. Therefore, stop shipment or re-route this defense plutonium. God bless.   A representative for the U.S. Department of Energy said it is reviewing Haleys letter but cannot comment on matters under active litigation. The state has sued the department over the federal governments plans to scrap a plutonium recycling plant that has been under construction for years in the state. The dispute comes as Washington prepares to host the Nuclear Security Summit March 31 to April 1.  The plutonium being shipped was supplied by the United States, Britain and France for the government-owned Japan Atomic Energy Agencys Fast Critical Assembly research project in Tokai Mura, according to the International Panel on Fissile Materials. The agreement to transfer the material to the United States was reached in March 2014 at a previous non-proliferation summit, the panel said on its website.  A South Carolina-based environmental advocacy group said the shipment only exacerbates the plutonium storage and disposition problems at the departments Savannah River Site, a 310-square mile (500 square kilometers) area bordered by the Savannah River and Georgia. The U.S. Government has done a poor job of explaining why this material is being taken to SRS, Tom Clements, director of SRS Watch, said in a statement.    The 331 kilograms (730 pounds) on board the British-owned Pacific Egret is only a tiny proportion of the nearly 50 tonnes  (55 tons) of plutonium held by Japan. Japan wants to use the plutonium extracted from spent fuel in nuclear plants as fuel for modified reactors. But with nearly all the countrys units still shut down in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster five years ago and no schedule for further restarts there is little use for the material. Only a few reactors can take plutonium as fuel. A homegrown reprocessing plant being built in northern Japan, which has relied on the British and French to extract plutonium from spent uranium fuel rods, also has the potential to add to the stockpile, although its start has been repeatedly delayed. The plutonium being shipped, enough to make about 50 nuclear weapons, was taken from the nuclear research center in the port town of Tokai Mura near Tokyo, for transport to South Carolina. The website www.vesselfinder.com said the ship is a nuclear fuel carrier.     Shipments of plutonium are highly sensitive because it can be used in nuclear weapons or to make a so-called dirty bomb. In Japan, public sensitivity is also high because it is the only country that has been attacked with nuclear bombs. Japan is also the only nation without atomic weapons with significant amounts of plutonium, which has led to constant criticism from neighboring countries, scientists and others.      China, a nuclear weapons state, this week said Japan should abide by its non-proliferation obligations. Japan is still stockpiling a large amount of other sensitive nuclear materials, including separated plutonium and highly enriched uranium. This certainly is an issue for the international community to be concerned about, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Tuesday.      Thomas Countryman, an assistant U.S. secretary of state in charge of non-proliferation, has called into question the renewal of an agreement between Washington and Tokyo that allows Japan to reprocess and produce weapons-grade plutonium.  The agreement is due to be extended in 2018, but with a new U.S. administration starting in January its status is unclear. We think that there are genuine economic questions where its important that the U.S. and its partners in Asia have a common understanding of the economic and non-proliferation issues at stake before making a decision about renewal of the 1-2-3 Agreement, for example, with Japan,Countryman told a Senate hearing last week.

U.S. frustration simmers over Belgium's struggle with militant threat,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Shortly after last Novembers attacks on Paris by a Brussels-based Islamic State cell, a top U.S. counter-terrorism official traveling in Europe wanted to visit Brussels to learn more about the investigation. When the official tried to arrange meetings, however, his Belgian counterparts were not welcoming, according to U.S. officials familiar with the events. The Belgians indicated it was a bad time to speak to foreign officials as they were too busy with the investigation, said the officials, who asked not to be identified. Belgian officials declined to comment on the incident. The brush-off was one small sign of mounting U.S. frustration over Brussels handling of its worsening Islamic militant threat.  Concern that the small European nations security and intelligence officials are overwhelmed  and that its coordination with allies falls short  have again come to the fore following the Islamic State-claimed attacks on Tuesday that killed at least 31 people. Several U.S. officials say that security cooperation has been hampered by patchy intelligencesharing by Brussels and wide differences in the willingness of different agencies to work with foreign countries, even close allies. One U.S. government source said that when American investigators try to contact Belgian agencies for information, they often struggle to find which agency or part of an agency might have relevant information. Belgium has ordered a sharp increase in security budgets following the Paris attacks, despite being under steady pressure to limit its debt levels under euro zone rules. The government has promised to recruit around 2,500 more federal police, who pursue major crimes, to make up for a shortfall of close to a fifth of the full-strength force of 12,500. It also says it thwarted a major attack in January 2015, and is eager to cooperate with European and U.S. counterparts. These attacks show that more coordination with the United States is clearly desirable, Guy Rapaille, the president of the committee that provides oversight of Belgiums security and intelligence services, told Belgiums state broadcaster RTBF. But you have to remember that big powers guard their intelligence very closely.  U.S. officials acknowledge the recent Belgian efforts to step up funding and recruitment. Yet they say Belgian security services are outmatched by the threat in a country that, per capita, has supplied the highest number of foreign fighters to Syria of any European nation. Theyre way behind the ball and theyre paying a terrible price, Rep. Adam Schiff, ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told Reuters. Asked on Wednesday whether Belgium was too complacent over the threat posed by Islamic militancy, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said:  I want to stay clear of saying that Belgium was somehow caught by surprise or not aware.You know, we collaborate, we work with Belgium closely.  Some U.S. counter-terrorism officials say much of the gap between Washington and Belgium  and some other European countries  is cultural. Europeans deeper commitment to personal privacy sometimes prevents or delays sharing of information such as travel data  that is taken for granted in the United States. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. government radically reshaped its counter-terrorism agencies. It broke down walls between law enforcement and intelligence authorities, and created new coordinating institutions such as the Director of National Intelligence and National Counterterrorism Center. Belgium, by contrast, is a patchwork country divided between French and Dutch speakers and with multiple levels of government. Belgian security chiefs have repeatedly complained that they cannot handle up to 900 home-grown Islamist militants, among the highest per-capita rates in Europe. Belgium does not divulge the exact number of personnel in its security services and military intelligence, but security experts say they appear under-resourced compared to European counterparts. Add to that the problem of two languages (French and Flemish), lack of Arabic speakers, and weak coordination between national and local government, you have a huge discrepancy between threat and response, said former CIA official and White House advisor Bruce Riedel, now at the Brookings Institution.

"U.S., Germany eye ways to deepen cyber collaboration","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior U.S. and German officials agreed this week to deepen their collaboration on a range of cyber issues, including working to promote norms for responsible state behavior in cyberspace and expanding training in developing countries. The two governments underscored their shared strategic goals in a joint statement issued Thursday after a two-day annual bilateral meeting on cyber issues. Christopher Painter, cyber coordinator for the U.S. State Department, said the two countries already worked together closely in many areas, including law enforcement, human rights and other areas, but the fourth annual talks were focused on a broader, whole-of-government approach. Having this annual discussion ... brings all the agencies together and its a good way to take stock and make sure were going in the right direction and thinking about how we can collaborate even further, he told Reuters in an interview. Ties between Germany and the United States remain strong despite tensions that flared after documents released by whistleblower Edward Snowden in 2013, which showed the National Security Agency had spied on German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Painter said he had spoken in Germany many times since that incident and Washington had not shied away from engaging Germany on the issue of surveillance and privacy. But he said it was not hampering cooperation and collaboration in other cyber areas. This is something that we continue to address and we take seriously, he said. At the same time ... we cant let that discussion, as important as it is, divide us and detract us from talking about all the other issues we have in common and the long-term goals we have.  Painter said the two sides welcomed a consensus 2015 UN Group of Governmental Experts report which affirmed that international law applied in cyberspace, and adoption of additional confidence-building measures. Germany planned to continue working for wider adoption of cyber norms in its role as the new chairman of the 57-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation (OSCE), he said. Given limited personnel and resources, the two countries also planned to share information on their training work in Africa, Latin America and other parts of the developing world.   We all have limited resources, so its very helpful for us to share what were doing so were not all training the same three guys in a country. The next bilateral cyber dialogue will occur in Berlin in 2017. ",politicsNews,"March 24, 2016 ",1
N.C. governor signs bill repealing Charlotte transgender bathroom law,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - North Carolinas governor on Wednesday signed into law a measure that blocks local governments in the state from enacting ordinances to allow transgender people to use public bathrooms that match their gender identities. The legislation came in response to such a provision approved last month in Charlotte, the states largest city, as part of an expanded nondiscrimination ordinance that also added protections for marital and familial status, sexual orientation, gender expression and gender identity. The bill passed both chambers of the legislature during a one-day special session convened in Raleigh to address the Charlotte law. Republican Governor Pat McCrory, who signed the bill late on Wednesday, said the Charlotte measure defies common sense. The basic expectation of privacy in the most personal of settings, a restroom or locker room, for each gender was violated by government overreach and intrusion by the mayor and city council of Charlotte, McCrory said in a statement. Controversy over the bathroom component echoed similar fights across the country as transgender advocates push for the right to choose restrooms and locker rooms, including in schools, based on gender identity rather than birth gender. Republican lawmakers in North Carolina warned that the radical Charlotte measure would create a public safety issue by giving men, including sex offenders, access to womens bathrooms if allowed to take effect on April 1. This is a common sense bill that protects the privacy expectations of our citizens while clarifying local authority, said Republican Representative Paul Stam. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy groups condemned the laws passage and said they were exploring legal challenges. They say no public safety risks had resulted in the more than 200 U.S. cities that have enacted protections similar to those passed in Charlotte. We are disappointed that Governor McCrory did not do right by North Carolinas families, communities, and businesses by vetoing this horribly discriminatory bill, said Chris Brook, legal director of the states American Civil Liberties Union. The bill requires multiple-occupancy bathrooms and locker rooms in public schools and government buildings to be used by people only according to their biological sex. The measure also creates North Carolinas first statewide nondiscrimination policy for public places, including restaurants, hotels and taxis. But it limits the protections against discrimination to race, religion, color, national origin and biological sex. Local governments would be prohibited from passing anti-discrimination ordinances that extended the protections to include gender identity and sexual orientation. ",politicsNews,"March 23, 2016 ",1
"Trump's tariff plan could boomerang, spark trade wars with China, Mexico"," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps threats to slap steep tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports may have won him votes in Republican primaries but they would likely backfire, severely disrupting U.S. manufacturers that increasingly depend on global supply chains.  The Republican presidential front-runners campaign pledges to impose 45 percent tariffs on all imports from China and 35 percent on many goods from Mexico would spark financial market turmoil and possibly even a recession, former trade negotiators, trade lawyers, economists and business executives told Reuters.  I dont mind trade wars when were losing $58 billion a year, Trump said in a Feb. 25 debate, referring to the 2015 U.S. goods trade deficit with Mexico. Economists dispute the idea the United States is losing money as the trade deficit is simply the difference between what the United States imports and what it exports to a country.  ""Imposing tariffs or putting up trade barriers may sound good, but it will hurt our economy and credibility,"" said Wendy Cutler, the former acting deputy U.S. Trade Representative who helped lead U.S. negotiations in the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal last year.  Among those hardest hit would be the U.S. auto industry, which has fully integrated Mexico into its production network. Some $118 billion worth of vehicles and parts flowed north and south across the border tariff-free last year, according to U.S. Commerce Department data.  A 35 percent tariff would raise costs for Ford Motor Co's U.S.-assembled F-series and medium-duty pickup trucks that use Mexican-made diesel engines, one of its most profitable vehicle lines. (Graphic on U.S.-Mexico auto and parts trade: tmsnrt.rs/1UN3wun)  Ford CEO Mark Fields on Wednesday defended the companys investment strategy, which includes $9 billion for U.S. plants over the next four years, saying, We will do what makes sense for the business.  Buyers of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NVs popular Ram 1500 pickup trucks assembled in Saltillo, Mexico, could see their $26,000 base price pushed up by $9,000 if the tariff is fully passed on to consumers. A Chrysler spokesman declined to comment on Trumps statements.  Trumps campaign said in a statement that U.S. trade policy constitutes unilateral economic surrender and needs complete change because it allows foreign competitors to shut out U.S imports, devalue their currencies and unfairly target U.S. industries.  I dont think he does our issue any favors by making it so incredibly jingoistic and bombastic, said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a group that allies domestic steelmakers and other manufacturers with the United Steelworkers union.  But I believe theres widespread agreement ... that there is something amiss with our economic relationship with China and its past time that our government pushes back a little more forcefully.  It would take years for U.S. industry to rebuild supply chains devastated by sudden tariff hikes on Chinese and Mexican goods and any retaliatory measures, said Peter Petri, a Brandeis University professor who has co-authored an influential study on the effects of the TPP trade deal on national income.  Even if U.S. firms were able to make such a transition, Petri said this would likely result in a permanent annual reduction in U.S. national income of more than $100 billion, or 0.8 percent.  Trumps tariff plans would effectively violate NAFTA and revoke U.S. commitments to the World Trade Organization, say trade lawyers.  Beijing and Mexico City are just going to retaliate on the things that are likely to hurt us most, said Susan Schwab, the U.S. Trade Representative from 2006 to 2009 in the George W. Bush administration. Schwab negotiated major portions of free trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama.  In 2009, Mexico slapped duties up to 25 percent on more than 90 different U.S. farm goods, from pork to frozen potatoes due to foot-dragging by U.S. lawmakers on allowing Mexican truckers on to U.S. roads, as specified under NAFTA. The National Potato Council estimates that U.S. growers lost about $70 million in revenue over 31 months, a 50 percent cut from their third-largest export market.  Mexicos economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo said last week that big tariffs on Mexico would return the United States to an isolationist, xenophobic and protectionist vision.  And a full-scale tariff war with China would likely expose the largest U.S. export sectors to steep duties, including aircraft, semiconductors, corn and soybeans, trade lawyers said.  Retaliatory tariffs would also hurt growing U.S. vehicle exports to China - at 300,000 a year now equivalent to the annual output of a large assembly plant. General Motors Co is now planning to import a Buick sport-utility vehicle from a Chinese joint venture plant.  A GM spokesman declined to comment.  Chinas state-run Global Times newspaper called Trump big-mouthed, anti traditional and abusively forthright in an editorial, but did not directly address his tariff proposals.  A long-running U.S.-China trade dispute over solar panels illustrates how tariffs can sometimes cause unanticipated damage.  In 2012, the U.S. Commerce Department slapped anti-dumping duties of up to 78 percent on Chinese solar panels after German-owned SolarWorld AG complained that below-cost Chinese imports were hurting its U.S. production.  China responded with its own 57 percent duties against U.S. producers of polycrystalline silicon, the raw material for photovoltaic cells. This put the brakes on an industry that was fast expanding to meet demand from Chinese solar panel makers.  Hemlock Semiconductor, controlled by Dow Corning, abandoned construction of a $1.5 billion new polysilicon plant in 2014. Dow Corning spokesman Jarrod Erpelding said Hemlock serves as a strong example of how trade disputes often have unintended consequences.  This is really stupid, said Francine Sullivan, chief legal officer of REC Silicon in Moses Lake, Washington, which halted production this year. The necessity and value in putting on tariffs to protect solar panels in the U.S. was just not thought through. Weve suffered enormous financial damage as a result of this.  The Trump campaign said measures like tariffs would level the playing field and help bring millions of manufacturing jobs back to the United States.  But Durwin Oodie Royal, a furnace operator at U.S. Steel Corps Lone Star Tubular Operations in Texas, knows first-hand that such relief can be temporary.  Workers at the plant cheered when the United States imposed anti-dumping duties on Chinese drilling pipe in 2009 and 2011. But the company announced on Friday that it would temporarily idle the tube mill, laying off 450 workers as it battles a slump in U.S. oil and gas drilling, a continued global steel glut and unfairly traded imports.  When they slap tariffs on one country, the imports just come in from another country, said Royal, who expects to be among those workers who are idled.  After the tariffs were imposed on China, South Korean imports surged, he said. Right now, were just limping along like everybody else.  ",politicsNews,"March 24, 2016 ",1
From Russia with love: why the Kremlin backs Trump,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Donald Trump is a brave pro-Putin political maverick who would end U.S. foreign wars and perhaps lift sanctions on Moscow. Hillary Clinton, however, is a warmonger beholden to the military-industrial complex.    Russian state TV, which hews closely to the Kremlins world view, leaves little doubt about who Moscow supports in Novembers U.S. presidential election: The Donald. Vladimir Putins spokesman took brief exception this month to a Trump attack video which showed Putin laughing at the prospect of Clinton defending America. But officials and analysts say the Kremlin still sees Trump as the best candidate by a mile. Putin has hailed Trump as very talented. The head of the Russian parliaments foreign affairs committee said hed be a worthy winner of the 2015 man of the year title in the United States. And Dmitry Kiselyov, presenter of Russias main weekly TV news show Vesti Nedeli, claimed this month that the Republican party elite had struck a secret deal with the Democrats to derail Trump, in part because of his sympathy for Russia.  Trump doesnt suit the Republican party, Kiselyov told viewers. They usually divide up the state budget (among themselves) by frightening people about Russia. But Trump is ready to find a common language with Putin. Thats why they dont need Trump and even regard him as dangerous. Kiselyov has been one of the chief proponents of state televisions strongly anti-American tone, once saying Moscow could turn the United States into radioactive ash. Some experts say Trump appeals to Moscow because Putin believes a Trump presidency would be isolationist and leave Russia with a free hand.    The Kremlin cant believe its luck, said Konstantin von Eggert, an independent Moscow-based political analyst who believes the Obama administration has not been forceful in countering Russia. President Obama and (Secretary of State) John Kerry were a dream team for them, but now they have an even better option; someone who thinks that America should have nothing to do with the rest of the world. RT, the Kremlins English-language TV channel formerly known as Russia Today, says it does not back any U.S. candidates. But it has described Trump as idiosyncratic and raw, and suggested he represents the popular will of U.S. voters, which a sinister U.S. establishment is trying to subvert. Can Americas elections be truly called democratic if the political establishment aligns itself against the popular will? lamented Peter Lavelle, the American host of RTs flagship talk CrossTalk show. As things stand now millions of voters could be disenfranchised. Trump has received advice from Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, a former U.S. military intelligence chief who advocates better ties with Russia, and who shared a dinner table in Moscow with Putin in December to celebrate RTs 10th anniversary. Trump has won friends in Moscow with statements praising Putin as a strong leader that he could probably get along with. His support for Russian air strikes in Syria was welcomed. In January, after a British judge ruled that Putin had probably authorized the murder of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko in London, Trump said he saw no evidence the Russian president was guilty. First of all, he says he didnt do it. Many people say it wasnt him. So who knows who did it? Trump said. This week, Trump said the United States should reduce funding for NATO. A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said his comments showed the alliance was in crisis. For the last two years all we heard from Western newspapers and TV was very critical of Russia, Victoria Zhuravleva, a Moscow-based expert on U.S.-Russia relations, told Reuters. So when you hear something that is not so critical and even more friendly towards your country its like: Thank God, Theres one person we can talk to: Donald Trump Trump and Putin were similar, she said: They are both open-minded, pragmatic, and say what they think. The mutual appreciation between Trump and Putin has invited comparisons to the Russian leaders friendship with another billionaire-turned-politician, Italys Silvio Berlusconi, who outraged Ukrainians and irked EU leaders last year by visiting Russian-annexed Crimea with Putin. They toured a Crimean winery and drank a priceless 240-year-old bottle from its cellar. By contrast, Hillary Clinton, who is well known to the Kremlin because of her 2009-2013 stint as U.S. Secretary of State, is clearly not to Moscows taste.  We really dont want Hillary, said one Russian official, who spoke anonymously because of the subjects sensitivity. Shes no friend of Russias. State media coverage has focused on what it has cast as her wacky promise to declassify UFO files and on the pressure she has faced for using her personal email account for government business and over her response to the fatal 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. Pro-Kremlin bloggers, corralled by a Putin supporter who used to represent the ruling party in parliament, are enthused by the prospect of agitating on behalf of Trump. Trump is the first member of the American elite in 20 years who compliments Russia. Trump will smash America as we know it, weve got nothing to lose, Konstantin Rykov told his followers on social media.  Do we want the grandmother Hillary? No. Maybe its time to help the old brigand.

Lawsuit against Trump model agency dismissed by U.S. judge," (This story corrects date of election to Nov. 8 from Nov. 3 in eighth paragraph) By Alana Wise WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit against Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trumps modeling agency, saying there was insufficient evidence a foreign-born model had been misled or was owed back pay. U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres found that Alexia Palmer had not provided proof that Trump Model Management LLC fraudulently applied for a U.S. visa for her or that she had been denied fair wages. Attorneys for both Palmer and the modeling agency could not be immediately reached for comment. Lawyers for Trump, who owns the agency but was not named directly in the suit, have called the case frivolous and without merit. Palmer, a Jamaica native, sued in October 2014, alleging    that for her three-year contract with the agency, she was promised a $75,000-a-year salary, but received just $3,880.75. She sought $250,000 in back pay. The lawsuit also alleged Palmers experience was part of a grander scheme to lure foreign models to the United States and cheat them out of their pay. But Torres said there was not enough evidence to prove that Palmer had worked the requisite number of hours over the three years to justify a minimum hourly wage complaint or warrant back pay. The cases dismissal was a setback for attorneys who sought to bring a class action against the agency on behalf of models. A group lawsuit could have drawn additional attention to Trumps employment of foreign-born workers as he seeks the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election.

Obama praises Argentina's 'man in a hurry' Macri for reforms,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday championed Argentinas new center-right leader Mauricio Macri as an example for other countries in Latin America, praising the fast pace of reforms to strengthen the economy. Obama, on a two-day visit to Argentina that marks a detente after years of tensions, said Argentina under Macri was poised to play a more influential role on the global stage.  In his first 100 days in office, Macri has distanced himself from South Americas leftist bloc, old allies of former President Cristina Fernandez, and sought a thaw in relations with Western capitals as he seeks new investment in Latin Americas No. 3 economy. I can tell you President Macri is a man in hurry, Obama told a joint news conference after the two leaders held talks. Im impressed because he has moved rapidly on so many of the reforms that he promised, to create more sustainable and inclusive economic growth, to reconnect Argentina with the global economy and the world community, he said. Macri offers Obama a new ally in South America, a region where a strong leftist bloc turned its back on Washington over the past decade but where public opinion is now shifting toward the political center as governments grapple with graft scandals and an economic slowdown. Argentina is re-assuming its traditional leadership role in the region and around the world, Obama said.   His trip to Argentina to forge a new friendship follows a historic visit to former Cold War foe Cuba that aimed to boost U.S. credibility across Latin America. For years, much of the region took a dim view of Washingtons longstanding policy of trying to force change on Communist-ruled Cuba by isolating it, a strategy that Obama has cast aside. Macri said Obamas visit marked the start of new mature relations in which the countries would cooperate on issues ranging from trade to fighting international drug trafficking. Macri has lifted capital and trade controls, slashed bloated power subsidies and cut a debt deal with holdout creditors in the United States. But he still has to grapple with double-digit inflation, a yawning fiscal deficit and a shortage of hard currency, and has made securing new foreign investment flows a priority. The American Chamber of Commerce in Argentina said  U.S. firms would invest $2.3 billion in Argentina over the next 18 months, including more than $100 million each from General Motors Co, Dow Chemical Co, AES Corp and Ford Motor Co. Argentine Finance Minister Alfonso Prat-Gay urged business leaders, at a forum where the new investment flows were announced, to think long-term and said policies aimed at cutting inflation and reinvigorating growth would be felt in the second half of the year. Weve cleaned out the rubbish, Prat-Gay said in reference to Fernandezs protectionist policies that stunted investment. Now were entering the starting gates. Obama said the two governments would work to identify barriers impeding greater trade flows between the two economies, adding that a free trade agreement was something that might lie at the end of the process. Right now theres a lot of underbrush, a lot of unnecessary trade irritants and commercial irritants that can be cleared away administratively and thats some of the work that we intend to do right away, Obama said. Foreign companies operating in Argentina routinely complain about costly customs requirements, cumbersome red tape and strong workers rights. Obama said Argentina could be an effective partner in the fight against drug trafficking and organized crime and said both countries would work together in response to the Zika virus that has spread across parts of South America at lightning speed. The two countries announced an agreement on joint steps to fight climate change including working to cut carbon emissions from air flights and integrating solar and wind power into electricity grids. Crowds have cheered Obamas motorcade as it travels along Buenos Aires tree-lined boulevards, handing the U.S. leader a friendlier reception than his predecessor George W. Bush, whose presence at a Summit of the Americas in 2005 was met with protests and snubbed by then President Nestor Kirchner. But left-wing political parties have promised protests on Thursday, which coincides with the 40th anniversary of the coup on March 24, 1976, that installed right-wing military rule.     In an era when Cold War thinking often put Washington behind right-wing governments in the region, the United States initially backed the 1976-1983 dictatorship, during which as many as 30,000 people were killed.  Obama said he would visit a memorial to victims of the Dirty War to pay tribute to the Argentines who stood up against human rights violations, and re-affirmed that his administration would declassify U.S. military and intelligence records related to the junta. I hope this gesture also helps to rebuild trust that may have been lost between our two countries, Obama said. ",politicsNews,"March 23, 2016 ",1
California Republicans lean to Trump but dislike candidate choices,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - About 38 percent of California Republicans support billionaire Donald Trumps bid for the U.S. presidency, but more than half  say they are not satisfied with their choices of candidates, a new opinion poll shows. The poll released by the Public Policy Institute of California on Wednesday also shows that among Democrats who are likely primary voters, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton leads U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont with 48 percent support compared with Sanders 41 percent. The survey also showed that California Democrats are much more likely to be satisfied with their presidential choices than Republicans. Among Democratic voters surveyed, 65 percent said they were satisfied with their choices of candidates, while just 46 percent of Republicans say they were satisfied with the field. Among independents, who make up nearly a quarter of registered voters in the most populous U.S. state, satisfaction with primary choices is even lower, at 34 percent.     Democrats, who make up 43 percent of registered voters in the state, break along age lines in their support for Clinton or Sanders, the poll showed. Voters aged 45 and older skewed heavily for Clinton at 63 percent, while the same percentage of voters below age 45 said they support Sanders. The U.S. presidential election is on Nov. 8. The PPIC poll showed an increase in support for Trump when compared with a poll by the Field Research Corporation in January. In that survey, Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas were in a statistical tie at roughly 25 percent each.  Since then, however, several candidates have dropped out of the crowded Republican race. Nationwide, Reuters polling conducted on Tuesday showed Trump with a commanding lead among Republicans at 44.6 percent. By comparison, 26.9 percent said they supported Cruz and 19.8 percent supported Ohio Governor John Kasich.   The PPIC poll of 1,710 adult California residents was conducted March 6-15, and has a margin of error of 3.6 percent. Polling ended on the night that U.S. Senator Marco Rubio dropped out of the race for the Republican nomination. ",politicsNews,"March 24, 2016 ",1
Phoenix mayor calls for probe of county's handling of presidential nominating vote,"PHOENIX (Reuters) - Phoenixs mayor on Wednesday urged a federal probe into the local countys handling of voting in Arizonas presidential nominating contest, questioning whether minority voters were granted a fair chance to cast their ballots. Greg Stanton asked the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate a decision by Maricopa County officials to slash the number of polling locations in Arizonas most populous county and leave minority-heavy areas with seemingly fewer sites. The Democratic mayor called the vote a fiasco after voters had to wait in line for several hours on Tuesday to cast their ballots. Donald Trump won the states Republican contest, while Hillary Clinton won on the Democratic side.  Because of the unacceptably disparate distribution of polling locations, I respectfully request the U.S. Department of Justice investigate what took place [...] to ensure all voters are treated equally, Stanton said in the letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch. He said it was the latest in a series of moves by county and state officials that had created a culture of voter disenfranchisement. Complaints of long waits at the polls  some as long as five hours - were common, with hundreds of voters still trying to vote long after the polls closed. There also were reports of polling stations running out of ballots. The countys top election official took the blame on Wednesday for making the cost-cutting decision to cut the number of polling sites to 60, compared with the 200 in 2012. County Recorder Helen Purcell said she underestimated the number of people who would vote, in part citing the rise in mail-in ballots. If we had to do it all over again, we would have done it differently, but I take the blame for that, Purcell told the county Board of Supervisors. We were not prepared, that was our fault. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey a Republican, said the long lines were unacceptable and called on election officials to evaluate what went wrong and what could be done to prevent a repeat.

Clinton: More Europe can do to help U.S. combat terrorism,"(Reuters) - Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said on Wednesday the attack in Brussels that killed more than 30 people is the latest brutal reminder that more must be done to defeat Islamic State militants, including by European Union member countries. In an address at Stanford University in California, Clinton said the United States and Europe should take a harder look at protocols at airports and other soft sites that are outside security perimeters.  Clinton also said there is much we can do to support our European partners but there is also more they can do to share the burden with us. Clinton said she would like to see more European countries investing in defense and security in the way Germany has during the Obama administration. The most urgent task is stopping the flow of foreign fighters to and from the Middle East who are citizens of France, Germany, Belgium and the United Kingdom with European passports that make it easier for them to cross into Syria and return radicalized, Clinton said. Clinton said that many European nations do not currently alert their neighbors when they turn away a suspected jihadist at their border or when a citizens passport is stolen. European Union countries also need to share traveler information more readily, Clinton said. Its actually easier for the United States to get flight manifests from EU nations than it is for EU nations to get them from their own neighbors, thanks to an agreement that the United States negotiated when I was secretary of state, Clinton said. Additional steps that could be taken in Europe are the creation of a new, unified, European border and coast guard to strengthen the external borders of a continent that is under unprecedented pressure from refugees and migrants, Clinton said. Clinton also praised past partnerships between the United States and Europe, calling the NATO alliance between North American and European countries one of the best investments that America has made. Republican front-runner Donald Trump has in recent days said that the United States should rethink its involvement in the decades-old alliance. Clinton also took aim at Trump, along with presidential rival U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, when she slammed offensive, inflammatory rhetoric that demonizes all Muslims, including those who could be partners in the fight against terrorism.

"Trump, Cruz trade barbs over wives in presidential race","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz turned to Twitter to defend their wives honor after a Super PAC put out an ad featuring Trumps wife nude and Trump threatened to spill the beans on Cruzs wife. Trumps threat came on Tuesday night when he was upset about an ad that showed his wife, former model Melania Trump, lounging nude with a caption saying, Meet Melania Trump. Your next first lady. Or, you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday. Trump said Cruz was behind the ad, which appeared on Tuesday, the day of nominating contests in Utah, where the heavily Mormon electorate favored Cruz in its caucuses, and Arizona, which gave Trump a victory in its primary vote. The ad said it was from Make America Awesome, a Super PAC that is allowed to promote a candidate but not coordinate with the campaign. Wow @SenTedCruz, that is some low level ad you did using a picture [of] Melania in a G.Q. shoot, Trump tweeted on Tuesday. Be careful or I will spill the beans on your wife.      Trump later deleted the tweet but published another that read: Lyin Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife! Trump did not indicate what kind of beans he intended to spill about Heidi Cruz, who is on leave from an executive job at Goldman Sachs while campaigning, but her husband quickly came to her defense on Twitter. Pic of your wife not from us, the U.S. senator from Texas said. Donald, if you try to attack Heidi, youre more of a coward than I thought. #classless. The battle continued on Wednesday with Cruz telling CNN: He went directly after my wife. If Donald wants to get in a character fight, hes better off sticking with me because Heidi is way out of his league.   A Twitter response from Trump questioned Cruz honesty. Lyin Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. Thats why we call him Lyin Ted! he said.  The director of Make America Awesome, Liz Mair, posted on Twitter that her group was responsible for the ad. She did not respond to an email from Reuters seeking comment. In a campaign appearance for her husband in Waukesha, Wisconsin, Heidi Cruz addressed the uproar briefly. You probably know by now that most of the things that Donald Trump says have no basis in reality, she told reporters. So we are not worried in the least. ",politicsNews,"March 23, 2016 ",1
Obama sees no Middle East peace deal before his presidency ends,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Wednesday he did not expect a breakthrough on Middle East peace before he leaves office and reiterated his support for a two-state solution in which Israelis and Palestinians could live peacefully side by side.  Speaking to students and teachers in Argentina, Obama said he expected to continue working on Middle East peace after he leaves office next January. The presidents comments came amid reports that his administration was considering a renewed push on the issue.  Obama conceded that despite his and others efforts, the decades-long dispute had not come closer to being resolved during his presidency. This is not something I was able to get done, he said. I am not that hopeful that its going to happen in the next nine months. Its been 60 years; its not going to happen in the next nine months. Having twice failed to achieve Israeli-Palestinian peace, the Obama administration is discussing ways to help preserve the prospect of an increasingly threatened two-state solution, U.S. officials said earlier this month. Despite his skepticism about progress anytime soon, Obama reinforced his commitment to that prospect. Theres been talk about a one-state solution or sort of a divided government. Its hard for me to envision that being stable, theres such deep distrust between the two peoples right now, he said. And the neighborhood is in such a mess that I continue to believe that a two-state solution is the best way. Now, over time that could evolve.   ",politicsNews,"March 23, 2016 ",1
Supreme Court faces 4-4 split in Obamacare contraception case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Wednesday headed toward a possible 4-4 split over a legal challenge by Christian nonprofit employers who object to providing female workers insurance covering birth control as required by President Barack Obamas healthcare law. An evenly split ruling, with the courts four liberals backing the Obama administration against the four conservative justices, would leave in place lower-court rulings rejecting challenges brought by the Christian organizations that oppose providing contraception coverage for religious reasons.  Justice Anthony Kennedy, who often casts the deciding vote in close cases, appeared more aligned with the courts three other conservatives in favoring the challengers, which primarily were Roman Catholic including the archdiocese of Washington. The Christian employers call contraception immoral and argue that the government should not compel religious believers to choose between following their faith and following the law. They argue they should get the complete exemption from the mandate already given to places of worship such as churches, mosques and temples. Kennedy said if religious employers were forced to comply with the contraception mandate they would be in effect, subsidizing the conduct that they deemed immoral. Only eight justices heard the latest high-profile conservative challenge to the law, considered Obamas signature legislative achievement, following conservative Justice Antonin Scalias Feb. 13 death. The court heard 90 minutes of arguments in the case, Zubik v. Burwell, on the sixth anniversary of Obama signing into law the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. The law has expanded medical insurance coverage to millions of previously uninsured Americans. Conservatives have mounted numerous legal challenges to the law. The Supreme Court in 2012 and 2015 issued high-profile rulings leaving Obamacare intact. The court heard arguments on seven consolidated cases focusing on whether nonprofit entities that oppose the requirement can object under a 1993 U.S. law called the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act to a compromise measure offered by the government. A ruling is due by the end of June.  A 4-4 split would set no national legal precedent against such claims, and would allow them in some parts of the country depending on lower-court rulings. The justices also potentially could order the case reargued. The Christian groups object to a 2013 compromise offered by the Obama administration that allowed groups opposed to providing insurance covering birth control to comply with the law without actually paying for the required coverage. Groups can certify they are opting out of the mandate by signing a form and submitting it to the government. The government then asks insurers to pick up the tab for  contraception. The challengers contend the accommodation violates their religious rights by forcing them to authorize coverage for  employees even if they are not paying for it. One question before the hearing was whether Kennedy would be more sympathetic to the government than he was in a 2014 case concerning the same contraception requirement. Kennedy was in the majority when the court ruled 5-4 that family-owned companies run on religious principles, including craft retailer Hobby Lobby Stores Inc, could object to the provision for religious reasons. Kennedy wrote a concurring opinion then saying an accommodation like the one now at issue could be acceptable. Nothing he said during Wednesdays arguments indicated he thinks the accommodation now before the court passes legal muster. The federal government asserts it has a compelling interest in protecting the health of female workers, and that contraceptive coverage is part of that. The challengers say the government has imposed a substantial burden on their religious rights and that the waiver is not the least restrictive means, as required under the religious freedom law, toward its goal. Kennedy questioned whether it would be difficult for the government to arrange alternative access to contraception coverage that would not force religious groups to be complicit. If its so easy to provide, if its so free, why cant they just get it through another (insurance) plan? Kennedy asked. Liberal justices raised concerns about giving nonprofit religious organizations the same exemptions churches get. Justice Elena Kagan said Congress might stop giving churches exemptions when it passes laws, posing a mortal danger to them. Liberal Sonia Sotomayor referred to the danger of widespread exemptions from government requirements, asking, How will we ever have a government that functions? Liberal Stephen Breyer said religious groups often contend with government decisions they oppose. He cited Quakers, who opposed the Vietnam War but were still required to pay taxes that funded military spending. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts said the challengers contention that the government was seeking to hijack their insurance plans in order to provide contraception coverage appeared to be an accurate description of what the government wants to do. Among other challengers in the case were: the Little Sisters of the Poor order of Roman Catholic nuns that runs care homes for the elderly; and Bishop David Zubik and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh.

Cruz gets Jeb Bush backing as Republican elites try to stop Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Ted Cruz won the backing of former rival Jeb Bush on Wednesday as prominent Republicans overcome their aversion to the conservative senator to try to force a standoff with insurgent Donald Trump at their partys convention in July. The endorsement by Bush, part of a Republican dynasty, is the latest sign of how keen the partys establishment is to stop Trump, fearing that his rhetoric on illegal immigration and national security will cost the party votes at the Nov. 8 presidential election.            Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, is a staunch social conservative and a divisive figure in the party due to his willingness to criticize the leadership and his prominent role in bringing about a 2013 government shutdown.  But he is still seen by party grandees and many Republicans in Congress as preferable to Trump, a real-estate billionaire viewed as straying even further from party orthodoxy. Republicans across the spectrum are realizing that to nominate Donald Trump brings chaos to our party and potentially to our country, U.S. Representative Trent Franks of Arizona told Reuters, and that any differences they might have had with Ted Cruz are far less important than the danger of nominating Mr. Trump. In his customary style, Trump took to social media to register his scorn, referring to the profligate spending by former Florida governor Bushs well-funded campaign and associated political fund-raising groups. I think having Jebs endorsement hurts Lyin Ted, ran a message on Trumps Twitter account. Jeb spent more than $150,000,000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first! Bush, who quit his campaign last month after a poor start to the primary season, sent a fund-raising email on Cruzs behalf to his supporters, urging them to help overcome the divisiveness and vulgarity of Trump. Cruz won the Republican caucuses in Utah on Tuesday but time is running out for him to defeat Trump before the Republican convention in July, and for Republican establishment figures to reassert control of a party that is being wrested away from it by rank-and-file voters. Cruz looked on track to win all of the 40 Republican delegates from Utah, although Trump won the 58 delegates up for grabs in Arizona, partly due to his tough message on illegal immigration.     After Tuesday, Trump had 738 of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination, according to The New York Times. Cruz had 463.  WRONG AND UN-AMERICAN On the Democratic side, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont won in two out of three states that voted for the partys nominee on Tuesday, but this made only a small dent in the lead held by Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, who won Arizona. President Barack Obama echoed his fellow Democrats on Wednesday by criticizing Cruzs call to carpet bomb Islamic State and for renewed calls from Cruz and Trump to increase the surveillance of Muslims in the United States after Islamic State suicide bombers killed at least 31 people in Brussels. To target Muslims in this way is not only wrong and un-American, Obama said in a news conference in Argentina, but it also would be counterproductive because it would reduce the strength, the antibodies that we have to resist the terrorism. The Bush endorsement put pressure on Ohio Governor John Kasich, who is struggling in third place in the Republican race, to drop out. Kasich was viewed as the only establishment candidate left, said U.S. Representative Matt Salmon of Arizona, a Cruz supporter. With the quintessential establishment candidate now endorsing Cruz, it makes Kasich irrelevant. People in Kasichs campaign suggested the candidate was paying no more attention to party elites than voters were, saying he planned to survive to the convention and wrestle the nomination there. In interviews, some Republican lawmakers and wealthy party donors worried a Bush endorsement was no longer a game-changer. U.S. Representative John Duncan of Tennessee said it would make a miniscule difference at most. Cruz remains undaunted, and added Bushs name to a list of prominent Republicans who had belatedly rallied to his cause, including Mitt Romney, the partys unsuccessful 2012 candidate. Across the spectrum Republicans are uniting, he told the crowd at a New York City campaign event.     ",politicsNews,"March 23, 2016 ",1

"Starbucks, Univision, Democracy Works aim to boost U.S. voter turnout","(Reuters) - Democracy Works Inc, a non-partisan, non-profit group trying to encourage more Americans to take part in elections, said on Wednesday it is joining forces with Starbucks Corp, Spanish-language television network Univision and others in an attempt to boost U.S. voter turnout to 80 percent by 2020.  The project, called the TurboVote Challenge, comes during one of the most contentious and unpredictable U.S. presidential races in many years, marked by strong participation in both Republican and Democratic primary elections and caucuses.  Democracy Works, which aims to create a more representative and inclusive democracy, said voter turnout had not been above  80 percent since 1888.  An estimated 57.5 percent of eligible citizens voted in the 2012 presidential election, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. The projects other founding partners include lodging web service Airbnb, Arizona State University, the Fusion TV network, ride-sharing company Lyft, news company Mic, online music service Spotify, email newsletter theSkimm, retailer Target Corp, mall operator Westfield Corp, shared workspace provider WeWork and the Video Game Voters Network.

Opponents of Cruz White House bid take case to N.Y. appeals panel,"ALBANY, N.Y. (Reuters) - Lawyers for two New York residents seeking to throw Ted Cruz off next months presidential primary ballot in the state urged an Appeals Court panel on Wednesday to consider whether the U.S. senator from Texas is eligible given his Canadian birth. The case put forward by New York residents Barry Korman, 81, of Manhattan and William Gallo, 85, of Manhasset, had been dismissed by a Supreme Court judge earlier this month because it was filed after a procedural deadline. Lawyers Roger Bernstein and Judith Hancock urged the five judges of the Appellate Division of New York to consider the merits of their case to block Cruz from the April 19 New York state primary election. The objectors attached Cruzs birth certificate showing he was born in December 1970 in Calgary, Alberta. Bernstein told the panel the primary ballot must only contain constitutionally eligible presidential candidates, and argued the appeals judges should give greater weight to the importance of the issue than the missed deadline. Their petition to block Cruz came 19 days beyond the three-day limit after a candidate files a request to be placed on the ballot, Cruzs lawyers said, adding that the objection should not go forward because it was tardy. Theappeals judges are expected to rule later this week. The case is one of several similar challenges to Cruzs eligibility to run for the White House - including lawsuits in Alabama, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Texas - filed since Republican front-runner Donald Trump brought up questions about whether Cruz meets the constitutional requirement to be president. The Constitution says that to be president, a person must be a natural-born citizen of the United States. Cruz has argued that he is eligible to run because of his mothers U.S. citizenship, and many legal experts say it is unlikely any judge in the United States would block his presidential bid. The lawyers representing the New York objectors are also representing the appeal of Carmon Elliott, who is complaining about Cruz being on the ballot in Pennsylvania.

"Pennsylvania budget to go into effect, ending long stalemate","(Reuters) - Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, said on Wednesday he would allow a Republican budget bill for fiscal 2016 to become law without his signature, ending nine months of stalemate that starved schools and social service agencies of funding. Due to the political gridlock, the state until now only had a partial spending plan in place for this fiscal year, which began on July 1. Wolf, who took office in January 2015, previously said he would veto the latest $30 billion budget bill. But on Wednesday he said he would let it become law to allow funding to flow to schools, some of which have said they could have to close within weeks without state aid. The move leaves the worst-rated U.S. state, Illinois, as the only one without an enacted budget for the current fiscal year. Earlier in March, Standard & Poors Ratings Services warned that it could downgrade Pennsylvanias AA- credit rating by the end of the month without an enacted budget that addresses the structural deficit. We still face enormous problems that this budget does not even pretend to address, he said in a statement, noting that the spending plan is still out of balance. Lets be clear: the math in this budget does not work. Next fiscal year - that already has a $2 billion deficit - will now begin with an extra $300 million deficit, he said. The announcement and additional $200 million of education funding in the budget come at a critical time as more schools are nearing the end of their financial rope, the Pennsylvania School Boards Association said in a statement. The group supported Wolfs efforts to increase education funding. His campaign promise to restore education funding by imposing a new tax on natural gas extraction met resistance in the Republican-led legislature. The association said the state should also reimburse school districts for interest payments on loans they had to take to stay open. Through December, when lawmakers finalized a partial spending plan, schools had borrowed about $1 billion with interest costs of up to $50 million. ",politicsNews,"March 23, 2016 ",1
Labor Department unveils controversial union 'persuader' rule,"(Reuters) - The Department of Labor on Wednesday released a long-awaited rule requiring companies to disclose when they seek advice about countering union campaigns, which several business groups vowed to challenge in court. The so-called persuader rule, first proposed in 2011, amends the federal Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act to require detailed reports from employers and their advisers, including the types of consulting or legal services rendered and any fees paid.  For more than 50 years, the reporting law required such disclosure from employers only when their lawyers or consultants interacted directly with workers.  The Department of Labor said in a memo accompanying the rule that workers would be better prepared to make decisions about unionizing if they knew who was behind their employers arguments. The rule is backed by major unions, including the Service Employees International Union and the AFL-CIO. Activities covered by the rule include hiring consultants or lawyers to create materials and policies for organizing anti-union campaigns or script managers communications with employees. The proposal has come under attack from groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, which say it would stifle employers free speech rights to counter union organizing, and the American Bar Association, which says it could interfere with attorney-client privilege. The rule is the latest salvo in the business communitys battle with the Obama administration over labor policy. Business groups compared the proposal with rules adopted last year by the National Labor Relations Board to speed up the union election process, saying both provide little benefit to workers while burdening employers.  Several business groups on Wednesday said they would probably sue over the persuader rule. They said it could discourage some companies from consulting lawyers at all, potentially leading them to commit inadvertent labor violations during union campaigns.  The DOL must have created this rule with the real intent of assisting organized labor because they are the only ones who stand to gain anything from this, said Robert Cresanti, president and chief executive officer of the International Franchise Association, one of the groups that says it is considering a court challenge. Pushback was also expected from Republicans in Congress. Representative John Kline of Minnesota, who chairs the House Education and the Workforce Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday that the rule was unfair because it did not impose the same disclosure requirements on unions.

Lawmakers say NSA plan to expand sharing data ‘unconstitutional’,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democratic and a Republican congressmen have asked the National Security Agency to halt a reported plan to share more raw intelligence data with other federal agencies, warning the policy shift would be unconstitutional and dangerous, according to a letter seen by Reuters. U.S. Representatives Ted Lieu and Blake Farenthold, who sit on the House Oversight Committee, said in a letter dated March 21 to NSA Director Michael Rogers that the proposal would violate Fourth Amendment privacy protections because the collected data would not require a warrant before being searched for domestic law enforcement purposes. If media accounts are true, this radical policy shift by the NSA would be unconstitutional, and dangerous, Lieu, a California Democrat, and Farenthold, a Texas Republican, wrote. The New York Times reported last month that the proposal would allow the NSA to share intercepted private communications with other U.S. intelligence agencies before applying any privacy protections to the data.  Bob Litt, general counsel of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, told the Times the Obama administration was finalizing a 21-page draft of the new permissible procedures. The draft has not been made public. Civil liberties advocates have interpreted the change as potentially allowing NSA foreign intelligence data, which sometimes can include collection of communications to, from or about Americans, to be used for domestic policing purposes. The NSA has said its analysts scrub out certain personal information before handing any communications data over to other agencies. Our country has always drawn a line between our military and intelligence services, and domestic policing and spying, the lawmakers wrote. We do not  and should not  use U.S. Army Apache helicopters to quell domestic riots; Navy Seal teams to take down counterfeiting rings; or the NSA to conduct surveillance on domestic street gangs. The executive branch is able to change its rules for some surveillance programs without congressional approval. Without a law from Congress, the government relies on executive order 12333, which was signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981 and later modified by President George W. Bush.  Critics have said the order is overly broad and vague. The NSA did not respond to a request for comment about the letter. Congress last year passed a law curtailing certain aspects of the NSAs surveillance authority, most notably ending its bulk collection of domestic phone records exposed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013.

"Trump, Clinton win big in Arizona, but Cruz, Sanders show fight","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican front-runner Donald Trump swept to victory in Arizona on Tuesday but rival Ted Cruz showed some fight with a win in Utah that gave hope to establishment Republicans who fear Trump would lead the party to ruin in the presidential election. On the Democratic side, favorite Hillary Clinton routed challenger Bernie Sanders in Arizona to stretch her advantage in the race for her partys presidential nomination. Sanders, however, won contests in Utah and Idaho to bolster his case that he still has a chance despite Clintons big lead. The nominating battles in Arizona and Utah, plus the Democratic contest in Idaho, were overshadowed by attacks in Brussels in which at least 30 people were killed and raised security concerns among U.S. voters. Trump helped himself in Arizona with a hardline anti-immigration message and tough talk on Islamic militants to easily defeat Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Trump had the backing in Arizona of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, one of the most prominent supporters of a crackdown on illegal immigrants. The win furthered Trumps argument that he will eventually win the Republican presidential nomination and that the party should rally around him. He won all of Arizonas 58 delegates. Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you, I will never forget! Trump said on Twitter. Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November, paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices! Cruz, though, won big in Utahs caucuses, giving hope to those Republicans who fear Trumps proposal to deport 11 million illegal immigrants and build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico would guarantee a Democratic victory in the Nov. 8 election. Cruz appeared to be on track to win all of Utahs 40 Republican delegates. Since the states 40 delegates are awarded proportionate to the popular vote, he needed to win at least 50 percent of the vote to take all the delegates. He appeared to benefit from Mormons who dominate the Republican vote in Utah. They did not take kindly to a Trump attack on native son Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee who has led the anti-Trump opposition. Trump had questioned whether Romney, an elder in the Mormon church, was really a Mormon. Trumps poor showing in Utah is a reminder that while many love his glib comments, those remarks can also have a downside.  Questioning Mitt Romneys faith is something that was sure to backfire in Utah, said David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University. Clinton seized on the Brussels attacks to argue that neither Trump nor Cruz can be trusted to lead the fight against Islamic State militants. Trump has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and Cruz said he would send police patrols into Muslim neighborhoods in the United States. This is a time for America to lead, not cower, Clinton told supporters in Seattle in a victory speech. Sanders said his Utah and Idaho victories were powered by young people and working-class Americans who support his political revolution.  These decisive victories in Idaho and Utah give me confidence that we will continue to win major victories in the coming contests, he said. Trump is trying to beat back efforts to deny him the nomination. His opponents want to stop him from securing the 1,237 delegates needed ahead of the July convention. Trump now has 678 delegates. I think it is going to be very hard for them to do, Trump said on CNN of any effort to deny him the nomination if he falls short. I have millions of votes more than anybody. Sanders is looking for wins in many of the six Democratic contests this week. Alaska, Hawaii and Washington will vote on Saturday. Clinton will keep adding to her delegate total even if she is not the winner in a given state because Democratic delegates are awarded proportionally in all states. Tuesdays Republican contests were the first since U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida dropped out a week ago after Trump drubbed him in his home state. Kasich is the only other candidate still in the race, splitting the anti-Trump vote with Cruz. ",politicsNews,"March 22, 2016 ",1
Trump says Muslims not doing enough to prevent attacks,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said Muslims were not helping to prevent attacks such as those that killed at least 30 people in Belgium, drawing a rebuke from Britains government and from Muslim groups in the country. In an interview broadcast on Britains ITV television on Wednesday, Trump was asked what his message was for British Muslims after Tuesdays bombings in Brussels and the attacks in Paris last November.  When they see trouble they have to report it, they are not reporting it, they are absolutely not reporting it and thats a big problem, Trump said. His comments were countered by British interior minister Theresa May who said he was just plain wrong to suggest Muslims in Britain were failing to report suspicious activity by extremists. Trump, the front-runner in the race to be the Republican candidate in Novembers presidential election, has made a series of controversial statements during his campaign. His supporters see him as someone who speaks uncomfortable truths but he has outraged many others in the United States and around the world. Trump, who has called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, said it was a disgrace that one of the suspects behind last Novembers attacks in Paris had been found after a long manhunt by police in an area of Brussels where he lived. He was in his neighborhood where he grew up and nobody even turned him in and supposedly this is retribution for that. Its a disgrace, he said. Trump said there were signs that an attack by suspected Muslim extremists in California in December, which killed 14 people, could have been stopped. A lot of people in the community knew they were going to do it because in their apartment they had bombs all over the floor ... and they didnt report them, he said. I dont know what it is. Its like theyre protecting each other but theyre really doing very bad damage. They have to open up to society, they have to report the bad ones. Britains May told parliament that Trump was mistaken. I understand he said that Muslims were not coming forward in the United Kingdom to report matters of concern. This is absolutely not the case - he is just plain wrong, she said.

Trump 'plain wrong' to say Muslims not helping on extremists: UK minister,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britains interior minister said U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was just plain wrong to say that Muslims in Britain were failing to report suspicious activity by extremists. I understand he said that Muslims were not coming forward in the United Kingdom to report matters of concern. This is absolutely not the case - he is just plain wrong, Theresa May said in Britains parliament. Earlier on Wednesday, Trump said in an interview with Britains ITV television that it was a disgrace that one of the suspects behind last Novembers attacks in Paris had been found in an area of Brussels where he lived. He also said people in the Muslim community in California had known in advance about an attack that killed 14 people in December.  ",politicsNews,"March 23, 2016 ",1
Jeb Bush endorses Ted Cruz for Republican nomination,"WASHINGTON(Reuters) - Former candidate Jeb Bush endorsed Ted Cruz for the Republican presidential nomination on Wednesday, saying the U.S. senator from Texas represents the partys best chance of winning the White House. In a statement, the former Florida governor called Cruz a consistent, principled conservative who has demonstrated an ability to appeal to voters and win primary contests. Washington is broken, and the only way Republicans can hope to win back the White House and put our nation on a better path is to support a nominee who can articulate how conservative policies will help people rise up and reach their full potential, Bush said. The 63-year-old Bush, whose father and brother served as president, dropped out of the presidential nomination fight after losing badly in South Carolina on Feb. 20. The endorsement comes as establishment Republicans scramble to stop front-runner Donald Trump from winning the nomination because of his divisive proposals like a plan to deport 11 million illegal immigrants. Cruz has run in second place behind Trump and could conceivably win enough Republican delegates to take the nomination. Ohio Governor John Kasichs lone path to the nomination is to extend the nomination race until the partys national convention in July. The idea is to deny Trump the required 1,237 delegates needed and force party leaders to consider someone else. A source close to Bush said Bush picked Cruz because he has the most viable path to the nomination and has shown that he can win states. The source said Bush considers a push for a contested convention to be a hail-Mary strategy at best. In the weeks after he withdrew, Bush met in Miami with former rivals Cruz, Kasich and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Rubio dropped out of the race after losing Florida last week. Bush spoke by phone to Cruz on Monday. In his statement, Bush resumed his sharp criticism of Trump, saying Republican voters must move to overcome the divisiveness and vulgarity that Trump has brought into the political arena or we will certainly lose our chance to defeat the Democratic nominee and reverse President (Barack) Obamas failed policies. To win, Republicans need to make this election about proposing solutions to the many challenges we face, and I believe that we should vote for Ted as he will do just that, Bush said. In a statement, Cruz said Bushs endorsement is further evidence that Republicans are continuing to unite behind our campaign to nominate a proven conservative to defeat Democratic favorite Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election.

"For 'Apprentice' insiders, Trump's 2016 bid has echoes of reality TV","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump had come to a run-down New York City apartment on a fall day in 2003 to tape a scene for his new reality television show, The Apprentice. Suddenly, one of the contestants cried out in surprise.  The young woman, Omarosa Manigault, had been struck in the head by a piece of plaster dislodged from the ceiling by a microphone boom. She immediately blamed the mishap on another contestant. As Trump watched, every camera in the room shifted to capture the outburst, one of those moments that are the lifeblood of reality television, a former crew member recalled. Fast-forward to 2016: As a presidential candidate, Trump talks often about turning the cameras. He creates moments of great drama during his rallies by pointing out television  cameramen and accusing them of refusing to show the size of his crowds. Turn the camera! he chanted at a Michigan rally last year. The crowd of 9,000 joined him until a roar filled the room and exploded into cheers as the cameraman finally swung hiscamera to show the crowd. Such scenes have become commonplace. Trumps 2016 White House run is built in part on drama and controversy, a campaign that former cast and crew members of The Apprentice said appeared to draw lessons from reality TV, especially one: how to grab the publics attention and keep it. Trump denied in an interview that he had learned any tricks from the show. His success on television, he said, came from a natural instinct. But those involved in The Apprentice said Trump the candidate is not all that different from the contestants on the dog-eat-dog elimination game show, where 14 people engaged in a series of business-related challenges to win a job at Trumps real estate company. At the end of each episode, Trump would appear with the contestants in an executive boardroom and eliminate one with his trademark, Youre fired. A producer on the shows first season, Bill Pruitt, said he believed Trump had learned, by watching and refereeing fights among the contestants, how they defended or went after one another. Pruitt said he had seen Trump evolve on the show, honing his ability to get candidates to turn on one another, one of the hallmarks of the show. He learned, as time went on, how to do that, how to speak and create reactions, said Pruitt, who is not supporting Trumps presidential run. The campaign is much different than a show, Trump responded, rejecting the idea that his campaign bore any resemblance to reality television. Long before the debut of The Apprentice, the New York businessman was a regular fixture in the pages of his hometowns daily newspapers, which covered his fights with other real estate developers and celebrities like Rosie ODonnell. But The Apprentice gave him a truly national platform for the first time, and he saw how his blunt and unfiltered style helped make the show a major hit. At its peak, nearly 21 million people watched the show, which ran for 14 seasons and has still not been canceled by NBC. I havent changed. The Apprentice didnt change me. I think I changed The Apprentice, Trump told Reuters, asserting that he had come up with the idea to say, Youre fired.  And he dismissed intensifying criticism that his presidential campaign thrives on conflict. Im not looking for conflict. With the show its a little bit different. Yet Trump has dominated media coverage of the election in a way that has little modern precedent in American politics, and he has done that mostly by saying or doing something that makes people angry. His barrage of insults in Twitter battles with opponents, including fellow Republican candidates, has delighted many supporters, who regularly tell pollsters they like the billionaire because he says what he thinks and doesnt hold back.  His claim that Mexico was sending rapists over the U.S. border enraged the Mexican government; his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States prompted widespread international condemnation, as did his call for killing the families of terrorists and torturing terrorism suspects.  Mike DeMatteo, who worked on The Apprentice as a sound mixer for nearly a decade, said it would have been hard for Trump not to have drawn lessons from the show. When youre sitting back and watching it and seeing the reaction in the press as it evolved, you get a very good gauge of what people are talking about, who they like, what they dont like, he said. Youre really starting to understand the people out there.  DeMatteo described himself as a Trump fan but said he disapproved of some of his recent comments. The place whereApprenticecontestants could battle for fame was the boardroom. Boardroom scenes found Trump seated at the head of a long polished wood table, criticizing contestants work. Contestants worked in teams, so Trumps questions were often about which team member was to blame for mistakes. He would ask a lot of very to-the-point questions, he would put people on the spot, he would get information about contestants that would make the other ones mad at them, recalled DeMatteo. Michael Tarshi, 36, a Boston-based real estate developer and a contestant on Season 3, has first-hand experience of this. During one boardroom scene in Season 3,Trumplistened as members of a team described their roles in a failed project. Trump then asked one of the members, Bren Olswanger, whom he would fire. Olswanger named team-mate Stephanie Myers, setting off an argument between the two contestants. When Tarshi tried to interject, Trump cut him off:Michael let me ask you a question. Hes telling me how bad Stephanie is and youre interrupting him with nonsense over nothing. Let me ask you this: Hes killing her. Hes going after her. She should be fired according to him. Trump then turned the tables on Tarshi. Michael, youre fired, he said. He definitely learned a lot about how to maneuver, to incite conflict between each contestant and each political candidate, said Tarshi, who has attended Trumps rallies and private parties promoting his presidential bid. YOU GOTTA BE QUICK - BOOM BOOM     The most popular season of The Apprentice was its first, in which Manigault was struck by the plaster. Even though that scene never aired, Manigault spent several episodes complaining about being hit on the head. It helped define her as the shows combative character - a role that made her famous and fueled the shows popularity.  She has remained a public figure and has endorsed Trump for president.In praising her combativeness at a rally last month, Trump could have been describing himself. When Omarosa goes after you, youve gotta be quick - boom boom - and youve gotta be fast, he told the crowd. ",politicsNews,"March 23, 2016 ",1
Republicans criticize partisan divide at FCC,"(Reuters) - Two Republicans on the Federal Communications Commission told a congressional panel Tuesday the partisan divide at the nations telecommunications regulatory body is growing.  FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai, a Republican, said at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing that the number of votes splitting along party lines at the five-member FCC is  growing under FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler - and is twice as high as under four prior chairmen. Proposals from Republican commissioners have been roundly rejected as crossing a red line, even when an identical proposal from a Democratic commissioner is accepted later on, Pai told a U.S. House panel. Collaboration has fallen by the wayside. Wheeler has a busy agenda in the final year of the Obama administration and has drawn the ire of some industry groups and Republicans in Congress. He has proposed allowing consumers access to pay TV without renting an expensive set-top cable box. He also has proposed privacy rules that would require Internet service providers to get consent for using consumer data and has unveiled a plan to expand a subsidy for low-income Americans that covers mobile phones to include broadband Internet access. Kim Hart, a spokeswoman for Wheeler, said the chairman has tackled complex issues resulting in more competition, strong protections and improved access to networks for consumers. During the first two years of the Chairmans tenure, 88 percent of votes have been unanimous. FCC Commissioner Michael ORielly, another Republican, criticized Wheeler for constantly pushing the envelope into questionable directions, at the expense of collegiality, staff morale and soundness of decisions. Republican commissioners have ramped up the rhetoric in recent months. After a federal appeals court put on hold two separate FCC decisions, Pai said the FCC needs to follow the law and return to the tradition of bipartisan, collaborative decision-making. Many Democrats back Wheelers aggressive agenda. Representative Anna Eshoo, of California, praised Wheeler for his aggressive agenda that puts the consumer first and strengthens competition. Representative Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican who chairs the panel that held the hearing, lamented the sharp divisions on the FCC, saying the commission should not give short shrift to collaboration in favor of expediency. At a Senate hearing this month, Wheeler declined to confirm he will step down at the end of the Obama administration, as is customary for the chair of the commission. The Senate has so far declined to reconfirm a Democratic commissioner, Jessica Rosenworcel, who was renominated in 2015.  ",politicsNews,"March 22, 2016 ",1
Measure to hike California's minimum wage to $15 qualifies for ballot,"(Reuters) - A proposal to raise Californias minimum wage to $15 an hour by the year 2021 has qualified to be listed on the upcoming November ballot in the state, officials said on Tuesday. The development comes as a wave of minimum wage increases at the state level sweeps the United States as the federal minimum wage has gone more than six years without an increase from $7.25 an hour. The California Secretary of States office said supporters of the measure, pushed by Labor group coalition Lift Up California, had gathered more than the 400,000 signatures needed to have the Fair Wage Act of 2016 placed on the ballot. California has led the country on environmental, health and civil rights protections and its only appropriate that we would become the first state to enact a minimum wage that allows millions of families to live in dignity, Los Angeles County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl said in a statement.  She added that the measure would build on the efforts of Los Angeles lawmakers, who last year passed a law hiking the citys minimum wage to $15 by 2020. The measure would boost the states minimum wage to $11 an hour in 2017, and increase it by a dollar an hour every year until reaching $15 an hour in 2021. After 2021, the minimum wage would be adjusted annually based on the rate of inflation. The California Chamber of Commerce said earlier this month that it would oppose any state-wide ballot initiatives for a $15 minimum wage, arguing that it would create new costs for state and local governments as well as businesses. A Field Poll published last August showed that about seven out of 10 respondents favored the measure, with nearly half saying they strongly favored it. Fourteen states and several cities began the new year with increases to their minimum wage. California and Massachusetts saw some of the biggest hikes among the states, both increasing from $9 to $10 an hour, according to an analysis by the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Obama high court nominee moves ahead with Senate meetings,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obamas Supreme Court selection Merrick Garland on Tuesday resumed meetings with senators in a push to convince Republicans who have vowed to block the nomination to reverse course and hold confirmation hearings this year. Its crystal clear after talking to him that Judge Garland has both a brilliant legal mind and a heart of gold, New York Senator Chuck Schumer, the Senates second-ranking Democrat, told reporters after huddling with the nominee. Those qualities, Schumer predicted, will convince Republicans to launch the confirmation process required to elevate Garland, an appellate judge and former prosecutor, to the Supreme Court. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, backed by most of his fellow Republicans, has insisted the Supreme Court vacancy resulting from conservative Justice Antonin Scalias Feb. 13 death be filled by whomever succeeds Obama next January after the Nov. 8 presidential election. Garland on Tuesday also met with Senator Robert Casey in the Pennsylvania Democrats office, and will continue a string of courtesy calls with Democrats. I hope that if we can stay at it, maybe we will get a breakthrough where folks (Republicans) will be willing not just to meet but to actually cast a vote on Garland, Casey told reporters after the meeting. Garland will hold private sessions with the relatively small number of the Senates 54 Republicans who have agreed to meet him. McConnell has pledged to prevent any Senate floor vote on confirming Garland and opposes Judiciary Committee hearings. Garland, while considered a centrist, could tilt the Supreme Court to the left for the first time in decades. Following Tuesdays bombings in Brussels that killed at least 30 people, Schumer noted Garland led the U.S. governments prosecution of the two men convicted in the 1995 Oklahoma City federal building bombing that killed 168 people. As someone who lives in New York who has experienced the horrors of terrorism close up and personal, the idea of having someone on the Supreme Court who understands those issues, as well as their horrible human effect, is very comforting, Schumer said. If the Senate does not act on Garland, the court vacancy could remain unfilled at least until the early months of next year, leaving it divided between four liberal justices and four conservatives. That creates the possibility of 4-4 split decisions, the first of which came on Tuesday and left in place a lower court ruling that two women could not sue a bank for loan discrimination.

Obama challenges Communist-led Cuba with call for democracy,"HAVANA (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama challenged Cubas Communist government with an impassioned call for democracy and economic reforms on Tuesday, addressing the Cuban people directly in a historic speech broadcast throughout the island. Taking the stage at Havanas Grand Theater with President Raul Castro in attendance, Obama said he was in Cuba to extend a hand of friendship and bury the last remnant of the Cold War in the Americas. But he also pressed hard for economic and political reforms and greater openness in a one-party state where the government stifles dissent, Internet access is low and the media is in state hands. His speech was the high point of a 48-hour trip made possible by his agreement with Castro in December 2014 to cast aside decades of hostility that began soon after Cubas 1959 revolution, and work to normalize relations.  Nonetheless, Obama threw down a very public gauntlet to Castro, saying Cubans cannot realize their full potential if his government does not allow change and relax its grip on Cuban politics and society.  I believe citizens should be free to speak their minds without fear, Obama told the audience on the final day of his visit. Voters should be able to choose their governments in free and democratic elections. Not everybody agrees with me on this, not everybody agrees with the American people on this but I believe those human rights are universal. I believe theyre the rights of the American people, the Cuban people and people around the world, Obama said. The hand-picked audience cheered him repeatedly, especially when he criticized the longstanding U.S. economic embargo against Cuba, spoke glowingly of Cubans talents and praised the countrys achievements in healthcare and education.  The spectacle of the leader of the United States, the superpower to the north for long reviled by Cubas government, standing in Havana and urging such changes in a speech broadcast into homes across the island would have been unthinkable before the two countries began their rapprochement 15 months ago. Since then, Obama has repeatedly used his executive powers to relax trade and travel restrictions, while also pushing Cuba to accelerate cautious market-style reforms introduced by Castro and allow greater political and economic freedom.  Castro has welcomed Obamas moves while insisting that a new relationship with the old enemy does not mean Cuba plans to change its political system. The audience of more than 1,000 people at Obamas speech on Tuesday included officials and business people from both countries, U.S. lawmakers and members of Cubas cultural elite. Obama drew sustained applause when he reiterated his call for the U.S. Congress to lift the embargo, which he called an outdated burden on the Cuban people.  But the response was more muted when he challenged Castro to allow greater political liberties.  Obama went straight from the speech to a private meeting with prominent dissidents on the island, a few of whom object to his engagement policy. As far as I am concerned nothing has changed, the repression continues, said Berta Soler from the Ladies in White group, who met Obama at the embassy. Cubas government dismisses the dissidents as mercenaries without public support but Obama applauded their work and extraordinary courage. Obama sees his dramatic shift away from a decades-old policy of trying to isolate and weaken Cuba as a success story and wants to make it an irreversible part of his legacy by the time he leaves office in January. Still, major obstacles remain to full normalization of ties, notably the differences over human rights, the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress refusal to lift the embargo and Washingtons resistance to discussing the return of the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Obamas critics at home have criticized his visit to Cuba as a premature reward to the Communist government. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, said on Tuesday the trip legitimizes what he called Castros tyrannical dictatorship. With his words carried live by Cubas state-run media, Obama sought to persuade ordinary Cubans that his new policy was focused primarily on helping them to improve their lives. Standing at a lectern flanked by U.S. and Cuban flags, he laid out a hopeful vision of future relations and told Cubans its up to you to take steps to change the country. Obama pointedly stopped short of what some of his critics had demanded  that he echo U.S. President Ronald Reagans famous exhortation in a 1987 speech in West Berlin for Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall. But he did encourage Cubans to embrace democracy, set up their own businesses and help improve Cuban society. Many suggested that I come here and ask the people of Cuba to tear something down. But Im appealing to the young people of Cuba who will lift something up, build something new, he said. Some Cubans who saw the speech in their homes or local cafes were also impressed by his frank admission of Americas own failings. He has been very honest in his statements, said Santiago Rodriguez, 78, in his home in central Havana. It is not only the blockade (embargo) that has overwhelmed us for years. This was a message full of suggestions and positive criticism for the future of Cuba. Castro, an army general who took over as president from his ailing brother, Fidel Castro, in 2008, was at the theater to greet Obama on arrival and sat in the audience for the speech. At the end, he lightly applauded from the balcony, then waved to the crowd. Later, the two leaders entered together to loud applause at Havanas Latin American Stadium and sat side-by-side for a baseball game between Cubas much-loved national team and Major League Baseballs Tampa Bay Rays. Castro was also on hand at the airport to bid Obama farewell, giving him an enthusiastic handshake at the bottom of Air Force Ones stairway and then exchanging waves once the U.S. leader reached the top. After the two men met on Monday, they aired some of the old grievances between their countries at a joint news conference, even as they sought to advance the diplomatic thaw. Obamas administration is seeking to galvanize the Cuban people to help him pressure their government for reforms. But flashes of anger from Castro at the news conference illustrated how Washington runs the risk of being accused of meddling. Obamas address on Tuesday was the first time a sitting U.S. presidents speech was broadcast to the Cuban people while on Cuban soil  although speeches by visiting popes have been carried live by state media. Jimmy Carter, traveling to Cuba in 2002 as the first former U.S. president to visit since the revolution, also called for political freedoms in a speech broadcast on live television.

New York lawmakers end last statewide ban on mixed martial arts,"ALBANY, N.Y. (Reuters) - New Yorks state assembly on Tuesday overwhelmingly voted to legalize mixed martial arts fights, effectively ending the last remaining statewide ban on the combat sport in the United States. Governor Andrew Cuomo has already said he would sign the measure, which previously passed the state Senate. Mixed martial arts features kicking, punching, wrestling and other maneuvers that can leave the combatants bloodied and sometimes unconscious. Lawmakers passed the legislation by a 113-25 vote after more than three hours of debate, with forceful speeches from both opponents and supporters of the bill. Assemblyman Danny ODonnell, an openly gay Democrat who represents part of New York City and is the brother of actress Rosie ODonnell, compared the sport to gay porn. He suggested the competitions might be susceptible to corruption. Ellen Jaffee, a Democrat from a New York City suburb, called the sport barbaric and said it is harmful to women because it distorts the image of masculinity. But Assembly Majority Leader Joseph Morelle, also a Democrat, said millions of fans deserve the chance to watch professional bouts in New York and argued that regulations would make the sport safer. The legislation came after years of obstruction from former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who opposed the sport and refused to allow a vote. But Silver was convicted of federal corruption charges last year and replaced as speaker by Carl Heastie, a co-sponsor of the bill. MMA fights are expected to generate $135 million a year for the states coffers, according to a 2013 study by the sports major promoter, Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). Arenas throughout New York would benefit, and Madison Square Garden in New York City is particularly well suited to stage the competitions, the bills sponsors said. Cuomo has already penciled in $3 million in revenue from ticket sales and cable fees in his proposed budget for the next fiscal year. The New York State Athletic Commission would have to set regulations after the governor signs the bill. Fans would have to wait until at least the fourth quarter of 2016 before seeing any bouts in the state. UFC is owned by brothers Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta of Station Casinos, a Las Vegas-based hotel-casino chain, through parent company Zuffa LLC [ZUFFA.UL]. The company had sued New York state over the ban, calling it unconstitutional. ",politicsNews,"March 22, 2016 ",1
Obama wins over Cubans with straight talk and humility ,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Lucila Morales stared in amazement at the flickering image of U.S. President Barack Obama on her old TV set on Tuesday, as he extolled democracy and political freedoms in a live speech capping his historic visit to the Communist-led island. Delivered from Havanas Grand Theater, the home of Cuban ballet, Obamas speech drew people to their televisions and radios across the city, impressing an audience not used to open political debate and surprised by his touches of humility.  Now hes thrown a grenade, Morales gasped when Obama spoke of the importance of the free and open exchange of ideas, long a taboo subject in a country where dissent is stifled, access to the Internet remains limited and the media is state-controlled. In his most pointed comments from the restored theater, where President Raul Castro was seated on a balcony with his top aides, Obama said Cubans should be able to choose their governments in free, democratic elections.  Im with you Obama, in choosing our next president, shouted computer student Roberto Iglesias, 28, popping his head round the door of Morales airy 1940s-era apartment near Havana University.  Obamas two-day trip to Cuba was the first by a sitting U.S. president since Calvin Coolidge sailed to Havana on a warship in 1928. Following a 2014 detente announced by Obama and Castro, the trip was a major step toward ending half a century of cold War animosity. Obama politely praised his hosts and accepted that before the revolution some Americans exploited Cuba. He acknowledged U.S. problems with racism but was frank about his belief in democracys superiority over Cubas one-party system. His acceptance of errors at home and in Cuba contrasted with past presidents who harangued their neighbor for decades after Fidel Castro overthrew a pro-American government in 1959. Obama vowed not to impose a different political or economic system on Cuba and instead urged Cubans to build on their own achievements, a resonant message for many young people proud of Cubas health, education and low crime, but hungry for change. He is calling on the young, on the Cuban people to build, not to destroy, said Amed Chincle, 31, watching the speech with his Afro-Cuban neighbors and family in a windowless apartment lit by a single strip bulb. Wearing a T-shirt with the logo of Hard Rock Cafe Boston, Chincle said he hoped Cuban authorities would heed Obamas advice by not assuming that every young person complaining about small injustices was trying to bring down the government. Lots of young people love their country and have no need to leave in search of a better system, but we should be able to speak and express ourselves without the government being uncomfortable, said Chincle, a self-employed cycle taxi rider angry at what he saw as abuse of power by the police.  They think that every protest by young people is a threat to the government - and thats not true, he said. More than anything though, it was the personal flourishes during Obamas three-day visit that won sympathy from Cubans. Obama spent hours on Monday listening to small business owners in a meeting at a state-run brewery, and his speech on Tuesday was littered with references to Cuban entrepreneurs such as a barber whose business was growing fast. Cutting hair was mostly a state activity until Raul Castro took power in 2008 and began cautious market-style reforms. A graphic designer who identified himself only by his first name Elicer said that changes allowing more free enterprise had been positive but the leadership was out of touch with the day to day lives of the people. With this meeting with entrepreneurs alone, Obama did what no president of this country has done in so many years - sit with ordinary people and ask what problems they have, he said.

Colombian FARC rebels at ballgame in Cuba attended by Obama,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Colombias leftist FARC rebel leader and U.S. President Barack Obama attended the same baseball game in Cuba on Tuesday, underscoring a message of regional cooperation that Obama took on his historic visit to the Communist-led country. FARC negotiator Pastor Alape confirmed the attendance of a contingent of 40 members and said the game between the Tampa Bay Rays and a Cuban team was a symbol of peace. A Reuters reporter also saw the rebels, who are in Havana for peace talks with the Colombian government. Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia leader Rodrigo Londono looked relaxed wearing a  baseball cap, blue Cuban team sweat jacket and sunglasses, and appeared to be enjoying the game with his fellow rebels. The representatives are believed to be nearing an agreement after three years of talks, although the two sides are unlikely to meet a self-imposed March 23 deadline to sign a peace deal. The U.S. State Department has designated FARC as a foreign terrorist organization and repeatedly accused it of drug trafficking.     In a speech on Tuesday directly addressing the Cuban people, Obama noted that the United States and Cuba had been on the different side of many conflicts in the Americas but today, Americans and Cubans are sitting together at the negotiating table and we are helping the Colombian people resolve the civil war that has dragged on for decades. U.S. Secretary of John Kerry met on Monday with the FARC negotiators and Colombian government officials at the talks. After the meeting, the FARC issued a statement thanking the United States for assisting at difficult moments in finding ways forward toward mutual understanding between the parties. The FARC said the U.S. role had led to a sector of Colombian society beginning to perceive the United States as a friend of a political solution to the conflict, versus a military one. The meeting highlighted the Obama administrations goal of using a new policy toward Cuba to improve its standing in the region and overcome long-running disputes. The Colombian conflict is the last and longest guerrilla conflict in Latin America, leaving a trail of over 220,000 dead since it began in the early 1960s. The United States has been an ally of the Colombian government over the years and has played an important role in militarily reducing the FARC presence in the country.

Trump's 'love' for Israel still not quite requited,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - I love the people in this room. I love Israel. I love Israel, Donald Trump told a convention of pro-Israel lobbyists in Washington this week. But the feeling still isnt quite mutual. At least not yet. In Israel, where distrust of Democratic President Barack Obama runs deep and conservative Benjamin Netanyahu is in his fourth term as prime minister, many voters might have been expected to prefer a Republican to take the White House. But the prospect that the candidate could be Trump  the real estate billionaire whose rhetoric toward ethnic minorities is widely viewed as inflammatory and whose proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States would affect nearly a fifth of Israelis  has alarmed politicians and voters alike. An opinion poll published last week on Israels Walla news site showed that 23 percent of Israelis want to see Trump in the Oval Office, compared to 38 percent who prefer the Democrats frontrunner, ex-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In December Trump called off a visit to Israel, saying he did not want to cause difficulty for Netanyahu, after Trumps proposal to ban Muslims from the United States drew an outcry. Netanyahu said at the time he was willing to meet any serious U.S. candidate, but strongly rejected Trumps views on Muslims, saying Israel respects all religions and diligently guards the rights of its citizens. Dozens of Israeli opposition lawmakers had signed a letter demanding Netanyahu call off the planned meeting. The letters author said Trumps racist remarks meant plans for the prime minister to meet him were disgracing Israels democratic character and hurting its Muslim citizens. One signatory, an Israeli Arab lawmaker, called Trump a neo-Nazi. Three months later, with Trump now on course for his partys nomination, his speech on Monday to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee seemed designed to shift perceptions of him squarely back towards the Republican mainstream. Trump delivered a speech that could easily have been written in the Prime Ministers Office in Jerusalem, wrote Chemi Shalev, correspondent for Israeli newspaper Haaretz. He went into the arena as a racist demagogue but soon came out as an ostensibly serious contender. Trump, who normally disdains prepared remarks, read his speech out from a teleprompter. His criticism of Obama won applause from the room, and he noted that his daughter Ivanka, who converted to Judaism and married a Jewish man, will soon give birth to a beautiful Jewish baby. Unlike Clinton, who spoke at the gathering in a morning session on Monday, Trump made no mention of a main sticking point in a now-dormant peace process  Jewish settlement on occupied land that Palestinians seek for a state. Instead, he pushed all the traditional applause buttons at a high-energy event replete with swelling music, accounts of Israeli high-tech achievements and shots of waving, and sometimes kissing, audience members displayed on a big screen. Among Trumps promises: dismantling a nuclear deal with Iran, vetoing any attempt by the United Nations to impose a peace settlement and moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which Israel considers its capital but almost all other countries, including the United States, do not. Still, Trump will have a way to go to win over many in a country suspicious of populist rhetoric. He is a chauvinist, a violent person who hates the blacks, the Arabs - anyone who is not his color, said Orly Marx, a 55-year-old housewife from Herzliya, near Tel Aviv. Part of Trumps difficulty in winning over Israelis is a message that has so far appeared inconsistent. Israelis are used to pouring carefully over U.S. signals toward their country for even the slightest deviation from established policies. Israel Radio noted on Tuesday that hours before giving his pro-Israel speech, Trump said at a news conference that U.S. allies would have to pay more for American military aid. Trump quickly backtracked, saying that Israel, which is locked in sensitive negotiations with the Obama administration over a new multi-billion-dollar 10-year military assistance package, can help us greatly. Clinton and Trumps Republican rivals criticized him for having said he would be neutral in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. American politicians from both parties portray Israel as a close ally, even if they believe it should do more to meet Palestinian demands in negotiations. Nevertheless, the right-leaning politics of many Israeli voters means Trump could become more popular if he emerges as the Republican nominee. Nina Gilbert, 47, an American-Israeli who works in Israels high-tech sector, said Israelis were simply looking forward to the day Obama leaves the White House. As far as they are concerned, anybody who is not Obama is better, she said. ",politicsNews,"March 22, 2016 ",1
Democratic Party workers pore over videos in bid to hobble Trump,"(Reuters) - From the basement to the third floor of Democratic Party headquarters in Washington, dozens of election campaign workers are glued to screens playing back videos of Donald Trump and other Republicans, digitally documenting their policy positions on everything from torture to climate change. The newly bulked up operation, including research, of more than 70 people is central to the Democrats strategy to sink whoever the Republicans nominate to run for the White House in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Party officials who provided Reuters with details of the operation increasingly think their target will be Trump, the New York businessman and former reality TV star who is the surprise Republican front-runner. The video clips will be used as grist for attack ads that will be deployed rapidly on social media sites any time Trump, or either of his rivals, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich, strays during the general election campaign from policy proposals they touted in the nominating contests across the country. That could, in theory, hinder them from appealing to the millions of more moderate votersneeded to beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the two competitors for the Democratic nomination. Democratic National Committee (DNC) spokesman Luis Miranda, who provided Reuters with a partial tour of the research operation, said voters in the run-up to Novembers election were not going to be as responsive to the divisive rhetoric that Trump used in the Republican campaign and that was a key part of our general election strategy. Trumps campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the Democratic Party operation. Trump leads Cruz with 678 delegates to the Texans 423 delegates and Kasich at 143 as of this week after a string of wins in states where his supporters favored his flamboyant rhetoric and plans to wall off the U.S. border with Mexico, deport millions of undocumented immigrants and temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country. Trump has also called for a revision of laws that ban torture, and wants to scrap trade deals he blames for job losses. There are two more Republican nominating contests on Tuesday. A candidate needs to accumulate at least 1,237 delegates to win the nomination at the Republican convention in July.   News and video monitoring have been election staples for years, but the latest operations bear little resemblance to the lower-tech past because of leaps in technology and the speed with which a candidates remarks are distributed. Everything is on steroids, said Jamal Simmons, a Democratic consultant, who recalled campaigns continuously taping news channels on VHS tapes - a tedious process that limited how much could be monitored. Other new technology, such as the live streaming application Periscope, makes news from around the world available almost instantly, said Holly Shulman, a Democratic strategist and former DNC official. Halfway around the world we were able to respond to something before the reporters looked at it even, she said. The Republican National Committee (RNC) said it has also ramped up its video monitoring efforts, with a focus on Clinton, adding staff and using newer technology. Eight people on the RNC staff are devoted to monitoring news coverage, and the party said it was building a searchable digital library of Clinton speeches, interviews and other events going back to 1991, the year before her husband Bill Clinton won the presidential election. Attacks on Trump by Republican rivals and Super PACs, independent political action committees that may raise unlimited sums of money,have failed to stop his campaigns momentum. But the DNC said it believes its strategy will be effective. For one, the Democrats believe the Republican establishments efforts to block Trumps nomination have been slow and disorganized - and hampered by a fear of tearing the party apart. The Democratic Party is also betting the general electorate will be more easily persuaded to counter Trump than registered Republicans have been. Clinton has a nearly 10-point lead over Trump in a hypothetical general election match up, according to an average of polls gathered by Real Clear Politics. The effort to hobble the former reality TV star takes a page out of reality television itself, where producers comb through thousands of hours of candid video, index it into an easily searchable library, and then paste together coherent narratives. The project helps address recommendations from the Democratic Victory Task Force, commissioned by DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, which in February 2015 suggested the party prepare for the 2016 election and promote the partys messaging. The DNC did similar work during the 2012 presidential election, but on a much smaller scale. Its digital and social media staff went from 5 to 25 people over the past 18 or so months, spokesman Miranda said. The current team divides its time on video from a wide range of sources - from national news to local channels, clips put up on YouTube by individual users and campaigns, and events webcast by the campaigns themselves.  It also has scouts that record in the field. The work has yielded a number of attack videos already, many prepared and sent out at a moments notice. On Feb. 28, for example, the party released a video slamming Republican presidential hopefuls for their opposition to action on climate change, featuring them denying man-made global warming alongside images of U.S. flooding, wildfires, droughts and heat waves. Earlier in March, after Trump cruised to victory in several state nominating contests, the DNC put out another 40-second video, mixing news clips talking about how Trump is dominating his party. These videos are getting tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of views across our various platforms, Miranda said. Hes not going to get off as easy with us as with the rest of the Republican field. We know what hes said, we know where hes flip-flopped, where hes made mistakes. ",politicsNews,"March 22, 2016 ",1
Trump backs waterboarding and 'a lot more' after Brussels attacks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States should use waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques when questioning terror suspects, and renewed his call for tougher U.S. border security after the attacks in Brussels. The billionaire businessman said authorities should be able to do whatever they have to do to gain information in an effort to thwart future attacks. Waterboarding would be fine. If they can expand the laws, I would do a lot more than waterboarding, Trump said on NBCs Today program, adding he believed torture could produce useful leads. You have to get the information from these people. Waterboarding, the practice of pouring water over someones face to simulate drowning as an interrogation tactic, was banned by President Barack Obama days after he took office in 2009. Critics call it torture.     Trumps main Republican rival, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, suggested heightened police scrutiny of neighborhoods with large Muslim populations. We need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized, he said in a statement. Trump also called for increased law enforcement surveillance of mosques in the United States.  You need surveillance. You have to deal with the mosques, whether we like it or not, Trump told Fox Business Network. These attacks ... theyre not done by Swedish people, that I can tell you. Islamic State claimed responsibility for Tuesdays suicide bomb attacks on Brussels airport and a rush-hour metro train in the Belgian capital which killed at least 30 people. Trump, who has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, urged tougher measures to stop the flow of illegal immigrants, particularly Syrian refugees, into America. As president ... I would be very, very tough on the borders, and I would be not allowing certain people to come into this country without absolute perfect documentation, said Trump, campaigning to become the Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election that will decide on Obamas successor.     The Brussels attacks brought national security back to the top of the presidential election agenda, possibly sharpening the division between Trumps isolationist approach to foreign policy and his Republican rivals more traditional interventionist outlook. On Monday, Trump expressed skepticism about the U.S. role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and said the United States should significantly cut spending on the defense alliance. Cruz criticized Trumps NATO proposal. The way to respond to terrorist attacks is not weakness. Its not unilateral and preemptive surrender. Abandoning Europe, withdrawing from NATO, as Trump suggests, is preemptive surrender, Cruz told reporters in Washington. Earlier attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California, have pushed security issues to the forefront of the White House campaign debate. When 130 people were killed in Paris in November, the threat of terrorism jumped from fifth to first on a Reuters/Ipsos poll list of the countrys most important problems and remained there until the economy moved back to the top of the list in mid-January. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said U.S. military leaders have found techniques like waterboarding are not effective. Weve got to work this through consistent with our values, she said on NBC, adding officials do not need to resort to torture, but they are going to need more help. Clintons Democratic rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, backed stronger intelligence-sharing and monitoring of social media in the fight against Islamist militants, but opposed bolstered surveillance of Muslim communities. That would be unconstitutional, and it would be wrong. We are fighting a terrorist organization, a barbaric organization that is killing innocent people. We are not fighting a religion, Sanders told reporters. Walid Phares, named by Trump this week as one of his foreign policy experts, told Reuters the Brussels attacks would force Europe and the United States to reassess counter-terrorism strategies in identifying the radicalized elements and also the type of protection soft targets need. Trump looks to take another step toward winning the Republican presidential nomination in contests in Arizona and Utah on Tuesday, aiming to deal another setback to the party establishments flagging stop-Trump movement. He has a big lead in convention delegates who will pick the Republican nominee, defying weeks of attacks from members of the party establishment worried he will lead the Republicans to defeat in November.  In Arizona, one of the U.S. states that borders Mexico, Trumps hardline immigration message is popular and he leads in polls, while in Utah Trump lags in polls behind Cruz.  In addition to the temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, Trump has called for the building of a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border to halt illegal immigration.

U.S. states giving more ex-felons voting rights back,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Baltimore community organizer Perry Hopkins, 55, is looking forward to stepping into a voting booth for the first time in his life this election season. Hopkins lost his never-exercised right to vote when he was convicted for drug and other offenses. He gained it back last month when Maryland joined a growing list of U.S. states making it easier for ex-convicts to vote. To have the right to vote now is empowering. Im stoked, said Hopkins, who spent a total of 19 years in prison for non-violent crimes, and was one of 40,000 in the state to regain his right to vote from a legislative action.  I plan to vote in every election possible. Im voting for mayor, Im voting for city councilman in my district, and, yes, Im voting for president, said Hopkins. He hopes to vote for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the front-runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, on Nov. 8. Hopkins is among some 800,000 Americans who have regained the right to vote in the last two decades as about two dozen states have eased restrictions on felons casting ballots, according to the Sentencing Project, a prison reform advocacy group. The restoration of voting rights has drawn support from both Democrats and Republicans as a way to improve prisoners reintegration into society. The trend is to reconsidering policies and scaling back (restrictions). There are setbacks on the way, but the trend is in that direction, said Mark Mauer, the Sentencing Projects executive director. Advocates contend it is also a way of promoting racial justice, as African-Americans are convicted of crimes and sent to prison at about twice the rate of the overall U.S. population. Of the 5.8 million Americans banned from voting, 2.2 million are African-American, according to the group. In three states - Virginia, Florida and Kentucky - more than a fifth of black residents outside of prison are barred from casting a ballot. About 13 percent of the U.S. population is African-American. Wyomings Republican-controlled legislature last year restored voting rights to felons convicted of non-violent crimes. A lawsuit before the Iowa Supreme Court aims to strike down the states voting restriction. Iowa, along with Kentucky and Florida, have the countrys harshest rules, prohibiting all ex-felons from voting unless they secure an exemption from the governor. In Kentucky, outgoing Democratic Governor Steve Beshear signed an executive order in November granting the vote to non-violent offenders who had finished their sentences, including parole. His successor, Republican Matt Bevin, rolled back the order, saying Beshear had acted without approval of the legislature. At least 60,000 California inmates had voting rights extended to them in August when state officials dropped their challenge to a court ruling that allowed newly released felons to cast ballots. Were seeing more of these proposals. I do think that change takes time, its an issue that weve seen people come around to, said Tomas Lopez, a counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York, who tracks felon disenfranchisement. While the initiatives have seen bipartisan support in some states, that breaks down on the presidential campaign trail. Among Democrats, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has a plank in his platform calling for the restoration of voting rights to ex-inmates. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has called on the campaign trail for felons to get rights back. None of the three Republican candidates - real estate magnate Donald Trump, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich - mention felons voting rights in their platforms. The United States has a patchwork of state laws governing felons voting rights, many dating from the 19th century. They range from two states - Maine and Vermont - that allow prison  inmates to vote, to the lifetime bans. Re-enfranchising felons has drawn uncommon political bedfellows, with the liberal American Civil Liberties Union aligned with Mark Holden, the general counsel for Koch Industries, the conglomerate controlled by conservative political donors Charles and David Koch. Efforts are also under way in Congress, often the scene of bitter partisan divide, to address the issue. Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, has sponsored a bill that would restore voting rights in federal elections to ex-felons without violent offenses. Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate minority leader, is co-sponsor. The American Correctional Association, the Police Executive Research Forum and the American Probation and Parole Association also have backed the trend as potentially helping to reduce crime. A 2011 study by the Florida parole board showed that ex-offenders who were able to vote were one-third as likely to end up back in prison.  To continue to place a scarlet letter on an individual as if they had a life sentence is just wrong, said Veronica Cunningham, the parole associations executive director.

New York lawmakers expected to clear way for mixed martial arts fights,"ALBANY, N.Y. (Reuters) - New York is poised to join the rest of the country in legalizing mixed martial arts (MMA) fights, as the state Assembly prepares to pass a bill to end a ban on the full-contact sport, a measure the Senate has approved on multiple occasions over the years. The lower house of the New York State Assembly is expected to vote on Tuesday afternoon on the legislation, long stymied by the refusal of Assembly leaders to allow the measure to come to the floor despite broad support from lawmakers. Its passage will clear the way for Governor Andrew Cuomo to enact the bill into law. Cuomo, a Democrat who needs revenue generated by the sport for his proposed budget, has already said he would sign the measure. New York is the only state prohibiting MMA, a controversial sport that features kicking, punching, wrestling and other maneuvers that can leave the combatants with bloodied and sometimes unconscious.  The move to bring the bill up for a vote in the Assembly comes a year after Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver resigned in a corruption scandal. He was replaced by a former co-sponsor of the bill, Assemblyman Carl E. Heastie, a Bronx Democrat. Michael Whyland, a spokesman for Heastie, said in an email that the floor vote is expected to take place on Tuesday. MMA fights are expected to generate $135 million a year for the states coffers, according to a 2013 study by the sports promoters, Ultimate Fighting Championship.  Arenas throughout New York would benefit and Madison Square Garden in New York City is particularly well-suited to stage the competitions, the bills sponsors say. Cuomo has already penciled in $3 million in revenue from ticket sales and cable fees in his proposed budget for the next fiscal year. The New York State Athletic Commission would have to set regulations after the governor signs the bill. Fans would have to wait until at least the fourth quarter of 2016 before seeing any bouts in the state, according to supporters. The legislation would effectively spell an end to pending lawsuits against the state for banning mixed martial arts, its backers say.

U.S. says it may not need Apple to open San Bernardino iPhone,"(Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors said Monday that a third party had presented a possible method for opening an encrypted iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters, a development that could bring an abrupt end to the high-stakes legal showdown between the government and Apple Inc (AAPL.O). A federal judge in Riverside, California, late Monday agreed to the governments request to postpone a hearing scheduled for Tuesday so that the FBI could try the newly discovered technique. The Justice Department said it would update the court on April 5. The government had insisted until Monday that it had no way to access the phone used by Rizwan Farook, one of the two killers in the December massacre in San Bernardino, California, except to force Apple to write new software that would disable the password protection.  The Justice Department last month obtained a court order directing Apple to create that software, but Apple has fought back, arguing that the order is an overreach by the government and would undermine computer security for everyone. The announcement on Monday that an unnamed third party had presented a way of breaking into the phone on Sunday - just two days before the hearing and after weeks of heated back-and-forth in court filings - drew skepticism from many in the tech community who have insisted that there were other ways to get into the phone. From a purely technical perspective, one of the most fragile parts of the governments case is the claim that Apples help is required to unlock the phone, said Matt Blaze, a professor and computer security expert at the University of Pennsylvania. Many in the technical community have been skeptical that this is true, especially given the governments considerable resources. Former prosecutors and lawyers supporting Apple said the move suggested that the Justice Department feared it would lose the legal battle, or at minimum would be forced to admit that it had not tried every other way to get into the phone. In a statement, the Justice Department said its only interest has always been gaining access to the information on the phone and that it had continued to explore alternatives even as litigation began. It offered no details on the new technique except that it came from a non-governmental third party, but said it was cautiously optimistic it would work. That is why we asked the court to give us some time to explore this option, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, Melanie R. Newman, said. If this solution works, it will allow us to search the phone and continue our investigation into the terrorist attack that killed 14 people and wounded 22 people. It would also likely end the case without a legal showdown that many had expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court. An Apple executive told reporters on a press call that the company knew nothing about the Justice Departments possible method for getting into the phone, and that the government never gave any indication that it was continuing to search for such solutions.  The executive characterized the Justice Departments admission Monday that it never stopped pursuing ways to open the phone as a sharp contrast with its insistence in court filings that only Apple possessed the means to do so. Nate Cardozo, staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties group backing Apple, said the San Bernardino case was the hand-chosen test case for the government to establish its authority to access electronic information by whatever means necessary. In that context, he said, the last-minute discovery of a possible solution and the cancellation of the hearing is suspicious, and suggests the government might be worried about losing and setting a bad precedent.  But George Washington University law professor Orin Kerr, a former Justice Department computer crime prosecutor, said the government was likely only postponing the fight. The problem is not going away, its just been delayed for a year or two, he said. Apple said that if the government was successful in getting into the phone, which might involve taking advantage of previously undiscovered vulnerabilities, it hoped officials would share information on how they did so. But if the government drops the case it would be under no obligation to provide information to Apple.    In opposing the court order, Apples chief executive, Tim Cook, and his allies have argued that it would be unprecedented to force a company to develop a new product to assist a government investigation, and that other law enforcement agencies around the world would rapidly demand similar services. Law enforcement officials, led by Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, have countered that access to phones and other devices is crucial for intelligence work and criminal investigations.  The government and the tech industry have clashed for years over similar issues, and Congress has been unable to pass legislation to address the impasse.      ",politicsNews,"March 21, 2016 ",1
Obama spars with Cuba's Castro over human rights in historic visit,"HAVANA (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama pushed Cuba to improve human rights during his historic visit to the Communist-led island on Monday, publicly sparring with President Raul Castro who showed flashes of anger and hit back at U.S. double standards.  Obama praised Castro for openly discussing their differences but he said a full flowering of the relationship would happen only with progress on the issue of rights. In the absence of that, I think it will continue to be a very powerful irritant, Obama said in a joint news conference with Castro that began with jokes but was tense at times.      America believes in democracy. We believe that freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and freedom of religion are not just American values but are universal values, he said. Both mens remarks were broadcast live on Cuban state television from Cubas Palace of the Revolution in a room draped with the Stars and Stripes and the Cuban flag.   Castro countered that no country meets all international rights but appeared uncomfortable as he made the rare step of taking questions from journalists in a country where the media is state controlled. Obama, the first U.S. president to visit Cuba in 88 years, agreed in 2014 to improve relations with the former Cold War foe but he is under pressure at home to push Castros government to allow political dissent and to further open its Soviet-style economy. He said the two sides would hold talks on human rights in Havana later this year.  Opponents say Obama has given away too much as he improves ties, with too little from Castro in return, although the leading Republican candidate for the Nov. 8 presidential election, Donald Trump, said on Monday he would likely continue to normalize ties with Cuba if elected.  Castro, an army general who became president when his ailing older brother Fidel retired in 2008, had never before taken questions from foreign reporters on live Cuban television and was clearly irritated when asked about political prisoners in Cuba, demanding the reporter produce a list of those in jail. Tell me now. What political prisoners? Give me a name, or the names, Castro said. And if there are these political prisoners they will be free before nightfall.    Cuba says it has no political prisoners and that the dozens listed by dissident groups are instead common criminals.  Castro said Cuba has a strong record on rights such as health, access to education and womens equality. His government criticizes the United States on racism, police violence and the use of torture at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba. Ben Rhodes, a senior Obama aide, later insisted that Cuba has political prisoners and said the U.S. government had shared lists of them with Cuba. He said Cuba has shifted from long prisons terms to short-term detentions of political opponents. Later in the evening, Castro sat between Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for a dinner of rum flavored soup and pork, at a table that also included the leaders top advisers. Obamas ease with reporters questions contrasted with Castros manner. The tension was palpable as Castro declined to call on a slew of Cuban journalists who yearned for the rare chance to ask him questions. Fumbling with a headset providing translation, the 84-year-old leader scolded reporters when he was asked again about rights, saying he agreed to only take one question. Obama playfully encouraged him to address a second but Castro seemed reluctant as he obliged. How many countries comply with all 61 human rights? Do you know? I do. None. None, Castro said.     In another awkward moment, as the news conference ended, Castro lifted Obamas arm in the air as if to form a victory salute. Obama resisted, letting his hand hang limp rather than form a fist.     As part of the diplomatic breakthrough in 2014, Cuba released 53 prisoners that the U.S. government considered political prisoners. But the dissident Cuban Commission of Human Rights and National Reconciliation says 79 are still behind bars, among about 40 held for peaceful political protest. This list is here if they want to see it, commission leader Elizardo Sanchez said on Monday. His list also includes armed anti-government militants, convicted hijackers, army deserters and spies, but Sanchez said they are political because they were denied due process. Castro offered Cubas recipe for better relations, saying the United States needs to lift its 54-year-old trade embargo on the island and hand back the Guantanamo Bay base to Cuba. Obama did not respond to the demand on Guantanamo Bay but said he was optimistic about the elimination of sanctions against Cuba. The embargos going to end. When, I cant be entirely sure, Obama said.  Obama efforts to encourage Congress to rescind the embargo has been rejected by the Republican leadership. Thwarted, Obama has instead used executive authority to loosen restrictions on trade and travel. Obama said direct flights from the United States would start this year. He said regular tourism to Cuba could happen very soon, in comments to U.S. network ABC. A clutch of deals timed to coincide with the visit appeared to show the strategy was bearing commercial fruit, notably U.S. cruise company Carnivals announcement on Monday that it would sail the first ship from the United States to Cuba in more than 50 years, in a deal that will bring in thousands of U.S. tourists at a time. About a dozen major U.S. brands have stuck deals or are in talks with Cuba. Ahead of the meeting with Castro, Obama said Google would provide more Wi-Fi and broadband access on the island. Google said later its efforts were in the early stages. ",politicsNews,"March 21, 2016 ",1
Puerto Rico takes restructuring law to U.S. high court ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Puerto Rico will ask the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday to validate a law that could let it cut billions of dollars from what it owes in debt at some public agencies, a key test in the islands efforts to weather a massive fiscal crisis. The U.S. territory, facing what its governor has called an unpayable $70 billion debt and a 45 percent poverty rate, will argue its case against financial creditors, including Franklin Advisers and OppenheimerFunds, who want to keep contentious restructuring talks out of court. As Puerto Rico leaders, creditors and U.S. lawmakers seek a debt solution in the U.S. Congress, the question before the Supreme Court is whether the island should be allowed to restructure debts under a court-supervised regime similar to Chapter 9 bankruptcy laws used by U.S. cities such as Detroit and Stockton, California. It is very significant that the Supreme Court took this case  were seeing efforts to try to determine with some more clarity the status of Puerto Rico, said bankruptcy expert Melissa Jacoby, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law. Puerto Rico, which as a U.S. commonwealth is excluded from Chapter 9, passed the Recovery Act in 2014, a local restructuring law that lets it put public entities, such as power authority PREPA, into bankruptcy. Two U.S. court decisions deemed the Recovery Act invalid after PREPA creditors sued, with the Supreme Court agreeing in December to hear an appeal. Creditors say the act contradicts federal bankruptcy law, which prohibits states from making their own debt restructuring laws. Puerto Rico argues that if it is exempt from Chapter 9, it must also be exempt from the limitation on states passing their own laws. It makes no sense to read a limitation on Chapter 9 to apply to a jurisdiction  that is categorically excluded from that chapter, it said in January. The outcome could threaten a hard-fought, consensual restructuring at PREPA, where creditors holding most of the utilitys $8.3 billion in debt agreed to take 15 percent reductions in payouts. Reinstating the Recovery Act could allow Puerto Rico to scrap that deal and instead put PREPA into bankruptcy, where it could impose deeper cuts and bind holdout creditors to the deal. Jacoby said the decision might come down to the court focusing on how Congress previously interpreted bankruptcy law. Its all about legislative history, said Jacoby.

Republican lawmakers to join Obama's Cuba visit,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A small group of Republican lawmakers will join President Barack Obamas historic trip to Cuba on Sunday, underlining growing divisions in the party over the future of the United States trade embargo against the island nation. At least five Republicans, all known for favoring normal trade relations with Cuba, will make the trip, congressional sources and lawmakers told Reuters.  Republican congressional leaders have made opposition to President Barack Obamas easing of the Cuban trade embargo a hallmark of their foreign policy. But an increasing number of party members, drawn by the economic benefits of scrapping the cold war-era embargo, are lining up to back the White House. This is the right policy. Hes done the right thing, said Republican Senator Jeff Flake, an outspoken proponent of closer ties with Cuba who is going to Havana. Besides Flake, Republicans making the trip include House of Representatives members Mark Sanford, Tom Emmer and Reid Ribble, as well as Senator Dean Heller, congressional sources and lawmakers said. All of the representatives confirmed their participation, except for Heller, whose office declined requests for comment. But other lawmakers confirmed his travel. Republicans backing Obamas policy cut against the grain of the partys establishment thinking that seeks to avoid giving Obama any kind of policy win, either domestically or internationally. Normalizing relations with Cuba would be a significant foreign policy legacy for Obama. Many Republicans see the embargo as contrary to their partys pro-business tenets and believe the government should not tell citizens where they can travel. Its about Americans freedom and embracing engagement rather than isolation as a way of changing other governments, Sanford said in a Facebook post explaining his decision to make the trip. At least 15 of the 54 Republicans in the Senate, mostly members from states like Kansas where agriculture is a significant industry, have publicly backed increased Cuban trade or fewer restrictions on travel. Supporters of Obamas policy say the total number of Republican supporters in the House and Senate reaches several dozen. Some members say they want to see how the election plays out before speaking publicly. The U.S. embargo on Cuba, first imposed in 1960, can be lifted only via a majority vote in Congress, which is now controlled by Republicans. Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro shocked the world in December 2014 by abruptly announcing the Cold War adversaries would move to normalize relations after more than a half-centurys estrangement. The news drew immediate condemnation in Congress, where a bloc of mostly Republican Cuban-American lawmakers has worked to keep tight restrictions on trade and travel with Cuba for years. Although polls show 72 percent of Americans want to abandon the embargo, the Republican party line has firmly supported the restrictions. Critics of Obamas policy say Cubas government is still too repressive for the United States to ease restrictions.  But this week businessman Donald Trump, who has questioned the embargo, easily won the Republican primary in Florida, defeating leading embargo advocate Senator Marco Rubio. Trumps victory countered the long-standing assumption that the states Cuban exiles would defeat any anti-embargo candidate. A young generation of Cuban-Americans has warmed to Obamas engagement policy, with many excited about the chance to open businesses in their homeland. Ribble, a founder of the House Cuba Working Group who is going on the trip, represents Wisconsin, one of several states where farmers want the chance to sell to an island just 90 miles from the U.S. coast. American producers are missing out on a market that imports the vast majority of its agricultural products, and Cubans are missing out on exposure to the freedom and democracy that lies just 90 miles from their shore, Ribble said in a statement.

Trump vows strong ties with Israel if elected president,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump vowed on Monday to pursue a strong U.S. alliance with Israel if elected president in November and said he would resist any attempt by the United Nations to impose its will on the Jewish state. In a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Trump said he would side with Israel, a close U.S. ally, in any negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians. The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is unbreakable, he said. They must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel and they must come to the table willing to accept that Israel is a Jewish state and it will forever exist as a Jewish State, Trump told the pro-Israel lobbying group. Trump also questioned the role of the United Nations in the peace process, saying any attempt by the international body to impose a Middle East agreement would be a disaster.

Kerry encouraged by Colombia peace talks after Havana meeting,"HAVANA (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was encouraged by progress in the Colombian peace process after meeting on Monday in Havana with representatives of Colombias Marxist FARC guerrilla group and the Bogota government, a State Department spokesman said. Kerry, in Cuba as part of U.S. President Barack Obamas historic visit to the Communist-run island, met the two sides separately and called for them to redouble their efforts to resolve the remaining issues in the talks, spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement. Kerry told both sides he was encouraged that the end of conflict issues are now front and center in the negotiations, including a formal bilateral ceasefire monitored by the U.N. Security Council, a timetable for disarmament, and security guarantees post-conflict for all lawful political actors, according to the statement. His involvement at the request of Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos marked the first time a U.S. secretary of state had met with negotiators from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia since peace talks started in Havana more than three years ago.  The meeting between the Colombian government delegation and Kerry was very productive, lead government negotiator Humberto de la Calle told journalists. There were extraordinarily concrete elements, de la Calle said. For example, the announcement of help from the United States relating to the security of people who lay down arms, which is a critical subject at the talks.  The FARC thanked the U.S. for its support of the peace talks and said they hope to reach a final peace agreement in the coming months. On a not-distant date we will give good news to the country and the world - that Colombia has reached peace, the rebel group said in a statement on its website. Last year, the two sides agreed a March 23 deadline for a final accord, but negotiators have said a deal by that date now looks unlikely. Washington designated the FARC a foreign terrorist organization in 1997, and many of its leaders have been indicted in the United States on charges of cocaine trafficking. The United States sees the Colombian peace talks hosted by Cuba as an example of how restoring normal relations with Havana can help it achieve its wider goals in Latin America. The Colombian war is the regions longest-running conflict, with some 220,000 people killed and millions of others displaced since 1964. ",politicsNews,"March 21, 2016 ",1
"Trump vows strong U.S. ties with Israel, draws fire from Clinton","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump on Monday vowed an unbreakable U.S. alliance with Israel if he is elected president in November, seeking to clear up confusion over his repeated pledges to remain neutral in any peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. Trumps speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a powerful pro-Israel lobbying group, was part of a daylong effort by the anti-Washington candidate to persuade establishment Republicans to get behind his insurgent candidacy and give up on an effort to deny him the partys presidential nomination. Describing Israel as ready to negotiate a peace agreement, Trump said the Palestinians would have to be willing to accept that Israel will forever exist as a Jewish state and able to stop attacks on Israelis. The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is unbreakable, the New York billionaire businessman said. Trump has drawn fire for his position on Middle East peace negotiations. He has described himself as extremely pro-Israel, but has said he would take a neutral stance in trying to negotiate an elusive peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. Trumps critics have said he could harm long-standing U.S. support for Israel. Trumps leading Republican rival, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, reminded the AIPAC gathering of Trumps position. Let me be very, very clear, Cruz said. As president I will not be neutral. America will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, used her AIPAC appearance to attack Trump. We need steady hands, not a president who says hes neutral on Monday, pro-Israel on Tuesday and who-knows-what on Wednesday because everythings negotiable, she said. Clinton also took aim at Trumps vow that, if elected, he would deport illegal immigrants and bar Muslims temporarily from entering the United States.  If you see bigotry, oppose it, if you see violence, condemn it, if you see a bully, stand up to him, she said. In a rarity, Trump delivered his AIPAC speech with the aid of a TelePrompter, abandoning his typical free-wheeling style. Throughout the day, his public remarks lacked their usual bombast, an obvious effort to appear more presidential.  At a news conference, Trump presented himself as Republicans best chances of capturing the White House in the Nov. 8 election. He took steps to appear as the nominee-in-waiting, releasing the names of some foreign policy advisers and pledging to name seven to 10 people he would pick for the Supreme Court. Trump said establishment Republicans would be making a mistake if they persuade a high-profile party leader to launch a third-party run to deny him the White House. He said it would almost certainly mean the Democrats would win the presidency. If people want to be smart, they should embrace this movement, Trump said at the site of a new hotel he is building in Washington. If they dont want to be smart, they should do what theyre doing now and the Republicans are going to go down to a massive loss. Trump laid out some foreign policy priorities in a CNN interview, saying the United States is contributing more than it should to the NATO alliance and that he would continue a U.S. thaw toward Cuba begun by President Barack Obama, who is now in Havana. Trump was in Washington for closed-door talks with a variety of Republicans organized by his top backer in the capital, U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. It was his most overt bid yet to seek party unity at a time when many establishment Republicans bitterly oppose him. The meeting, held at the offices of the Jones Day law firm, included some Republican lawmakers and a former Republican speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, and former Congressman Bob Livingston. Weve had almost eight years of Mr. Obama, whos been a disastrous president. We have now an opportunity to change course or have four more years of the same. And I think that Donald Trump is the alternative, Livingston said after the session. Also at the meeting were Representatives Renee Ellmers of North Carolina and Chris Collins of New York, as well as former Senator Jim DeMint, who is head of the Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative Washington think-tank. In a separate session with the Washington Post editorial board, Trump named some members of his foreign policy team. The team included Walid Phares, who Trump called a counter-terrorism expert; George Papadopoulos, an oil and energy consultant; and Joe Schmitz, a former inspector general at the Department of Defense. Trumps rise has alarmed establishment Republicans who have tried in vain to stop him. Their best hope of derailing his insurgent candidacy is to stretch the contest out and deny him the 1,237 delegates needed to formally win the partys presidential nomination. Trump has 678 delegates to 423 for Cruz and 143 for Ohio Governor John Kasich, according to the Associated Press.  If Trump does not win the 1,237 delegates, the Republican nominee would be decided at the partys convention in Cleveland in July.  ",politicsNews,"March 21, 2016 ",1
Gundlach sees Donald Trump nomination causing 'global growth scare',"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jeffrey Gundlach, the widely followed investor who runs DoubleLine Capital, foresees a global growth scare between now and the end of the summer, triggered by a presidential nomination of Donald Trump. That is where I see the vulnerabilities, Gundlach said in a telephone interview on Monday. Trumps protectionist policies could mean negative global growth, Gundlach warned. As he gets the nomination, the markets and investors are going to worry about it more. You will see a downgrading of global growth based on geopolitical risks. You must factor this into your risk-management.  Trump has blamed currency devaluations around the world for hurting the U.S. economy and costing American jobs, and has called for a tougher U.S. stance on trade. We just sit back and do nothing, Trump said earlier this month. Thats getting to be very dangerous as far as Im concerned. A more effective economic move than devaluations would be charging a tax on products made abroad and sold in the United States, particularly those from China, Trump said. Gundlach, who oversees $93 billion at Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital, said it isnt premature to think about a Trump nomination. You have to entertain the hypothetical. Phone calls and emails to Trumps spokeswoman were not returned.   For its part, stock markets, which moved into positive territory after the U.S. Federal Reserves dovish move last week, will continue to track oil prices, Gundlach said, who was prescient in his call for $40 per barrel. I think oil will have a hard time moving up to $45, Gundlach said. The risk-reward proposition is so bad right now because you had this easy rally in risk markets, Gundlach said. He added: No way I would buy junk bonds at this level.  Gundlach also criticized Fed officials for changing their stance on interest rates. Theyve been flip-flopping like crazy over the past few months, he said.      Just three days after the Fed held interest rates and cautioned global economic and financial developments continue to pose risks, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said on Monday that the United States may be in line for an interest rate hike as soon as April given sufficient momentum in U.S. growth.  Gundlach said its become obvious Fed officials are seeking guidance from markets. If it is going to be about the markets, they should just come out and say, If the S&P hits 2,100 we will tighten - and if it goes to 1,900 we will ease, Gundlach said.

Senate proposal on encryption gives judges broad powers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators has begun circulating long-awaited draft legislation that would give federal judges clear authority to order technology companies like Apple to help law enforcement officials access encrypted data, according to sources familiar with the discussions. The proposal from Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, does not spell out how companies must provide access or the circumstances under which they could be ordered to help. It also does not create specific penalties for noncompliance, leaving that determination to judges, the sources said. Previous legislative efforts have focused on requiring technology products to have a built-in back door for law enforcement. The latest approach would not mandate any specific technology, but rather would require companies to figure out how to access the data. Congress has tried and failed for years to pass legislation that could prevent criminals and spies from going dark, or hiding from law enforcement by using encrypted computer and communications services. The latest effort died when the Obama administration signaled last fall that it would not support it. But Apples high-profile showdown with the government over a federal magistrate judges order that it unlock an iPhone connected to the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, has reopened the debate. Apple and the Justice Department are set to face off in court on Tuesday. The going-dark issue has been gathering momentum (in Congress) like a train coming down the tracks, but it still seemed for a while like it was going to be a long time before it got to the station, Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told Reuters in an interview. But it arrived with a fury with this lawsuit. Apple and many of its allies argue that the court is over-reaching its authority in the San Bernardino case and that Congress should ultimately resolve the encryption debate. President Obama warned a tech conference earlier this month against fetishizing phones and made it clear that he supports law enforcement efforts to gain access to encrypted information. Administration officials have reviewed the legislation from Burr and Feinstein and offered suggested edits, the sources said, signaling that the White House may now be more open to a legislative approach. Still, the Burr-Feinstein effort is expected to face a steep climb in a gridlocked Congress wary about tackling such a complex and controversial issue during an election year. We have previously been quite skeptical of legislative handling of this particular matter, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters last month after the Apple case began. I dont know at this point whether or not (conversations with lawmakers) will result in a piece of legislation that we will embrace. In an attempt to break the congressional stalemate on encryption, Democratic Senator Mark Warner and Republican Representative Michael McCaul, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, introduced legislation earlier this month to form a national encryption commission to further study the issue.  That effort has been criticized by some privacy advocates who believe its composition would be skewed to favor law enforcement. Others have complained that it would give Congress an excuse to continue postponing action on encryption.",politicsNews,"March 21, 2016 ",1
Trump questions U.S. financial backing for NATO,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States should significantly cut spending on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said on Monday, questioning a policy that has underpinned U.S. foreign relations for nearly 70 years.  Trump, whose worldviews have been rebuked by a section of the Republican establishment, made the comments as he unveiled a partial list of foreign policy advisers, who are relatively little known. We are paying disproportionately (for NATO). Its too much and frankly its a different world than it was when we originally conceived of the idea, Trump said in an interview on CNN. We have to reconsider. Keep NATO, but maybe we have to pay a lot less toward NATO itself. NATO, now consisting of 28 members, was formed after World War Two as a Western military alliance against the Soviet bloc. The comments reinforced Trumps relatively isolationist stance on foreign policy. The New York billionaire businessman has alarmed establishment Republican foreign policy thinkers with comments denigrating Muslims and Mexican immigrants, and with his vows to tear up international trade deals.  Announcing his foreign policy advisers in an interview with the Washington Post editorial board, he said the United States should not be nation-building anymore, adding that Washington could not afford to keep funding NATO at current levels. We certainly cant afford to do this anymore, he said. Trump has said he is willing to work more closely with authoritarian Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose military intervention in Ukraine has increased tensions with NATO. Washington is the biggest contributor to NATO, and U.S. officials have long been critical of its European allies for not spending more.   NATO is planning its biggest buildup in Eastern Europe since the Cold War to deter Russia, helped by an increase in planned U.S. spending. The happiest person hearing this would be Vladimir Putin, said retired Admiral James Stavridis, NATOs former Supreme Allied Commander Europe. We are all frustrated with low European defense spending, but pulling away from NATO would be an extraordinary geopolitical mistake.     Trumps advisory team includes terrorism expert Walid Phares, energy industry executive Carter Page, international energy lawyer George Papadopoulos, former Pentagon Inspector General Joe Schmitz and former Army Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg. He said he would soon name more people helping him shape his foreign policies as part of the team, led by U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions, a Republican from Alabama who endorsed Trump last month.  Taken as a group, its a fairly obscure set of individuals, said Michael OHanlon, a national security and defense policy specialist at the Brookings Institution, adding he did not recognize most of the names on Trumps list.  Trump, one of three remaining Republican presidential candidates for the Nov. 8 election, has been under increasing pressure in recent weeks to say who advises him on foreign and security matters. One hundred and twenty Republican national security experts who served in past presidential administrations have signed a letter saying they cannot support Trump and will work to ensure he is not elected. Phares told Reuters he began advising Trump on Friday. He previously served as a national security adviser to 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who has roundly criticized Trump. Phares said in an email he had not met Trump in person since last year. The others on the list could not be immediately reached to confirm their roles with Trumps campaign.     Schmitz was Pentagon inspector general under President George W. Bush and worked for Blackwater Worldwide, a now-defunct private U.S. security firm whose personnel were involved in a deadly shooting that killed Iraqi civilians in 2007. Kellogg has considerable military experience, having served as chief operating officer of the Coalition Provisional Authority, the U.S.-run provisional government imposed on Iraq after the U.S.-led 2003 invasion under Bush. He has worked at CACI International, a Virginia-based intelligence and information technology consulting firm. Trump has vigorously criticized the invasion. Asked at a news conference about why he chose Kellogg despite his role in Iraq, Trump said: I dont have to agree with them but I have to hear different opinions. According to the Post, Papadopoulos previously advised Trumps former rival Ben Carson, who has now backed Trump. The London Center of International Law Practices Center website lists him as the head of its Center for International Energy and Natural Resources Law & Security. Page serves as a managing partner of Global Energy Capital, a private energy services company, the Post said. Sessions is not seen as an influential foreign policy or national security player in the U.S. Congress. He does not serve on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, although he is a member of the Armed Services Committee. Last week, Trump said in a television interview on MSNBC, which had been pressing him to name his foreign advisory team, that he relied on his own instinct. Im speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain, he told MSNBC. I know what Im doing. ... My primary consultant is myself. ",politicsNews,"March 21, 2016 ",1

Liberal groups stage rallies to back Obama's Supreme Court pick,"DES MOINES, Iowa (Reuters) - Liberal groups allied with the White House staged rallies around the country on Monday to pressure Republican senators including the Judiciary Committees chairman not to block President Barack Obamas Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. At the same time, a conservative group, the Judicial Crisis Network, said it launched a $2 million, three-week television, radio and digital advertising campaign in Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, New Hampshire, North Dakota and West Virginia opposing Garlands confirmation. The group is backing the stance of Senate Republicans including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell not to hold confirmation hearings or a vote on Garlands nomination. In Iowas capital, demonstrators targeted Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, whose panel handles confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominees. More than 50 protesters gathered on the sidewalk outside a federal building where Grassley has an office, chanting do your job as a plane pulling a banner carrying the same message flew overhead. Liberal groups including MoveOn.org organized rallies targeting Republicans in their home states during the Senates two-week spring recess in states including Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. The rallies generally drew crowds in the dozens, organizers said. I have called Grassleys office every week for the last two or three weeks and it doesnt seem like hes getting the message, so I need to find another way to do this, said Des Moines demonstrator Tracey Aubrecht, a 44-year-old homemaker from North Liberty, Iowa. State Senator Rob Hogg, one of the four Democrats running in a primary for a chance to challenge Grassley in the Nov. 8 election, attended the rally. The nomination requires confirmation by the Republican-led Senate. Republicans have said they want the next president to make the selection, hoping their party wins the presidential election. Garland, a centrist appellate judge and former prosecutor, was picked last week to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died Feb. 13. His appointment could tip the court leftward for the first time in decades. The White House said Vice President Joe Biden will deliver remarks on Garlands nomination at Georgetown Law School on Thursday. It said Garland also will continue meeting senators individually, speaking with Democrats Charles Schumer of New York and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania on Tuesday and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota on Wednesday.  Both sides have promised intensive campaigns on the ground and over the airwaves that will eclipse other battles over Supreme Court nominees in recent decades. Garland remains relatively unknown among Americans. Roughly one out of every five people say they are somewhat or very familiar with him, a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from Thursday to Monday found. Among those who have heard of Garland, half expressed a favorable opinion, including 60 percent of Democrats and 43 percent of Republicans. ",politicsNews,"March 21, 2016 ",1
White House opposes bill it says harms FTC consumer protection ability,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Monday that the Obama administration strongly opposes passage by the House of Representatives a bill on mergers and acquisitions, saying it harms a federal agencys ability to promote competition and protect consumers.  Proposed changes to the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act of 2015, sponsored by Representative Blake Farenthold, a Texas Republican, threaten to undermine the (Federal Trade Commissions) important role in protecting competition and consumers, the White House said in a statement.

Justices hostile to Virginia Republicans in black voters case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Supreme Court justices on Monday signaled they are likely to leave in place a lower-courts ruling that Virginias Republican-led legislature unlawfully considered race when drawing U.S. congressional districts by packing black voters into one of them. The court heard oral arguments in the case at a time when Democrats are accusing Republicans in various states of taking actions to reduce the influence of black, Hispanic and other voters who often favor Democrats. The focus of the case is on the composition of the majority-black U.S. House of Representatives district held by Democrat Bobby Scott, the only black member of Virginias congressional delegation. The eight justices, down one following the Feb. 13 death of conservative Antonin Scalia, heard an appeal by current and former Republican House members challenging the June 2015 lower court ruling that threw out the district. Following that ruling, some black voters from Scotts district were moved to an adjoining district, which is currently represented by white Republican Randy Forbes, one of the challengers in the case. This is likely to make the district a possible Democratic pickup in the Nov. 8 election. Without Scalia, the court could split 4-4 with its four liberals on one side and four conservatives on the other, which would leave intact the lower-court decision. None of the courts liberals indicated they are likely to back the Republican challengers. The court may not even decide the merits of the case. The justices could instead rule that House members from adjoining districts do not have legal standing to challenge new boundary lines that imperil their re-election prospects. Some of the justices signaled hostility to the idea that elected House members should receive legal protection when their ability to win re-election is put in doubt. This is now an incumbency-protection standing rule, liberal Sonia Sotomayor said of the challengers legal argument. Liberal Elena Kagan said even if lawmakers suffered an injury, the question remains whether they have a legally recognized interest in their re-election prospects. Several voters in Scotts district challenged the redistricting plan, approved by the Republican-led legislature in 2012, saying it minimized minority voting power in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitutions guarantee of equal protection under the law. The voters who brought the case in 2013 argued that the district that Scott represents, stretching from Richmond to Norfolk, was racially gerrymandered, cramming black voters into it and reducing black influence in neighboring districts. A ruling is due by the end of June. The case is Wittman v. Personhuballah, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-1504. ",politicsNews,"March 21, 2016 ",1
U.S. climate envoy Stern to step down: State Department,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern, who helped hammer out an international agreement in Paris last year to curb carbon emissions and spur development of clean technologies will step down on April 1, the State Department said on Monday. Stern, who was climate envoy for seven years, played an enormous role in achieving so many of our climate milestones, and the tireless work by Todd and his team over many years will benefit future generations in every corner of the globe, Secretary of State John Kerry said in a release. Stern will be replaced by Jonathan Pershing, a geologist, who has spent the last three years at the Department of Energy, serving as senior climate adviser to Ernest Moniz, the departments secretary. Fighting climate change has been one of President Barack Obamas top priorities. His administration, which is in its last year, says it can still meet its climate goals, despite the Supreme Courts putting a pause on his Clean Power Plan. The plan has helped prompt a wide ranging switch from coal-fired power plants to natural gas-burning plants, which release less carbon emissions.  ",politicsNews,"March 21, 2016 ",1
"FBI, Secret Service probe letter sent to Trump's sister: NBC","(Reuters) - U.S. authorities are investigating a threatening letter sent to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps sister, a federal appeals court judge in Philadelphia, according to NBC News. Maryanne Trump Barry, 78, received the letter on Friday, the networks Philadelphia affiliate said in a report late on Sunday, citing a source familiar with the investigation.  Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. Separately on Friday, officials said they were investigating a letter sent to Trumps son Eric that contained a granular substance.  The FBI and the U.S. Secret Service are investigating the letter to Trumps sister. The source told NBC that letter did not contain any white powder but did have the same threatening message that demands Trump drop his bid to be the Republican presidential nominee. Trump is leading among the three remaining Republicans campaigning to represent the party in the Nov. 8 presidential election. ",politicsNews,"March 21, 2016 ",1
"Trump 'needs all the help he can get,' donors say","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump often tells crowds at his campaign rallies that he doesnt need outside financial support to get to the White House, but some of his fans are starting to feel differently. Donors to an independent political spending group formed to promote Trumps candidacy said in interviews on Sunday they were worried by reports describing the millions of dollars Trumps opponents are spending to attack him. They said they admired the billionaire businessmans professed financial independence but thought a cash boost would help keep his fight for the Republican U.S. nomination fair. So 767 people sent in small sums - $25 here, $100 there - hoping it would help prepare him to face his many, moneyed foes. He needs all the help he can get, said Diane Abair, 83, a real estate agent in Redding, California, who sent $50 to the group, Great America PAC. She said she didnt think her donation tarnished Trumps claim that he wont have to pander as president to any special interest groups because hes not backed by big donors. Im not somebody that he can be beholden to, she said. Trump is facing an onslaught of attacks from other Republicans alarmed by his success, even after controversial statements like his call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. Big donors who demurred for months have begun to spend heavily to defeat him. This poses a new challenge for the candidate, who has so far spent less than his opponents. Between June and February, he loaned his campaign $24 million and raised nearly $10 million more from small donors.  Hope Hicks, Trumps spokeswoman, did not respond to a request for comment. Great America raised just under $74,000 during the first two months of 2016, according to regulatory filings. Its co-chair, Eric Beach, said it had taken in enough since then to commit to  spending $1 million on pro-Trump ads. Beach, a California businessman and political strategist, gave $25,000. When it comes time for the general election I hope the PAC has got some money left because hes going to need it, said Scott Abadie, 54, a veterinarian in New Orleans who donated $100 to Great America PAC. The group gives $5 of each donation it receives directly to Trumps campaign. According to co-founder Amy Kremer, this allows each donor to be named individually on financial reports. They too can be recognized for even a small donation, she said. ",politicsNews,"March 21, 2016 ",1
Good U.S.-Cuba ties are in Russia's interests: Kremlin,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin on Monday commented on U.S. President Barack Obamas historic visit to Cuba, saying it was in Russias interests for Havana, its long-time ally, to have good relations with the United States. Decades of friendly partner-like relations link Russia and Cuba, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a teleconference with reporters. We are interested in Cuba, which is friendly to us, maintaining good relations with all its neighbors and above all with the United States.

"With costly fight ahead against Trump, Cruz courts new donors","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz is leaning on new sources of cash as he prepares for a long primary fight against front-runner Donald Trump, with new campaign finance filings showing the expense of competing against a billionaire adept at grabbing headlines. Cruzs more traditional campaign has struggled to compete with Trump. The U.S. senator from Texas poured money into advertising, staff and calls to voters, spending $5.6 million more in February than he raised as he tried to outmaneuver Trump, according to campaign finance records made public on Sunday. But the effort had a limited impact as Trump took a commanding lead in the delegate count for the Republican nomination while spending a little more than half what Cruz did. The real estate mogul has loaned his campaign more than $24 million since he entered the race for the White House.  Now, with establishment Republican rivals Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio out of the race, Cruz is trying to win votes and rake in money by arguing the party should unite behind him if it hopes to defeat Trump.  Its a tough proposition for a conservative candidate who has long rankled the establishment wing of his party, including by leading a fight over President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law that led to a 16-day shutdown of the federal government. Cruz now hopes to convince his party that he, not Ohio Governor John Kasich, the other Republican remaining in the race, is best poised to defeat Trump and go on to the Nov. 8 presidential election. In a sign of Cruzs warming ties with establishment Republicans, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who has been a vocal critic of Cruz, plans on Monday to hold a fundraiser for the senator from Texas. Charles Foster, a Houston immigration attorney who backed Bush until he left the race in February, said Friday he is urging establishment Republicans to line up behind Cruz. My pitch to them simplistically is that Trump is an existential threat. Hed be a total disaster, Foster said. The only person that has a real chance, he added, particularly within the Republican primary base, which is conservative, far more conservative than Kasich, is Ted. Trump has a substantial lead in the Republican White House race, though he remains far short of the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination. It is unclear whether he will hit that number before the July convention in Cleveland, but it would also be difficult for either Cruz or Kasich to catch him. Cruz could pick up delegates in Utah, which holds its caucus on Tuesday, and all of the candidates are expected to compete hard in Wisconsin on April 5. But so far, efforts to stop the Trump juggernaut have made little impression on voters. In February, Cruz raised $11.9 million and spent $17.5 million, leaving his campaign with $8 million when he woke up on Super Tuesday. And despite the heavy spending, Cruz won just one state that voted in February and three on the March 1 Super Tuesday primaries. In addition to self-funding his campaign, Trump has the advantage of running an operation that leans heavily on free media exposure. In February, Trump, raised $9.2 million, including a $6.9 million loan he gave his own campaign, and spent $9.5 million. Kasich raised $3.4 million in February and spent $3.6 million. About half of Cruzs spending, or more than $8.7 million, was on advertising. Cruz also allotted $2.6 million to traditional campaign tactics like printing mailers, postage stamps and phone calls to voters. Cruz did spend a bit less than Trump on staff, recording $342,525 in payroll costs in February to Trumps $370,973. Jeff Roe, Cruzs campaign manager, said on Twitter on Sunday the campaign has enough cash to continue competing through June 7, the last Republican primary day when hundreds of delegates are up for grabs.

Obama in Cuba on historic visit,"HAVANA (Reuters) - President Barack Obama arrived to small but cheering crowds on Sunday at the start of a historic visit to Cuba that opened a new chapter in U.S. engagement with the islands Communist government after decades of hostility between the former Cold War foes. The three-day trip, the first by a U.S. president to Cuba in 88 years, is the culmination of a diplomatic opening announced by Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro in December 2014, ending an estrangement that began when the Cuban revolution ousted a pro-American government in 1959. Its a historic opportunity to engage directly with the Cuban people, Obama told staff at the newly reopened U.S. Embassy who were gathered at a hotel, his first stop after arriving in the afternoon. Groups of Cubans watched the motorcade from balconies and backyards as Obama was driven downtown, where a small crowd of Cubans braved a tropical downpour and tight security. They chanted: Viva Obama, Viva Fidel, as the president and his family left after eating dinner in a rundown neighborhood.  Obama, who abandoned a longtime U.S. policy of trying to isolate Cuba, wants to make his policy shift irreversible even if a Republican wins the White House in the Nov. 8 election. But major obstacles remain to full normalization of ties, and the Democratic presidents critics say the visit is premature. U.S. officials concede the trip may not yield immediate concessions from Cuba on rights and economic freedom. On Sunday, one bystander shouted: Down with the blockade, in reference to the U.S. embargo in place for 54 years that remains the top irritant for Cubans. Obama, who responded to the shout by raising his right hand, has asked Congress to rescind the embargo but has been blocked by the Republican leadership. Underscoring the ideological divide that persists between Washington and Havana, Cuban police, backed by hundreds of pro-government demonstrators, broke up the regular march of a leading dissident group, the Ladies in White, detaining about 50 people just hours before Obama arrived.    Obama arrived at Havanas Jose Marti International Airport in Air Force One, the presidential jet with United States of America emblazoned across its fuselage, a sight almost unimaginable not long ago on the island, just 90 miles (145 km) off the coast of Florida. He was met by Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez, the top Cuban official present. The formal welcoming ceremony will be on Monday when Obama meets the Cuban president at the presidential palace. U.S. officials appeared unfazed by Castros absence from the airport welcome, even though he personally met and greeted Pope Francis in September. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump tweeted that Obamas visit was a big deal but that he got no respect. Obama will hold talks with Castro  but not his brother Fidel, the revolutionary leader - and speak to entrepreneurs on Monday. He meets privately with dissidents, addresses Cubans live on state-run media and attends an exhibition baseball game on Tuesday. The trip carries both symbolism and substance after decades of hostility between Washington and Havana. Traveling with first lady Michelle Obama, her mother and their daughters, Sasha and Malia, Obama took in the sights of the colonial-era neighborhood and was given a tour of Havanas 18th century cathedral by Cardinal Jaime Ortega, who played a role in secret talks that led to the rapprochement 15 months ago. The Obamas dined at the San Cristobal restaurant, run by an Afro-Cuban as part of a cautious opening to private enterprise since Fidel Castro handed power to his brother in 2008. The trip makes Obama the first sitting American president to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge arrived on a battleship in 1928 and may help chip away at barriers to U.S.-Cuba trade and travel. Since rapprochement, the two sides have restored diplomatic ties and signed commercial deals on telecommunications and scheduled airline service. Obama has used executive authority to loosen trade and travel restrictions to advance his outreach to Cuba, one of his top foreign policy priorities along with the Iran nuclear deal. Cuba still complains about U.S. control of the naval base at Guantanamo Bay under a 1934 lease agreement that Havana says is no longer valid and that Obama has said is not up for discussion. Havana is unhappy with U.S. support for dissidents and anti-communist radio and TV programs beamed into Cuba. Speaking to reporters, Foreign Trade and Foreign Investment minister Rodrigo Malmierca Daz said before the U.S. presidents arrival that Obamas regulatory moves go in the right direction. But he added: We cant reach a normalization of relations with the blockade still in effect. The Americans in turn criticize one-party rule and repression of political opponents, an issue that aides said Obama would address publicly and privately. Obamas critics at home accuse him of making too many concessions for too little in return from the Cuban government and of using his trip to take an unearned victory lap. Obamas first words to the Cuban people came in a message on Twitter, a social media service that few Cubans can use regularly because of government restrictions on Internet access. Qu bol Cuba? he said, using Cuban slang for whats up? Just touched down here, looking forward to meeting and hearing directly from the Cuban people. Little progress on the main issues is expected when Obama and Castro meet on Monday or at a state dinner that evening. Instead, the highlights are likely to be Obamas speech on live Cuban television on Tuesday, when he will also meet dissidents and attend an exhibition baseball game between Major League Baseballs Tampa Bay Rays and Cubas national team.

Democrat Sanders outraised Clinton in February: report,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders outraised rival Hillary Clinton in February but spent at a faster pace, leaving him with less money, the Washington Post reported on Sunday. Sanders raised $43.5 million in the month, compared with  Clinton, who raised $30.1 million. The U.S. senator from Vermont has amassed much of his fundraising haul from online donations driven by supporters contributing small amounts of money. While Sanders raised more than Clinton, he also spent more than the former secretary of state. At the end of February, Sanders had $17.2 million in cash remaining, the Post said. Clinton had $31 million, according to her campaign. ",politicsNews,"March 21, 2016 ",1
Cuba breaks up weekly dissident march hours before Obama visit,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuban police backed by hundreds of shouting pro-government demonstrators broke up a march by the dissident group Ladies in White on Sunday, detaining about 50 people hours before U.S. President Barack Obama was due for a historic visit.  The women and their male supporters carried out their normal Sunday demonstration calling for free speech and amnesty for political prisoners after attending Roman Catholic Mass in an upscale neighborhood. A similar but less intense scene plays out every Sunday. This one was much more raucous, with a larger-than-normal crowd of pro-government demonstrators. Both sides appeared more animated in front of the unusual contingent of foreign journalists, many in town for the first visit by a U.S. president in 88 years. The Ladies marched toward the much larger pro-government crowd, which was shouting: These streets belong to Fidel, referring to retired leader Fidel Castro. When the two groups met at an intersection, the Ladies tossed leaflets into the air and sat down, at which point police seized them and wrestled them into buses. Most allowed themselves to be taken away but others went kicking and screaming. As the detainees were driven away, the counter-demonstrators banged on the windows. Some Ladies flashed back the L sign for Liberty, formed by a thumb and forefinger. The dissidents are usually released after a few hours.   Such short-term detentions have increased in recent months, according to the dissident Cuban Commission of Human Rights and National Reconciliation, which has reported 1,000 a month since October, up from a previous monthly average of more than 700. Obama will meet dissidents at the U.S. Embassy on Tuesday, heightening tensions between two governments that only restored diplomatic relations last year after a 54-year break. The leader of the Ladies in White, Berta Soler, has been invited to meet Obama. She was among those detained on Sunday.  In a letter dated March 10, Obama promised the Ladies he would raise the issues of freedom of speech and assembly with Cuban President Raul Castro.  The Cuban government dismisses dissidents as mercenaries seeking to destabilize the country. Many dissidents are funded by U.S. interests, which the Cuban government uses to discredit them. Dissidents say they have no choice but to take foreign money since their careers are derailed once they become opponents. Cuba defends its universal healthcare and education as human rights and criticizes the U.S. record on race relations and the Guantanamo Bay military prison. ",politicsNews,"March 20, 2016 ",1
Colombia's FARC rebels to meet Kerry in Cuba during Obama trip,"HAVANA/BOGOTA (Reuters) - Members of Colombias Marxist FARC guerrillas will meet U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in Cuba, a spokeswoman for Colombias government peace negotiators said on Sunday, adding a twist to a historic visit to the island by U.S. President Barack Obama. The meeting with Kerry on Monday will be the first time a U.S. secretary of state has met the negotiators from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, who have been talking peace with the Colombian government in Havana for more than three years. At around 4 p.m. (2000 GMT), the meeting between Kerry and the FARC delegation will take place, after the Colombian government delegation meet him, the spokeswoman said. A source at Colombias Office of the High Commissioner for Peace said the rebels and Colombian government negotiators would also go to an exhibition game between Major League Baseballs Tampa Bay Rays and Cubas national team on Tuesday. That game will be attended by Obama, who on Sunday became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Cuba in nearly 90 years. But FARC negotiator Pastor Alape said he was not aware of an invitation to attend the baseball game. He said that before meeting with Kerry, the rebels would meet the U.S. special envoy for Colombian peace talks, Bernard Aronson, to agree on an agenda.  The United States sees the Colombian peace talks hosted in Havana as an example of how restoring normal relations with Cuba can help its wider goals in Latin America. Latin Americas longest war has killed some 220,000 people and displaced millions of others since 1964. The government and rebels are attempting to reach a deal that would be placed before Colombian voters for approval, with a U.N. mission supervising rebel disarmament.  Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and FARC leader  Rodrigo Londono, better known by the nom de guerre Timochenko, had set a self-imposed March 23 deadline to reach a comprehensive pact but have since conceded that goal may not be reached. Washington designated the FARC as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997, and many of its leaders have been indicted in the United States on charges of cocaine trafficking.

Trump refuses to condemn violence at his U.S. presidential rallies,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said that professional agitators bore much of the blame for violence at his rallies as video showed a protester being beaten and another apparently being grabbed by Trumps campaign manager. Speaking on ABCs This Week on Sunday, Trump defended campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and declined to condemn supporters who have attacked protesters at his increasingly chaotic rallies.  Nor did he back down from his warning that there would be riots in the streets if the Republican Party denied him the nomination for the November election, despite his being the most popular candidate among Republican voters.  Senior figures in the party are openly plotting to prevent Trump from becoming the nominee because they view him as insufficiently conservative, and Trump was due to privately meet with some party leaders in Washington on Monday, the Washington Post reported. I dont know whats going to happen, but I will say this, youre going to have a lot of unhappy people, he said on This Week, predicting anger at the partys national convention in July should someone else end up the nominee. I dont want to see riots, I dont want to see problems. But youre talking about millions of people. Scenes of mayhem have become increasingly common at the billionaire New York businessmans rallies, which have been frequently interrupted by protesters, many of them Democrats, who say Trumps controversial remarks on immigrants and Muslims are dangerous. The 69-year-old candidate has sometimes encouraged his supporters using violence on protesters, and on at least one occasion said that he would like to punch a protester himself. Television footage from an Arizona rally on Saturday showed a man punching and kicking a protester as he was led out of the event. Another video appeared to show Lewandowski grabbing a protester by the back of his shirt.  Trump declined to condemn the violence and said it was often provoked by protesters, who briefly blocked a highway leading to an Arizona rally on Saturday. These people are very disruptive people. Theyre not innocent lambs, he said. He also defended Lewandowski and said a security official had actually grabbed the protester. Lewandowski also manhandled a reporter last week, according to the Washington Post. I give him credit for having spirit, Trump said of Lewandowski. Republican leaders have said Trump needs to more clearly discourage his supporters from engaging in violence.  About two dozen senior Republican figures will meet with Trump at a law firm near the Capitol on Monday afternoon in what the Trump campaign described as an effort to improve party unity, the Washington Post reported. The newspaper did not say who would be attending. Candidates were also required to submit their most recently monthly financial disclosures to the Federal Election Commission on Sunday. Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic Partys nomination, raised $30.1 million in February, according to filings, about $12 million less than that raised by chief rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the same period. Clinton began March with $31 million in cash on hand, according to filings. ",politicsNews,"March 20, 2016 ",1
Hillary Clinton raised $30.1 million in February,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton raised $30.1 million in February, and began Super Tuesday with $31 million in cash remaining, her campaign said on Sunday. Clinton has frequently dominated the fundraising contest, but has in recent months been in a tight money battle with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, her rival for the Democratic nomination for the November election. Clinton has been trying to increase her fundraising online, an arena where Sanders has dominated, raising small-dollar donations from supporters. Clintons campaign said that in mid-March the campaign exceeded 1 million donors.  Thanks to the 1 million people who have now contributed to our campaign and the more than 8.6 million people who have supported Hillary Clinton with their votes (in primaries and caucuses), we have the resources we need to continue to run a strong campaign all across the country and a nearly insurmountable pledged delegate lead, campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement. With the majority of our fundraising coming from grassroots online donations, this campaign continues to gain momentum and feed off the energy of millions of supporters across the country. Democrats will gather in Philadelphia in July to nominate their presidential candidate. The nominee will face the Republicans pick in November. ",politicsNews,"March 20, 2016 ",1
McConnell rules out action this year on high court,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Sunday ruled out Senate confirmation of Democratic President Barack Obamas Supreme Court nominee this year, even if after the November election it appears the next president may pick a liberal who Republicans would like even less. In television interviews, McConnell said Republican senators had no intention of confirming Democrat Obamas nominee, Merrick Garland, even if Democrats win the White House in November, putting them in the position to nominate someone more liberal than Garland when the new president takes office in January. I cant imagine that a Republican-majority Congress, in a lame-duck session, after the American people have spoken (in the election), would want to confirm (Garland), McConnell told CNN. Thats not going to happen, McConnell told Fox News on Sunday. The principle is the same, whether its before the election or after the election. The principle is the American people are choosing their next president and their next president should pick this Supreme Court nominee. Nominees to the lifetime Supreme Court post require Senate confirmation. But McConnell says the Republican-run Senate will not hold a hearing or a vote on Garland. Republicans have said they want the next president to make the selection, hoping their party wins Novembers election. Billionaire businessman Donald Trump is the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination. Garland, 63, is widely viewed as a moderate, admired by both Democrats and Republicans. Republican Senators Orrin Hatch and Jeff Flake last week raised the possibility of Senate action on  Garland late this year if Democrats keep the White House in the Nov. 8 election.  McConnell seemed keen to shut down that idea on Sunday, saying the Republican majority would not want to confirm Garland even if it were soon to be in the minority. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid told Meet the Press that he thought the Republican facade against Garland would break, because some Republican senators already have said they would be willing to meet Garland, and one Republican - Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois - has said there should be a vote. McConnell is leading his Senate over the cliff.And I am telling everybody thats watching this, the senators arent going to allow that, Reid said. The White House said it would stand by Obamas nominee. We will stand by him from now until he is confirmed and hes sitting on the Supreme Court, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said on Fox News on Sunday. ",politicsNews,"March 20, 2016 ",1
Anti-Trump protesters block Arizona road; march in New York,"(Reuters) - Demonstrators briefly shut down an Arizona highway leading to a campaign rally for Donald Trump on Saturday while protesters rallied outside of Trump Tower in Manhattan to voice their opposition to the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination. Television news footage of the demonstration outside Phoenix showed dozens of protesters blocking traffic while holding signs that read Dump Trump and Shut Down Trump.  The demonstrators eventually started marching down the highway. Later, some were seen nearing the rally at Fountain Hills, Arizona, before Trump arrived. Three people were arrested, according to police in Maricopa County, where Joe Arpaio, a well-known critic of U.S. immigration policy and an ardent Trump supporter, serves as sheriff. Video posted on news website Arizona Centrals Facebook page showed a truck driving through a large group of protesters. Officers from the county police department worked to clear demonstrators from the motorists path. A woman is seen crying and shouting for officers to take responsibility to stop the vehicle, while a deputy sheriff shrugs at the suggestion.  Later at a rally in Tucson, Arizona, Trump said the protests were disgraceful, and thanked police. They arrested three people and everybody else left... They left! Trump said to roaring cheers from the audience. I love our police, but we should do a little bit more of that, youd have a lot less protesters, youd have a lot less agitators, said Trump, who is favored to win his partys nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Several demonstrations also broke out during the later rally, prompting police to escort out a number of people.  Footage of the Tucson rally shows an attendee punching and kicking one demonstrator who is being escorted out. The clip also shows police removing the attacker. Trump has come under fire from rivals for fueling unrest with his rhetoric. This week, he warned of riots if Republicans denied him the nomination at the partys convention. In Trumps home city of New York, about 1,000 demonstrators marched from Central Park to Trump Tower, the billionaire developers signature building on Fifth Avenue. The crowd of mostly young people chanted and carried placards denouncing Trump. Some said police used pepper spray on them as they marched from the park.  Police were seen taking at least one person into custody. A spokesman for the New York Police Department could not immediately confirm whether any arrests were made or whether pepper spray was used.  Arizona, where political parties will hold primary elections on Tuesday, shares a long stretch of border with Mexico, and is a flashpoint for the issue of illegal immigration into the United States. Trump has made illegal immigration the signature issue of his campaign, earning the endorsement of Arpaio, the outspoken sheriff.  Donald Trump has the right to be heard by the thousands of people who love him, support him and want him to be president of the United States, Arpaio told CNN. Later, the sheriff, wearing civilian clothes, introduced Trump at the rally.  Trump rallies have grown increasingly unruly as the months-long campaign has progressed. An event in Chicago a week ago was canceled after protesters swarmed the venue. Last weekend, a man was arrested when he attempted to rush the stage where Trump was addressing a rally in Ohio. In another incident, a man who was caught on video punching an anti-Trump protester in the face at a North Carolina rally was arrested and charged with assault. Trump leads in opinion polls ahead of Arizonas March 22 primary, according to a Real Clear Politics polling average, leading Senator Ted Cruz of Texas by 13 percentage points.

¿Qué bolá? Obama jokes with Cuban humorist in video,"HAVANA (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama tried out his comedic chops with some Spanish in a video he made with Cuban humorist Pnfilo ahead of a historic visit to Havana. Obama, who has won praise from professional comedians for his comic timing, is due to arrive in Cuba on Sunday. He shot a segment from the Oval Office in which he pretends to have a conversation with Pnfilo in Cuba. The two sides of the call were edited together in a video playing on the Havana U.S. embassys social media feeds and the YouTube channel of an official Cuban media outlet on Saturday. (bit.ly/1WyRvHZ) Pnfilo calls Washington looking for a weather forecast for Tuesdays exhibition game between Cubas national baseball team and the Tampa Bay Rays, a game Obama will intend. Instead of getting the weather service he ends up on the phone with Obama, asking if he is really speaking with the president. Yes, the real Obama. Whos this? the president says. Im Pnfilo from Cuba. The real Pnfilo? From the TV show? Obama asks. Pnfilo is shocked the president knows him, and Obama pretends to be equally star struck. No me digas. Qu bol? Obama says in Cuban slang. (You dont say. Whats up?) Pnfilo then engages the U.S. president in his trademark gentle social satire of Cuban life, joking about old cars and cramped living quarters. ",politicsNews,"March 20, 2016 ",1
Scalia death a blow to Obamacare contraception challengers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Christian groups asking the U.S. Supreme Court to exempt them from the requirement to provide insurance covering contraception under President Barack Obamas healthcare law face an uphill battle following Justice Antonin Scalias death last month. The remaining eight justices will consider seven related cases on whether nonprofit groups that oppose the requirement on religious grounds can object under a U.S. law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to a compromise version of the requirement offered by the Obama administration. Among those mounting objections are the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of Roman Catholic nuns that runs care homes for the elderly. The court, divided 4-4 between liberal and conservative justices without the conservative Scalia, is set to hear the case on Wednesday. Scalia was considered a reliable vote for the religious groups. In 2014, he was in the majority when the court ruled 5-4 that family-owned companies run on religious principles, including craft retailer Hobby Lobby Stores Inc, could object to the provision for religious reasons.  If the four conservatives who sided with Scalia in that case remain unified, the best result the challengers could get would be a 4-4 split. That would leave in place lower-court rulings that favored the Obama administration. Unless the courts four justices in the dissent in Hobby Lobby dramatically change their minds, the likely worst outcome for the government would be a 4-4 split, said Gregory Lipper, a lawyer with Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which filed a brief backing the Obama administration. Lawyers for the challengers forecast that they can win, citing among other things the fact that women can obtain alternative coverage via Obamacares online marketplace. The idea that the government doesnt have some other way to do this is really a pretty silly argument, said Mark Rienzi, a lawyer with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents the Little Sisters. The Christian groups object to a compromise first offered by the federal government in 2013. It allows groups opposed to providing insurance covering contraception on religious grounds to comply with the law without actually paying for the coverage required by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare. Groups can certify they are opting out by signing a form, which they submit to the government. The government then asks insurers to pick up the tab. The groups contend the accommodation infringes on their religious rights because it forces them to authorize the coverage for their employees, even if they are not paying for it. A ruling is due by the end of June. ",politicsNews,"March 20, 2016 ",1
Trump candidacy stirs alliance angst in Japan,"TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trumps portrayal of Japan as a free-rider on security is stirring worries in Tokyo about damage to its U.S. alliance, and could embolden hardliners keen to bolster Japans military in the face of a rising China. The U.S.-Japanalliance has been the lynchpin of Tokyos  security policy for decades, but worries have simmered in recent years as to whether Washington will continue to be willing and able to defend its key Asian ally.  Comments from the Republican Party frontrunner have done little to allay those fears. If somebody attacks Japan, we have to immediately go and start World War III, okay? If we get attacked, Japan doesnt have to help us, Trump said at a campaign speech late last year. Somehow, that doesnt sound so fair. Trump has also accused Japan of stealing jobs and criticized the U.S.-led 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact that Tokyo sees as vital for strategic as well as economic reasons.       If you listen to his comments (on security), the United States would become isolated so I think there is great anxiety for allied countries, Itsunori Onodera, who served as defense minister under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, told Reuters. Last year, Abe spent considerable political capital enacting controversial legislation that allows Japans military to defend friendly countries under attack, a major reinterpretation of the countrys pacifist constitution. It is incumbent on Japan to protect itself and its defense is necessary for the alliance to be maintained in the best possible posture, said a source close to Abe. Abe also wants to formally revise the post-war charter to further loosen limits on military action overseas. Most people consider Trump bad news, but for those who want to revise the constitution and strengthen the military, it actually provides a boost for their position, said a former Western diplomat still in touch with Japanese policymakers. As host to around 50,000 U.S. troops, Japan is vital to Washingtons rebalance of its economic and security focus to the Asia-Pacific region. Trump did not respond to requests for comments about the U.S.-Japan alliance. Both Washington and Tokyo are alarmed by Chinas increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea, where Beijing has territorial rows with several Southeast Asian nations. Japan has a separate dispute with China over tiny islands in the East China Sea. Like many Trump observers around the world, Japanese policy makers at first watched with amusement and then disbelief as the reality TV star and property tycoon garnered growing momentum. Only in recent weeks have they begun taking Trumps chances seriously and are now scrambling to find out who is advising him on security, another government source said.  Japanese policymakers have not geared up specifically to counter what they see as his misleading rhetoric, which seems to hark back to an outdated 1980s vision of Japan, the source close to Abe said. I think its too early. Number one, he has not made it known even to the American voters whom he counts on as far as foreign policy goals, the source said, adding they expected Trump would change if elected. We are fully aware campaign rhetoric is dramatically different from real policies pursued by incumbents.   For now, though, Japanese government insiders say they are betting that if Trump becomes the Republican nominee and goes on to win the Nov. 8 presidential election, he would surround himself with experts who would draft more realistic policies. Publicly, Japan is playing it politely. Asked about Trumps candidacy on Wednesday, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters: We are of course watching this because of the impact such a large country has, but we cannot otherwise comment on another countrys election.

Clinton's Asian-American outreach director leaving campaign,"(Reuters) - The director of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintons Asian American and Pacific Islander outreach efforts is leaving the campaign for a position with the Colorado Democrats, a campaign official said on Saturday. The departure of Lisa Changadveja comes ahead of Democratic nominating contests in states with the highest proportion of Asian American voters, like Washington later this month and California in June. She was an instrumental part of helping build our AAPI program and those efforts will continue with events over the next few weeks, campaign spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said in an email to Reuters. The campaign is expected to announce a new Director of AAPI Outreach very soon. Changadveja had announced her departure to campaign supporters in an email dated March 18, saying she had tremendous faith in the campaigns commitment and ability to continue engaging our community as we move through the rest of the primary and prepare for the general election. I will be leaving Hillary for America as I have recently accepted a new job at the Colorado Democratic Party, she said in the email, seen by Reuters. Changadveja did not immediately return requests for comment.     Minority communities have been key voting blocs for the Clinton campaign, helping her rack up wins over Bernie Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont who is her main rival for the Democratic nomination to the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders form about 6 percent of the U.S. population, a figure that does not include people of mixed race, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.  They make up nearly 15 percent of the population of California, which holds its nominating contest in June, and around 9 percent of the state of Washington, which holds its Democratic caucus on March 26. Asian Americans have also been among the fastest-growing ethnic groups in the United States, on occasion outstripping the growth in the Latino population, according to the Census.  A study by the University of California, Los Angeles last year found that the Asian-American electorate will double to 12 million voters by 2040.  Changadveja joined the Clinton campaign in September, according to her LinkedIn page. She previously served as the LGBTQ and AAPI director for Ready for Hillary, a Super PAC that supported a Clinton run for the presidency, according to the page. ",politicsNews,"March 19, 2016 ",1
Obama allies to press Republicans on high court nomination,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As the Senate began a two-week recess on Friday, the White House and its allies sought to turn up the heat on Republicans to reverse course and act on President Barack Obamas Supreme Court nominee. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has pledged not to hold confirmation hearings or a vote on Obamas nomination on Wednesday of Merrick Garland, a centrist appeals court judge and former prosecutor, to the high court. Not all Senate Republicans want to block a vote on Garland. Senator Mark Kirk, locked in a tough re-election battle in Illinois, told WLS radio in Chicago that senators should just man up and cast a vote on the Garland nomination. Kirk broke with McConnell last month, calling for hearings and a vote on Obamas nominee. Conservative activists, however, vowed to fight in support of Republican leaders who insist that the next president, to be elected on Nov. 8 and take office in January, make the appointment, hoping their partys candidate wins. The conservative group Judicial Crisis Network said it would start a $2 million, three-week television, radio and digital advertising campaign in six states starting on Monday backing McConnells stance. Garland, 63, would replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13, on the nine-seat court. His appointment could tip the court leftward for the first time in decades. Liberal groups, including CREDO Action and MoveOn.org Civic Action, said they would rally at various locations on Monday calling on Senate Republicans to Do Your Job and put Garland through a full confirmation process.  One rally was planned for outsidethe Des Moines, Iowa office of Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee that would convene any hearings. The Iowa senator has said he opposes hearings but is open to meeting with Garland. The conservative ad campaign also is targeting Grassley. One senior Senate Republican aide, referring to pressures Grassley faces over the recess, speculated on the possibility he would return to Washington on April 4 more open to holding confirmation hearings. Two weeks in Iowa with Iowans screaming at him? the aide said. White House spokesman Josh Earnest indicated Vice President Joe Biden, a former Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, would lend his voice next week to administration efforts pressing for Garlands confirmation.  While Earnest said Biden can be a pretty persuasive advocate, Republicans have noted that Biden, as Judiciary Committee chairman in 1992, argued for postponing action on Supreme Court nominees during an election year.

Trump's 'obsession' with anchorwoman Kelly is 'deplorable': Fox,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fox News on Friday issued a harsh condemnation to Donald Trump in defense of one of the networks most popular reporters, calling the Republican front-runners obsession unfit for a presidential candidate. Donald Trumps vitriolic attacks against Megyn Kelly and his extreme, sick obsession with her is beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate, the conservative cable news network wrote in a statement. Megyn is an exemplary journalist and one of the leading anchors in America  were extremely proud of her phenomenal work and continue to fully support her throughout every day of Trumps endless barrage of crude and sexist verbal assaults.  The statement from Fox, which is part of the Rupert Murdoch-controlled Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, comes in response to a recent onslaught of negative comments from Trump to Kelly, resparking a months-long feud between the two.  The quarrel began in August when, during a Fox News-hosted Republican debate, Trump blasted Kelly over questions she posed to him regarding his history with women, including his references to some women he didnt like as dogs and fat pigs. Trump upped the ante shortly thereafter, saying that Kelly had become so incensed, you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her - wherever, which many viewed as Trump insinuating that Kelly was menstruating.  The Trump campaign later issued a statement saying that by her wherever, Trump meant Kellys nose. Still, the damage had been done, and the relationship between the billionaire businessman and the longtime Fox News anchor has remained strained.  Beginning Tuesday, Trump took to Twitter to blast Kelly, tweeting and retweeting a series of messages referring to her as Crazy Megyn, and calling for supporters to boycott her weeknight news program, The Kelly File. Everybody should boycott the @megynkelly show. Never worth watching. Always a hit on Trump! She is sick, & the most overrated person on tv, Trump tweeted on Friday. Fox News responded by saying: As the mother of three young children, with a successful law career and the second highest rated show in cable news, its especially deplorable for (Kelly)to be repeatedly abused just for doing her job. The Trump campaign stood by the negative tweets, calling Kelly highly overrated in a statement, and accusing her of biased reporting.  Unlike Megyn Kelly, who resorts to putting out statements via FOX News, Mr. Trump will continue to defend himself against the inordinate amount of unfair and inaccurate coverage he receives on her second-rate show each night, the campaign said.

"Romney offers vote, little else, to Cruz in Republican election battle","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Mitt Romney said on Friday he would vote for U.S. Senator Ted Cruz in Utahs presidential nominating contest, but the partys 2012 election standard-bearer stopped short of an official endorsement as he urged voters to deny the nomination to front-runner Donald Trump. In a Facebook post, Romney said a vote for Cruz in Utahs caucus on Tuesday was the best way to prevent Trump from locking down the nomination, which would give opponents a chance to select another candidate at the partys July convention. The only way we can reach an open convention is for Senator Cruz to be successful in as many of the remaining nominating elections as possible, Romney wrote. Romney did not offer any praise for Cruz, who emerged as a favorite of the partys most ardent conservatives after clashing with party leaders in Washington. Romney did not say whether or not he would campaign with Cruz, a first-term senator from Texas. Trump responded quickly. Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesnt have a clue. No wonder he lost! he wrote on Twitter. Cruz, acknowledging the tepid nature of Romneys support, said the pledged vote enforces the idea that his campaign is the only one that can beat Trump, likening a vote for Ohio Governor John Kasich, the third remaining Republican contender, to tacit support for Trump. In my book, when someone says Im voting for you, and I encourage everyone else to vote for you, thats pretty darn good, Cruz, a self-styled Washington outsider, told reporters in Arizona. And Ill take that and take that happily. Arizona also holds its nominating contest on Tuesday.  As Mitt Romney observed today, if you want to beat Donald Trump, Cruz is the only campaign that can do it. Thats why hes voting for me in Utah, Cruz said.  Romney has emerged as one of the most prominent critics of Trump, the billionaire businessman and reality-TV star who has become the surprise front-runner in the battle to secure the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election. Romney, who lost to Democratic President Barack Obama in 2012, called Trump a fraud and a dangerous demagogue who would lose to Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party front-runner, in November. Today, there is a contest between Trumpism and Republicanism, Romney wrote, adding that Trump has encouraged racism, misogyny and violence. I am repulsed by each and every one of these, he wrote. Kasichs campaign called Romneys turn to Cruz the result of bad political advice. This is just the old establishment trying again to game the political system, but John Kasichs defeated the Republican establishment his entire career, the campaign said.  Romneys support for Cruz comes a day after U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham threw his support behind the Texas senator, saying in similar fashion that Cruz has the best chance of stopping Trump, even though he thinks Kasich would have a better chance of winning in Novembers general election. Trump has continued to notch victories in the state-by-state nominating process as Republicans have failed to unite behind Cruz or Kasich. At this point, those who oppose Trump say their best bet is to prevent him from securing the 1,237 delegates he needs to lock up the nomination before the convention in Cleveland. So far, Trump has won 678 delegates. Cruz would need to win 81 percent of the remaining delegates to reach a majority, according to the Cook Political Report. It is impossible for Kasich to reach 1,237 delegates, according to the nonpartisan election tracker. Romney said Kasich has a solid record as a governor and he would have voted for him in Ohio last Tuesday.  ",politicsNews,"March 18, 2016 ",1

Mansion where Obama to stay in Havana 'built to impress',"HAVANA (Reuters) - The mansion in Havana where U.S. President Barack Obama and his family will spend two nights has survived war, revolution and an Albanian occupation. Now, with U.S.-Cuban diplomatic ties restored and overall relations warming, the U.S. ambassadorial residence is re-emerging as a center of influence on the Communist-ruled island.  Built from 1939 to 1942, the two-story building is more than half the size of the White House, according to U.S. State Department data, and was constructed with the finest materials and craftsmanship of the time. The United States abandoned it from 1961 to 1977 after the 1959 Cuban revolution overthrew a pro-American government and Washington severed ties with Fidel Castro, leaving the home to at first Albanian and later Swiss caretakers. The coral limestone exterior and marble floors and columns are both imposing and inviting, said one man who lived there and likened it to the finest U.S. ambassadorial residences in London or Paris or Buenos Aires. This is a place that was built to impress, said John Caulfield, who was Americas chief diplomat in Cuba from 2011 to 2014 and inhabited the upstairs two-bedroom, two-bath residential suite with a living room. The upper level also has four other large bedrooms with private baths, among them the presidential suite. Obama, Michelle Obama, their two daughters and the first ladys mother will stay there Sunday and Monday nights during the first visit by a U.S. president to Cuba in 88 years. The public and working areas are on the ground floor.     The State Department bought the land and built the residence as America was being drawn into World War Two and sought the profile of a nation on the rise. Its really an example of soft power. You walk through that door and it impresses. Its expensive, but not as expensive as an aircraft carrier, Caulfield said. The neighborhood, now known as Cubanacan, was called Country Club Park when it was built. The 5-acre (2-hectare) plot has a swimming pool and tennis court.  Not bad for public housing, Caulfield said. The highest ranking official to previously stay there was Vice President Richard Nixon in 1955. According to lore, it was built as a winter White House for President Franklin Roosevelt, who used a wheelchair. While the State Department could not confirm that, the elevator, ramps and wide doorways made it wheelchair-friendly 50 years before the Americans With Disabilities Act required such features in government buildings.

Sanders calls notion he should quit Democratic race 'absurd',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, responding to reports President Barack Obama called on Democrats to rally around Hillary Clinton as the likely nominee, said on Thursday it was absurd to suggest he drop out of the race. Obama privately told a group of Democratic donors last Friday that Sanders was nearing the point at which his campaign against Clinton would end, and that the party must soon come together to back her, the New York Times reported. Sanders, a Vermont senator and self-proclaimed democratic socialist, while saying he did not want to comment directly on Obamas reported remarks, pushed back on the idea that his campaign had run its course and he should throw in the towel.    The bottom line is that when only half of the American people have participated in the political process ... I think it is absurd for anybody to suggest that those people not have a right to cast a vote, Sanders told MSNBC in an interview. The White House on Thursday said Obama did not indicate which candidate he preferred in his remarks to the donors. Clinton, a former secretary of state in the Obama administration, has a large lead in the race for the Democratic nomination and she won all five states that were contested on Tuesday. Sanders said he will do better in upcoming contests in western states, after losing to Clinton in a number of southeastern states. To suggest we dont fight this out to the end would be, I think, a very bad mistake. People want to become engaged in the political process by having vigorous primary and caucus process. I think we open up the possibility of having a large voter turnout in November. That is exactly what we need, Sanders said. A low voter turnout, somebody like a Trump can win. High voter turnout, the Democratic candidate will win, he said, referring to Donald Trump, the front-runner in the race to pick the Republican nominee for the November presidential election.

Meet a man who will help determine Trump's fate in 2016 race,"(Reuters) - Mark Strang spends his days delivering farm equipment, listening to politics on the radio during cross-country drives. But in July, the 63-year-old could have an outsized voice in choosing the Republican nominee for president of the United States.  For the first time in 40 years, Republicans could arrive at their national convention in Cleveland without a nominee. If front-runner Donald Trump fails to lock up the nomination before then, as some pollsters are predicting, Strang will have a chance to make history. Strang, from Illinois, is one of 2,472 delegates to the convention who will ultimately determine the partys choice for the White House this November. In recent elections, the delegates have simply rubberstamped the presumptive nominee. But this year the convention could become a brutal fight in which every delegate vote will count. Trump currently has 673 delegates after winning a string of nominating contests, but if he wants to avoid a floor fight at the convention he needs the magic number of 1,237. There is some doubt among election number crunchers that he can hit it. And thats when Strang will step into the spotlight. After filling roles in local Republican politics, Strang was selected by Illinois voters to serve as a delegate for Republican candidate U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas. He likes Cruz for his position on guns and immigration.  But if the convention becomes a fight because no candidate has the needed 1,237 delegates on the first round of voting, most of the delegates would eventually be released. States are still sorting through some rules governing how long delegates are bound to candidates. Strang said if he found himself a free agent, he would be open to switching his vote. (Graphic on how a contested convention works: tmsnrt.rs/1ROtOHw) I am going to be loyal to Ted Cruz, and I will stick with him until I see if theres no hope. And if theres no hope for Ted getting in, as I understand it I can pledge my votes to somebody else, and I would hope Ted would understand, he said. Interviews with Republican state party officials and some delegates who have already been selected reveal widespread soul-searching in anticipation of a potential fight. Officials and delegates described weighing their personal preference with the need to rally around a candidate going into the general election.  Party faithful are steeling themselves for a battle, not just for the nomination, but also for the partys core values. Establishment Republicans deeply opposed to Trumps candidacy say he does not represent social and economic conservative values on healthcare, trade and the role of government in daily life.     Trump has built his campaign on anti-establishment rhetoric and promises to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep out illegal immigrants, impose a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and restore the countrys manufacturing base. A contested convention would pose a major test for Trumps campaign, which thus far has eschewed a traditional grassroots organization. His rivals, Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich, are already trying to lobby delegates who might be open to changing sides once they are allowed to become free agents in the convention. In every state, the party chair and two national committee members, a man and a woman, are automatically selected to be delegates. But from there, state parties use a wide variety of procedures to pick delegates, most of whom wont be named until late spring or summer. These are the base of the party, said Michigan Republican Party chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel. The delegates are not the establishment. They are the base. And I think thats a great misunderstanding. Often sporting outfits with homemade decorated hats or jackets weighed down with dozens of buttons, delegates who show up every four years include everyone from lawmakers to homemakers, and from those who write million dollar checks to retirees who make phone calls.  Many states use small conventions to pick delegates, many of whom are long-time party activists and elected office holders. Not all of them personally back the candidate they are pledged to support in the first round of convention voting, said Virginia Republican Party chairman John Whitbeck. We have two former governors, a former attorney general, state senators, state House of Delegates members, party leaders, big and small and donors, said Whitbeck.  In other states, such as Illinois, some delegates are elected by primary voters. In Ohio, which gives all its delegates to the statewide primary winner, candidates pick their own slate of convention representatives.  Jim Carns, a state representative from Alabama, where delegates are selected in the primaries, signed up to represent Trump last fall  when many still viewed the rise of the New York real estate mogul as a temporary phenomenon. He sees no circumstance in which he would switch candidates. But he knows there will be efforts to win over delegates by both the Trump camp and their opponents.  Once delegates are allowed to change their votes, some establishment figures have floated the potential to nominate someone who didnt even run for president  such as House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan. But most of the 14 delegates interviewed by Reuters dismissed that as an option.  I almost think that I would walk away from the Republican Party if they did that, said Strang, the Illinois delegate. If wed wanted Paul Ryan, we would have drafted him. And I dont dislike Paul Ryan, but he didnt run. Ryan has said he is not interested in the presidency. ",politicsNews,"March 18, 2016 ",1
Obama's Argentina trip raises questions about Macri rights record,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Celeste Perosino was investigating possible crimes committed by Argentinas central bank during the Dirty War military dictatorship decades ago before her team was disbanded by the new conservative President Mauricio Macri. Days ahead of President Barack Obamas arrival in Argentina for a rare visit by a U.S. leader, Perosino scoffs at praise from the White House for Macri as a strong voice for human rights. The decision to shut down the banks human rights office was a decision that we see as a form of political and ideological persecution, Perosino said. She is not the only one concerned. Obamas visit, which coincides with the March 24 anniversary of the 1976 coup that installed a military junta, initially supported by the United States, has riled victims of the seven-year dictatorship and raised questions about Macris credentials as a staunch defender of human rights.  Macri, who took office in December, has said that his leftist predecessor former President Cristina Fernandezs push to punish military repressors smacked of revenge.  His governments human rights office held its first meeting with families who suffered at the hands of leftist militants in the 1970s and early 80s, rather than victims of the militarys crimes.  Then, in February, the government reinstated the rights of military officials who participated in atrocities to receive treatment in military hospitals. Rights campaigners talk of troubling infringements on civil rights. Macri was criticized for the arrest of a popular community activist and came under fire for the polices use of rubber bullets against a community group rehearsing for Carnival that included children. The president has also moved to grant police increased powers to shut down public protests. Fernandez was widely praised by human rights groups and the left for re-opening trials dealing with abuses committed during the dictatorship, though right-wing opponents accused her of reopening old wounds.  The security forces killed up to 30,000 people. Many of them were forcibly disappeared - a euphemism for kidnapped and murdered - and hundreds of children were stolen from their imprisoned parents.     Macris human rights chief, Claudio Avruj, said the government is committed to defending human rights and that perpetrators of dictatorship-era crimes would continue to face trial. We categorically reject everything the military coup stood for, the persecution, the disappearance and death of Argentine and foreign citizens, Avruj said.      Obamas trip marks the first bilateral visit by a U.S. president to Argentina in nearly two decades. Relations soured sharply during Fernandezs leadership.  During last years presidential race, Macri pressed for Venezuelas suspension from the regional Mercosur trade bloc, citing alleged rights abuses by President Nicolas Maduros socialist government. President Macri has been a strong voice for democracy and human rights in Latin America, Obamas deputy security adviser, Ben Rhodes, said last month. But rights campaigners fret that Macri, whose PRO party has previously voted against investigating economic crimes under the dictatorship, is already unraveling some of the progress made under Fernandez.  At the central bank, Perosinos four-person team had been investigating financial crimes and how extensively civilian bank employees colluded with the military during the 1976-1983 crackdown against Marxist rebels, labor unions and other left-wing opponents. The team was established by Fernandez. Perosino said they were only six months into their work and were still in the early stages of pouring over the banks archives. Among lines of investigation, Perosino said she was delving into the kidnap and murder of five central bank employees, ties between the bank and the former SIDE spy agency, and how the bank helped large private companies which complied with the generals by assuming their debt.  A central bank spokesman said the office was shut down in January after it found nothing.   Our work wasnt close to being done, said Perosino, standing among protestors outside the central bank demonstrating against job cuts at the regulator. In a move to unearth new details about the Dirty War,  U.S. national security adviser Susan Rice on Thursday said the United States would declassify documents from U.S. military and intelligence agencies related to that period at the request of the Argentine government. Carlos Munoz, a graphic designer who survived imprisonment and torture in 1978 by agreeing to fabricate false documents for the military, said shedding new light on the dictatorship would be a welcome sign the United State is real about human rights. But he voiced concern that Macris record on human rights has been thin so far. We had made a lot of progress in ending dictatorship-era impunity. I hope that we dont go backwards, said Munoz.  In an open letter to Obama earlier this month, Argentine Nobel peace prize winner Adolfo Perez Esquivel urged the U.S. president to acknowledge that Washington was an accomplice in military coups throughout Latin America. Certainly you cannot deny that your country has many pending debts with our country, wrote Esquivel, who was tortured and detained without trial by the military junta. Esquivel on Friday hailed the declassification of more U.S. documents as an act of good faith.  Faced with the threat of anti-U.S. protests, Obama will meet Macri on March 23 and honor victims of the dictatorship era before spending the coup anniversary in the Patagonian city of Bariloche some 1,000 (1,600 km) miles away.

"Factbox: Build a giant wall, cut Education Department. What a President Trump would do","(Reuters) - Presidential candidate Donald Trump has been accused by some in his Republican Party of being vague on policy specifics and heavy on rhetoric. Here is a look at what the billionaire businessman, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, has said he would do on some of the big issues should he become the nominee and go on to win the Nov. 8 election. The policies are drawn from a review of his website, stump speeches, debates, town halls and televised interviews. Trump has complained that China, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam and India are ripping us off by devaluing their currencies and keeping out some U.S. exports. He would not sign the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact and would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. He has said he favors reaching trade agreements with individual countries as opposed to multilateral accords like the TPP. He would designate China a currency manipulator and impose countervailing duties on its exports. He also wants to pursue a World Trade Organization case on Chinese government programs that subsidize exporters. Trump has said he would put activist investor Carl Icahn in charge of negotiating a better trade relationship with China. Icahn has said he is happy to advise Trump, but would not seek a formal position if Trump was elected. Trump has said the United States should raise tariffs on foreign-made goods in response to reductions in interest rates by European Union nations and other countries, which he says could hurt manufacturing jobs at home. Trump has also said he would slap 35 percent tariffs on air conditioners made in Mexico by United Technologies Corps Carrier after the company decided to move production there from Indiana, and on Ford Motor Corp vehicles made in Mexico that are sold in the United States. Trump has pledged to cut and simplify taxes. Individuals making less than $25,000 per year and married filers earning less than $50,000 would not pay income tax. There would be three other tax brackets, down from seven currently, with a top marginal income tax rate of 25 percent, and a top rate for long-term capital gains and dividends of 20 percent. The current top marginal income tax rate is 39.6 percent and the current top rate for long-term capital gains is 20 percent. Deductions for charitable giving and mortgage interest would remain unchanged. Other deductions would be trimmed in the highest tax brackets. He would eliminate the alternative minimum tax, the estate tax, and the carried interest tax break that allows investment fund managers and some hedge fund managers to treat income as capital gains. The corporate tax rate would be cut to 15 percent, down from the current level of 35 percent.  Trump would phase in a reasonable cap on deductions for business interest expenses and would cut other corporate loopholes. Trump would impose a onetime 10 percent deemed repatriation tax on deferred corporate overseas profits and would end deferral of income from foreign subsidiaries. Trump would also move quickly to stop corporate inversions, in which a U.S. company acquires an overseas firm and reduces its tax bill by reincorporating overseas. He has offered no specifics. He has criticized Republicans and Democrats for being unable to halt inversions, saying, They cant make a deal because they dont have leadership. The Tax Foundation, an independent policy research group, has said Trumps plan would cost more than $10 trillion over the next decade. His campaign has said the plan is fully paid for. Trump has pledged to get rid of the $19 trillion federal deficit by boosting jobs and cutting government waste, but he has not released a formal policy paper on how he would do this. He has said he would not cut the Medicare and Medicaid healthcare programs for senior citizens and low-income Americans, nor Social Security retirement benefits. He would eliminate the Education Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump has promised to build a high wall at the U.S.-Mexico border to keep out illegal immigrants, which he has said would cost $10 billion to $12 billion. Mexico would pay for the wall or face consequences, his campaign said. Trump would impound remittance payments to Mexico from undocumented workers, and increase visa and border crossing fees for Mexican workers, as well as visa fees for Mexican chief executives and diplomats. Applying tariffs on Mexican goods and cutting foreign aid are also options, his campaign has said on his website. He would deport the 11 million illegal immigrants living in America and end birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to illegal immigrants. He has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and would not allow refugees from Syria. Trump would triple the number of border agents and require all businesses to use the E-Verify database to ensure employees are in the country legally. He would increase penalties for overstaying visas and would complete a visa tracking system. He would withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities that decline to help the federal government deport illegal immigrants. Trumps campaign has also said he would pause new green cards and require employers to hire American workers first. Trump has said he would seek repeal of the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. He would still require insurers to provide coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions, a key feature of Obamacare. He would allow prescription drugs to be imported and would turn the Medicaid program for the poor into block grants for the states. His plan also calls for full deduction of health insurance premiums from income tax. He would move to allow insurance companies to sell plans across state lines to spur competition.   He would allow individuals to use tax-free Health Savings Accounts, which he says should be allowed to accumulate and be passed on to a persons heirs. Currently, Health Savings Accounts, which were created as part of Obamacare, can be used only with high-deductible health plans. They are tax free and can accumulate and be rolled over into a retirement account when a person is ready for Medicare. Trump has said he could save the government $300 billion by negotiating better prices with drug companies. He would require price transparency from all healthcare providers, especially doctors and organizations like clinics and hospitals, to enable individuals to find the best prices for exams or other procedures. Trump has promised to knock out Islamic State quickly and said he is open to working with Russia to do so. He has said he would consider putting 20,000 to 30,000 U.S. troops on the ground to defeat Islamic State militants and has vowed to complete the mission swiftly and bring troops home to focus on rebuilding the United States. He has said he would bomb the oil that helps finance the insurgent group and stop the back channels of banking used by the group. He has vowed to bring back the use of waterboarding, an interrogation technique that simulates drowning and has been banned as torture under U.S. law. He said he also supports other, unspecified techniques a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding. He has said he would not order the U.S. military to break international laws on how to treat terrorism suspects , but has also said he would seek to have those laws broadened. He would take out the family members of Islamic State militants and would like to shut down areas of the Internet to try to stop the group from recruiting members. He wants to build a safe zone for Syrian refugees in Syria. But Gulf states would have to pay for it. He has said the United States should first deal with Islamic State before addressing the future of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, saying, We have to do one thing at a time. He has questioned whether the United States should back opposition groups in Syria, saying, We have no idea who they are. Trump has said he would increase the size and power of the U.S. military to make it so strong, so powerful that nobodys going to mess with us. He says too much money is wasted buying equipment the military does not want. He wants Japan, Germany, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to bear more of the cost of military aid provided by the United States. We can no longer defend all of these countries, he said, citing the deficit. Trump would boost the U.S. military presence in the East and South China seas to discourage Chinese adventurism, according to his website. ",politicsNews,"March 18, 2016 ",1
Romney says he will vote for Cruz in Utah presidential caucus,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on Friday announced he will vote for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in Utahs Tuesday nominating contest, citing a desire to halt the momentum of party front-runner Donald Trump.  Today, there is a contest between Trumpism and Republicanism. Through the calculated statements of its leader, Trumpism has become associated with racism, misogyny, bigotry, xenophobia, vulgarity and, most recently, threats and violence. I am repulsed by each and every one of these, Romney, the 2012 Republican Party nominee, wrote on Facebook. The only path that remains to nominate a Republican rather than Mr. Trump is to have an open convention, he said. At this stage, the only way we can reach an open convention is for Senator Cruz to be successful in as many of the remaining nominating elections as possible. ",politicsNews,"March 18, 2016 ",1
Illinois lawmaker's daughter charged in political staple attack,"(Reuters) - A daughter of an Illinois state representative has been charged with participating in an attack on one of her mothers  political rivals that included using a staple gun on the victims forehead, police and the victim said on Friday. Jessica Soto and Bradley Fichter, both 26 and of Chicago, have been charged with three counts of aggravated battery in a March 6 attack on Robert Zwolinski, who was defeated in a primary this month by Sotos mother, state Representative Cynthia Soto, Chicago police said.  Lawyers for the two were not immediately available for comment. The attack took place outside of Zwolinskis campaign office. Frank Avila, a lawyer for the couple, told local media that  Zwolinski started the fight and possibly put a stable in his own head for attention. Avila identified Soto as the daughter of Representative Soto and denied the daughter was part of the attack.  Police said Zwolinski was hit with a metal object and glass bottle. Zwolinski said the metal object was the staple gun and he had his forehead repeatedly stapled by the pair. The night of the fight, Zwolinski posted photos on social media of a staple sticking out of his forehead, a bloodied face, and a swollen nose. The girl was yelling, while I was on the ground fighting the man off of me, This is Sotos territory! This isnt your territory, Zwolinski said.  Representative Soto could not immediately be reached.

Ex-Connecticut Governor Rowland appeals conviction,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former Connecticut Governor John Rowland on Friday urged a federal appeals court to overturn his conviction on charges that the Republican tried to use sham contracts to hide his political work in two U.S. congressional campaigns, saying prosecutors went too far in applying the law. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York heard arguments over whether Rowland used illegal consulting contracts for candidates who in 2010 and 2012 ran unsuccessfully for the House of Representatives. Rowland, who was sentenced to 2-1/2 years in prison in March 2015, is free on bail during his appeal. He had previously spent 10 months in prison following his 2004 guilty plea to separate charges arising from his acceptance of illegal gifts while he was governor. Rowland resigned from office that year. Andrew Fish, Rowlands lawyer, told the appeals court on Friday that a draft contract rejected by one of the candidates, Mark Greenberg, did not constitute a falsified document. Frankly, the government saying that a contract proposal is a falsified document makes little sense, Fish said. He said prosecutors went too far in trying to criminalize Rowlands conduct under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, a governance law passed after Enron Corps collapse, that prohibits falsifying documents to hide financial wrongdoing. Assistant U.S. Attorney Liam Brennan countered that the case was in the heartland of the statute. This is creating a fake record to have in the file in case there is an investigation, he said. A federal jury in New Haven found Rowland guilty in March 2015 on charges of conspiracy, falsifying records in a federal investigation, causing false statements to be made to the Federal Election Commission, and causing illegal campaign contributions. Prosecutors said Rowland, 58, sought to advise Greenberg, who testified that in 2010 he rejected Rowlands offer and a contract to conceal the ex-governors role. Rowland was also accused of negotiating a deal to work for a nursing home company owned by Brian Foley, the husband of 2012 congressional candidate, Lisa Wilson-Foley, and receive $35,000 intended to compensate him for advising her campaign. Wilson-Foley and Foley pleaded guilty to conspiring to make illegal campaign contributions. Wilson-Foley received a five-month prison term, while Foley was sentenced to three months in a halfway house. ",politicsNews,"March 18, 2016 ",1
Senators say they might confirm Obama's high court pick after election,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican senators on Thursday raised the possibility they would confirm Barack Obamas Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland before the U.S. president leaves office in January if Democrats retain the White House in the Nov. 8 election. Garland began the customary meetings with senators that kick off the confirmation process. He visited the offices of Democrats Harry Reid and Patrick Leahy a day after Obama nominated the appeals court judge and former prosecutor to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13. Republicans are concerned that if Hillary Clinton, Obamas former secretary of state and the Democratic front-runner, wins the presidential election, she could send the Senate a far more liberal nominee after taking office. Garland, 63, is widely viewed as a moderate acceptable to many Republicans, who also worry they could lose control of the Senate to the Democrats in the November vote. Nominations to the lifetime Supreme Court post require Senate confirmation. Republicans have said they want the next president to make the selection, hoping their party wins Novembers election. Billionaire businessman Donald Trump is the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination. Utahs Orrin Hatch and Arizonas Jeff Flake, Republican members of the Judiciary Committee that would hold any confirmation hearings, said it was possible the Senate could act on Garlands nomination in a lame-duck session after the election and before a new president and Congress take office in January. I would choose a less liberal nominee. And this nominee is a less liberal nominee than we would get, Im quite certain, with Hillary Clinton, Flake told reporters. Senate Republican leaders have vowed not to hold confirmation hearings or an up-or-down vote on any Supreme Court nominee put forward by Obama. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky reiterated that stance on Thursday. Denis McDonough, Obamas chief of staff, said the White House will watch developments over the next several weeks and months but expected Republicans eventually would hold a vote on Garlands nomination. Any Democratic appointee to the high court, now with four liberals and four conservatives following Scalias death, could tip it to the left for the first time in decades. That could shape rulings on such issues as abortion, gun rights, religious rights, affirmative action, union powers and political spending.  Flake said while Republican leaders were fully justified in delaying action on confirmation, if the Republicans lose the White House race the Senate ought to look at this nomination in a lame-duck session in November. Hatch in 1997 backed Garlands nomination to his current judgeship. To this day, I think well of Merrick Garland, and I think hes a fine person, Hatch told National Public Radio. I remain convinced that the best way for the Senate to do its job is to conduct the confirmation process after this toxic presidential election season is over. While McConnell is refusing even to meet with Garland, Republican Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa indicated he was willing. If I can meet with a dictator in Uganda, I can surely meet with a decent person in America, Grassley said, according to CNN. Garland met with Nevadas Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, and Vermonts Leahy, top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. Garland did not address reporters, but Leahy expressed hope that Republican leaders would change course.  If they followed a normal routine, senators could hold  confirmation hearings and a vote by the Memorial Day holiday in late May, Leahy said. Reid pledged to keep up the pressure on Republicans to confirm Garland. Do it now. Why wait? Reid said when asked about a lame-duck confirmation scenario. To hold up a nomination so that Donald Trump can give a nomination? That should scare everybody. ",politicsNews,"March 17, 2016 ",1
U.S. general Lori Robinson to become first woman to lead combatant command,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will name the first woman to head a U.S. combatant command, selecting Air Force General Lori Robinson as the next head of the militarys Northern Command, Defense Secretary Ash Carter said on Friday. The position, which is subject to Senate confirmation, is one of the most senior in the U.S. military and would make Robinson - who now leads U.S. air forces in the Pacific - the top general overseeing activities in North America. General Robinson, it just so happens, would also be the first ever female combatant commander, Carter said, disclosing Obamas plans to nominate her. That shows yet another thing - which is that we have, coming along now, a lot of female officers who are exceptionally strong. And Lori certainly fits into that category, Carter said at an event hosted by Politico. Carter also announced Army General Vincent Brooks, the commanding general of U.S. Army Pacific, would be nominated to become the next commander of U.S. Forces in South Korea.

Presidential candidate Cruz appoints Islam critics as advisers,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ted Cruz, Donald Trumps closest rival in the Republican race for the White House, named his national security advisers on Thursday, including former staffers of President Ronald Reagan and members of a think tank that has been called an anti-Muslim hate group by a civil rights organization. Announcing the team in a statement, Cruz said he would reverse what he described as the weakening of the United States in a dangerous world, singling out militant Islamist groups in the Middle East and North Africa as his focus. Among the most recognizable names on the senators list of 23 advisers was Elliott Abrams, who served in the administrations of both Reagan and President George W. Bush and is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.  But the list of advisers drew more attention for its inclusion of several critics of Muslims. Among those were Frank Gaffney, a former official in the Reagan administration, and at least two other members of a think tank Gaffney founded, the Center for Security Policy. The centers reports argue that hundreds of thousands of American Muslims support Islamist violence in the United States and that there is a conspiracy to erode the U.S. legal system by elevating sharia, the Islamic legal code. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization that monitors U.S. extremist groups, has labeled the Center for Security Policy a hate group and Gaffney a notorious Islamophobe. Gaffney did not respond to a request for comment, but a spokesman pointed to online essays where Gaffney has rejected such criticism, saying his group is a defender of civil liberties against Islamic supremacists. Do you mention any of the other 22 members of the advisory coalition? Brian Phillips, a Cruz spokesman, said in an email, declining to respond to questions about the criticisms made against Gaffney and his think tank. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Muslim rights group, urged Cruz, a Christian, to reconsider having Gaffney and others who have made anti-Muslim remarks as his advisers, saying it suggested the candidate entertained anti-Muslim bigotry. Besides Gaffney and his think-tank colleagues, CAIR said Cruz should drop William Boykin, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general who has said the government should be allowed to ignore the U.S. Constitution to pass laws limiting Muslims right to freedom of speech and religion. Some of Cruzs other advisers have been critical of anti-Islamic rhetoric, including Abrams and Mary Habeck, another former Bush adviser; both have said Islam should not be demonized. Another adviser is Katherine Gorka, president of the Council on Global Security, a group that produces research on Islamist violence, who said in an email that Cruz understands the vital role that Americas military strength plays across the globe but without wanting to engage the U.S. in expensive democracy-building adventures. TRUMP-CRUZ SHOWDOWN Trump, a 69-year-old billionaire businessman from New York, has surged to the front of the once-crowded Republican field, drawing support from voters by proposing to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States for fear they might secretly be members of violent Islamist groups. Trump cited research by Gaffneys group in announcing the plan last year. Cruz, a 45-year-old Texan, is seeking to keep Trump from winning an outright majority of delegates as states vote for party nominees in the coming months, and to wrest the nomination from him at the partys national convention in Cleveland in July.  Conservatives who think Trump strays too far from Republican ideology continued to plot openly to thwart him at or before the convention.  Erick Erickson, a conservative blogger, said in a statement that he joined a meeting of grassroots conservative activists from around the country in Washington on Thursday. He said they made plans to appoint an as-yet-unnamed candidate at what they hope will be the first contested Republican convention since 1948, where a complicated system of ballot rules would come into effect. Earlier this month, Mitt Romney, the partys unsuccessful 2012 presidential candidate, called on Republicans to use tactical voting to slow Trump. The call appeared to have been ignored by many Republican voters, with Trump remaining the leading candidate following the most recent round of primary elections on Tuesday. Cruz has said everyone understands the proposed Muslim ban by Trump, also a Christian, but the senator does not support it, saying there are millions of Muslims who are not murderous. Instead, Cruz supports stopping refugees from some predominantly Muslim countries from coming to the United States. Democratic politicians and others have condemned Republican candidates remarks on Islam, saying they foster further division and discrimination. ",politicsNews,"March 17, 2016 ",1
Hillary Clinton wins Missouri Democratic primary: Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has won the Missouri primary, the Associated Press reported on Thursday, with rival Bernie Sanders conceding the contest. Results for the contest, which was held on Tuesday, were slow to roll in because of the razor-thin margin separating the number of votes received by Clinton and Sanders. Ultimately, Clintons win was declared by just 1,531 votes.  The Sanders campaign had previously weighed the option to request a recount in the tight race, but in an interview with the AP, Sanders said he would prefer to save the taxpayers of Missouri some money, as the winner is awarded just two additional delegates of the otherwise nearly evenly split spread.

Protests planned for Trump speech at pro-Israel conference,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some rabbis and Jewish students are planning protests against Donald Trumps speech on Monday at a conference of the pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC over what they say are his belittling comments about Muslims and other groups. About 18,000 people are expected to attend the American Israel Public Affairs Committees three-day annual conference in Washington. It is not clear how many will either boycott or walk out of the Republican presidential front-runners address.  He has taken every opportunity to vilify women, Muslims, Mexicans, immigrants and the disabled, said Jeffrey Salkin, a rabbi in Hollywood, Florida, who asked rabbis across the country to join him in a boycott. He said 40 had agreed and signed a protest letter he hoped to distribute at the conference. Another group of rabbis and students called Come Together Against Hate is planning to walk out of the room after Trump takes the stage. Jesse Olitzky, one of its organizers, said he did not know how many people would participate. The groups Facebook page had 300 members. Some of the students received an email earlier this week from AIPAC warning that if they disrupted the speech, they would have their conference access revoked. An AIPAC official said on Thursday the message went out in error and was not authorized. I know nothing about that, Trump said in a Reuters interview on Thursday when asked if he had heard about the planned protests and whether he intended to respond. When he announced his candidacy last summer, Trump said some people crossing the U.S. border from Mexico were criminals and rapists, and promised to build a wall along the border. In December, he called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, on national security grounds. Last week, he told CNN: Islam hates us. The Anti-Defamation League and an organization of Reform rabbis condemned his comments.  AIPAC, which is non-partisan, routinely hosts presidential hopefuls at its conference. Trumps remaining Republican rivals, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich, will address the group as well.  The job of AIPAC is not to decide whose policies we like or look into the souls of people, said Seth Siegel, an AIPAC veteran who said he was not speaking on behalf of the organization. Its the organizations job to try to educate elected officials about how to deepen the U.S.-Israel relationship for the benefit of both parties, he said. Having Trump speak at the policy conference is unambiguously part of that mission. ",politicsNews,"March 17, 2016 ",1
Sarah Palin says husband still in intensive care after accident,"(Reuters) - Former U.S. vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin said on Thursday that her husband, who was seriously injured in a snowmobile accident, was still in a hospital intensive care unit after surgery.

Docs essentially lifted and secured every rib with steel bands, anchored the broken clavicle with plates and rods, set aside repair of a broken shoulder for later, she said. Todd Palin was in the accident earlier this week, prompting his wife to cut short a campaign trip for Donald Trump, the front-runner in the race for the Republican Partys presidential nomination.Palin was Republican Senator John McCains running mate in the 2008 presidential election won by Democrat Barack Obama.

House Speaker Ryan says contested Republican convention more likely,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday it is increasingly likely that the Republican Partys presidential nominating convention will be a contested one this summer. If no candidate can assemble 1,237 Republican delegates by July, the partys presidential nominee for the November  election will be chosen by convention delegates in Cleveland, Ohio, in what could be four days of political drama, carried live on national television. Republican front-runner Donald Trump warned on Wednesday of riots if he is denied the partys presidential nomination, after he scored big wins in primaries in Florida, Illinois and North Carolina on Tuesday. It is uncertain whether Trump can get the 1,237 convention delegates he needs before July.  Ryan denounced Trumps riots comment, saying it was unacceptable to even hint at violence. He said he had to study up on the convention process, since he would be chairing the event and wanted to be sure the rule of law prevails.  Nothing has changed other than the perception that this is more likely to become an open convention than we thought before.     So, were getting our minds around the idea that this could very well become a reality, Ryan said. As chairman, Ryan will be charged with opening and closing the event, and overseeing the presidential nomination roll call - possibly more than one, if the first is not decisive. He would also be expected to deal with any floor fights on controversial motions that arise. I will have to obviously bone up on all the rules and all of those things, Ryan told reporters. My goal is ... to be neutral and dispassionate, and to make sure that the rule of law prevails, and to make sure that the delegates make their decision however the rules require them to do that, he said. The last time delegates arrived at a Republican convention without a clear nominee, in Kansas City in 1976, then-President Gerald Ford edged out challenger Ronald Reagan on the first ballot. The last time it took multiple ballots to get a Republican nominee was in 1948, when Thomas Dewey was nominated.  Ryan has been touted as a possible dark-horse candidate for president this year, but the speaker repeated Thursday that he is not running. He said he told former House Speaker John Boehner, who had suggested Ryan be a candidate in case of a deadlocked convention, to knock it off. ",politicsNews,"March 17, 2016 ",1
Republican candidate Cruz wins support from ex-rival Graham,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Republican presidential candidate Senator Lindsey Graham threw his support behind Senator Ted Cruz in the race for his partys presidential nomination on Thursday, saying he thought Cruz has the best chance of stopping front-runner Donald Trump. Graham said he will headline a fundraiser in support of the Texas senator on Monday, in connection with the upcoming conference of the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC. Cruz is to address the AIPAC meeting on Monday. If we give the banner of the Republican party to Donald Trump, we tarnish it maybe forever. That might be the end of the Republican party as I know it, Graham told reporters at the U.S. Capitol. Graham, a U.S. senator from South Carolina who dropped out of the presidential race in December, before the nominating contests had even begun, acknowledged his former harsh criticism of Cruz, including joking about Cruz being murdered on the Senate floor. Its an odd alliance, but its an alliance I feel comfortable with given my choices, Graham said. He said he thought Ohio Governor John Kasich would have a better chance of winning in November, but had concluded that Cruz has a better chance of stopping Trump. I like John Kasich. I think we could nominate John and John would win the general election going away, Graham said. ",politicsNews,"March 17, 2016 ",1
Republican Marco Rubio not making a play for 2016 vice presidency,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio said on Thursday he would not be anybodys running-mate in the Nov. 8 presidential election, slamming down rumors that he was seeking the vice presidential nod from former rivals.  No, Im not going to be anybodys vice president... Im not interested in being vice president, Rubio told reporters on Capitol Hill.  Rubio also ruled out both seeking re-election to the U.S. Senate and a run for the Florida governorship, which was speculated as a potential next step for the first-term U.S. senator from Florida. Im going to finish out my term in the Senate over the next 10 months... and then Ill be a private citizen in January, he said.  Throughout his 2016 bid for the White House, Rubio repeatedly stated he was uninterested in returning to the Senate, instead focusing his campaign efforts solely on the Republican Partys nomination.  Asked whether he would rule out a run for a political office in the future, Rubio said: Im not running for governor, Im not running for re-election to the Senate. Beyond that, who knows? Rubio, once seen as the establishment favorite for the partys nomination, suspended his campaign efforts on Tuesday following a loss in his home-state of Florida to party front-runner and political upstart Donald Trump.

Judiciary committee chair prepared to meet court nominee: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassleys staff has indicated the senator is willing to meet with Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland after a two-week Senate recess, the White House said on Thursday. That obviously is something that we believe is entirely appropriate, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. It certainly is the most basic expectation that people would have for a Senate Judiciary chairman when a consensus Supreme Court nominee has been put forward. President Barack Obama nominated the centrist judge on Wednesday to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13. Garland began meeting with senators on Thursday. Earnest said he hopes that, despite political differences, Grassley will work with the White House to schedule a meeting. ",politicsNews,"March 17, 2016 ",1
Five North Carolina Sheriff's deputies disciplined over Trump rally,"(Reuters) - Five North Carolina Sheriffs deputies have been disciplined over their behavior at a rally for Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump where a white supporter sucker punched a black protester, officials said on Wednesday. The Cumberland County Sheriffs Office said three deputies were demoted and suspended for five days each without pay for their unsatisfactory performance at last weeks rally while the two others were suspended for three days. The actions of the deputies and their failures to act in situations such as that which occurred during the Trump rally at the Crown Coliseum have never been and will not ever be tolerated under the policies of this office, Sheriff Earl Moose Butler said. Following the rally in Fayetteville, John McGraw, a 78-year-old white Trump supporter, was arrested on a misdemeanor assault charge after he was seen on video punching a 26-year-old black protester in the face. Video of the incident recorded by bystanders showed deputies pinning the assaulted protester to the ground, prompting social media criticism on why swift action was taken against him instead of his assailant. All five of the deputies were admonished for their behavior and have been placed on probationary status for the next 12 months, the Sheriffs Office statement said. Sheriffs officials on Monday decided against criminally charging Trump or his campaign with inciting a riot at the rally. Trump has rejected suggestions that his language was to blame for recent clashes at his rallies. The 69-year-old New Yorker leads a field of three Republican candidates vying for the partys presidential nomination. (This version of the story corrects paragraph four to show that the Trump supporter was arrested the after rally.) ",politicsNews,"March 16, 2016 ",1
Embraer consultant says believes CEO knew of bribery: WSJ,"(Reuters) - A sales consultant told Brazilian prosecutors he believes planemaker Embraer SAs top officials, including Chief Executive Frederico Curado, knew of illicit payments related to the sale of military aircraft to the Dominican Republic, the Wall Street Journal reported. Embraer is under investigation by the U.S. and Brazilian authorities for allegedly bribing officials in the Dominican Republic to secure deals for commercial and defense aircraft. According to official summaries of sales consultant Elio Moti Sonnenfelds statements, he received a payment of $3.4 million from Embraer for work he did not perform, and which he passed along as a bribe to a public official in the Dominican Republic, the newspaper reported on Wednesday.  The Journal, citing a person close to the case, reported on Thursday that a Brazilian judge had dismissed criminal charges against Sonnenfeld in February.  The alleged bribery helped Embraer secure a $92 million contract in 2008 to sell eight turboprop attack support aircraft to the Carribean country. An Embraer official, declining to comment directly on Sonnenfelds reported statements, said Wednesdays Journal story was based on allegations that were apparently leaked from confidential testimony in a legal case in Brazil, the details of which were not available to the company. The official noted that Embraer had stated publicly that it was conducting an internal investigation and cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in relation to possible violations of the U.S.Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Prosecutors in Brazil filed a criminal complaint in 2014 against Sonnenfeld and eight former Embraer vice presidents, directors and managers, charging them with corruption and money laundering. CEO Curado has not been named as a defendant and has not been accused of any wrongdoing. ",politicsNews,"March 17, 2016 ",1
"Top U.S. general, without citing Trump, warns on troops' morale","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. military officer told the Senate on Thursday that it would harm the morale of U.S. forces to order them to carry out activities such as waterboarding or targeting civilians, options previously cited by leading Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, did not comment on U.S. politics, and Trumps name did not come up in a question put to him by Senator Lindsey Graham or in Dunfords response. However, when asked by Graham, a former 2016 White House contender and frequent Trump critic, what the impact such tactics would have on the morale of the force, Dunford said: Those kinds of activities that you described are inconsistent with the values of our nation. And quite frankly I think it would have an adverse effect, citing fallout on the morale of the force. And frankly what you are suggesting are things that actually arent legal for them to do anyway, Dunford added.  During the campaign, Trump indicated that, if elected president, he might order the U.S. military to break the law on interrogation tactics, including waterboarding. Trump also suggested his willingness to target the families of terrorist suspects. Trump, the Republican front-runner, softened his stance on torture earlier in March, saying he would not order the U.S. military to break international laws on how to treat terrorism suspects. Waterboarding is the practice of pouring water over someones face to mimic drowning as an interrogation tactic. Critics say it is torture. Democratic President Barack Obama banned use of the method days after taking office in 2009. ",politicsNews,"March 17, 2016 ",1
Kremlin says Donald Trump pre-election clip demonizes Russia,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin on Thursday condemned a pre-election video in the United States promoting Republican front-runner Donald Trump at Hillary Clintons expense, complaining that it unfairly demonized Russia. The Kremlin did not spell out what its exact objection to the political attack video was. But its portrayal of President Vladimir Putin as one of Washingtons toughest opponents alongside Islamic State, a group the Kremlin says it is fighting in Syria, is likely to have stirred anger among officials.   I saw this clip. I do not know for sure if Vladimir Putin saw it. (But) our attitude is negative, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a teleconference with reporters. The video tries to cast doubt over the ability of Clinton, the Democratic Partys likely presidential candidate, to contend with Putin in the event of her winning the November election. Presenting what it suggests are the United States toughest opponents, it shows Putin throwing an opponent in a judo bout before cutting to footage of Mohammed Emwazi, the late Islamic State executioner nicknamed Jihadi John.    It then shifts to a clip of Clinton which has been edited to make it appear as if she is barking like a dog. Putin is then shown laughing. Its an open secret for us that demonizing Russia and whatever is linked to Russia is unfortunately a mandatory hallmark of Americas election campaign, said Peskov. We always sincerely regret this and wish the (U.S.) electoral process were conducted without such references to our country. Until now, the Kremlin has largely held off criticising Trump. Putin and Trump have lavished praise on one another in the past after the Republican front-runner spoke out in favour of building bridges with the Kremlin and of working together to fight terrorism. Russian state TV, which usually closely reflects the Kremlins world view, has also generally been more positive about Trump than the other presidential candidates, suggesting his policies are more Russia-friendly. But state TV has at the same time complained about what it says is the anti-Russian tenor of the overall campaign, criticising most candidates for what it has described as their hysterical Cold War-style statements on Russia. The United States has accused Russia during its aerial bombing campaign in Syria of not targeting Islamic State targets with the same ferocity or frequency it has demonstrated against what Washington says are more moderate groups opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.   Moscow, an ally of Assad, has denied that charge, declaring Islamic State a dangerous threat to its own national security.  ",politicsNews,"March 17, 2016 ",1
Republican Ryan rejects Trump warning of riots in presidential race,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan on Thursday rejected a warning by Donald Trump of riots if the businessman does not win the Republican presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election. Asked about Republican front-runner Trumps warning, Ryan told reporters that nobody should say such things. He added: To even address or hint to violence is unacceptable. Ryan, who will oversee Republicans convention in July to pick the partys presidential candidate, said he does not think he will have to denounce Trump as a candidate.

Sergeant Bergdahl says 'fantastic' plan crumbled hours after leaving post,"(Reuters) - U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl had devised what he told a military investigator was a fantastic plan to leave his post so he could inform higher-ups about problems in the ranks, but that fell apart when he realized he took on more than he could manage. Bergdahl, 29, who walked away from his post in Afghanistan in 2009 and became a Taliban prisoner for five years, is facing a court-martial with a potential life sentence on charges of desertion and endangerment of U.S. troops. In a 371-page interview made public on Wednesday, Bergdahl said he was frustrated and concerned about the command at his post in Afghanistan, seeing it as incompetent, immoral and putting soldiers lives in danger. He devised a scheme to leave and travel by foot to a military command about 20 miles away, with his disappearance causing a full-scale search. When he arrived, he thought this would get him an audience with a general to air his grievances. I came up with a fantastic plan, he told the military investigator in 2014 about three months after his release. I was seeing things heading in a very dangerous direction. So, I had to do something.  He left at night and was captured the next day by the Taliban.   By daylight, I will admit I was in over my head, he said in the transcript released by Bergdahls lawyer Eugene Fidell, of an interview with Army investigator, Major General Kenneth Dahl, in 2014. At the end of the interview, Dahl mentioned desertion, AWOL and fraudulent enlistment offenses to Bergdahl but made no mention of the more serious charge of endangering U.S. troops, which carries up to a life sentence, according to the transcript.  At an evidentiary hearing in Texas in September 2015, Dahl said he did not believe Bergdahl should be jailed for what he did. He said Bergdahl was not a Taliban sympathizer and characterized him as an unrealistically idealistic soldier.  Dahl also said no soldiers directly involved in the search for him were killed. U.S. military prosecutors have said Bergdahl sneaked off his  post, resulting in a 45-day search that put soldiers lives at risk and diverted attention from the fight against the Taliban. Bergdahl was freed in a prisoner swap in May 2014 involving the release of five Taliban leaders held by the United States. The deal drew heavy criticism from Republicans.

Senator McCain wants Pentagon to probe United Launch executive's remarks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain on Thursday urged Defense Secretary Ash Carter to investigate what he called troubling remarks by a former senior United Launch Alliance executive about his companys dealings with the Pentagon. Brett Tobey resigned Wednesday as vice president of engineering for ULA, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co, after his comments at a Colorado university were posted by Space News, a trade publication. In his remarks, Tobey contradicted ULAs reason for skipping a competition to launch GPS satellites and said the Defense Department bent over backwards to lean the field to ULAs advantage in that competition with new market entrant SpaceX. He also said the Pentagon was trying to figure out how do we silence McCain, who has urged the government to penalize ULA for failing to bid in the competition despite receiving $800 million in support funding for launch services every year. This committee treats with the utmost seriousness any implication that the Department showed favoritism to a major defense contractor or that efforts have been made to silence members of Congress, McCain told Carter at a hearing on the U.S. Defense Departments fiscal 2017 budget request. ULA said Tobeys remarks were inaccurate. ULA, the sole provider for U.S. military launches for nearly a decade, is scrambling to restructure so it can compete with Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX. ULA last year said it had skipped the GPS-3 launch competition because it lacked the required accounting systems and did not have enough Russian-built RD-180 engines to power its Atlas 5 rockets due to a ban imposed by Congress after Russias annexation of the Ukraine region of Crimea. Tobey said ULA did not want to get into a price shootout with SpaceX since its launches cost $125 million, or close to $200 million including the separate launch support contract, compared to around $60 million for SpaceX. Carter did not respond to McCains request for a full investigation into the comments from the former ULA executive. Winston Beauchamp, deputy undersecretary of the Air Force for space, had no immediate comment on Tobeys remarks. He said the Air Force had concluded it could not penalize ULA for not bidding in the GPS-3 launch competition since there was no requirements for companies to bid. He also noted that the launch support contract was solely associated with launches already awarded to ULA under an earlier block buy contract. ",politicsNews,"March 17, 2016 ",1

Religious liberty bill passes Georgia state legislature," (In March 16 item, corrects timing of legislative session in final paragraph) By Rich McKay ATLANTA (Reuters) - A religious freedom bill described by opponents as being discriminatory against same-sex couples passed the Georgia state legislature on Wednesday night in an 11th-hour vote ahead of the sessions close.  The legislation, dubbed the Religious Liberty Bill, still has to be signed by Georgias Republican Governor Nathan Deal to become law. Deal has made clear that he will not sign a bill that allows discrimination, but his office did not immediately respond to request for comment on Wednesday night. Similar bills in states like Indiana and Arkansas sparked storms of criticism last year, forcing many lawmakers to retreat from the provisions. The Georgia bill, reworked several times by lawmakers amid criticism that earlier versions went too far, declares that no pastor can be forced to perform a same-sex wedding.  The bill also grants faith-based organizations  churches, religious schools or associations - the right to reject holding events for people or groups of whom they object. Faith-based groups also could not be forced to hire or retain an employee whose beliefs run counter to the organizations. Opponents say the bill could be used to deny services and discriminate against same-sex couples. The decision by the legislature today was to make an egregious and discriminatory bill even worse, the Human Rights Campaign, which represents thelesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community, said in a statement.  Its appalling that anti-equality extremists in the legislature are trying to ignore the will of the people of Georgia, it said. Mike Griffin, a lobbyist and spokesman for the Georgia Baptist Convention, applauded the bills passage. He said that while the bill did not give them everything they wanted, he added: We feel weve advanced our protection of our First Amendment Right to religious freedom. Our rights of religious liberty dont end inside the four walls of a church, he said. In a late added amendment, the proposed law says that it cannot allow discrimination already prohibited by federal law, which opponents said could nullify some of its provisions. More than 300 large corporations and small businesses, including Delta Airlines and Coca Cola, have signed a pledge decrying the Georgia legislation and urging the state lawmakers to drop it. The state legislature is set to wrap up its current legislative session next week. ",politicsNews,"March 17, 2016 ",1
Obama picks centrist high court nominee; Republicans unmoved,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama selected Merrick Garland for the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday, choosing a centrist judge meant to win over recalcitrant Senate Republicans whose leaders wasted no time in spurning the Democratic president. A bruising political fight is brewing over the nomination, which also promises to figure in the already contentious campaign for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. The Republican-led Senates leaders have vowed not to hold confirmation hearings or an up-or-down vote on any Obama nominee. Garland, 63, was picked to replace long-serving conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13. A Chicagoan like Obama, he serves as chief judge of the influential U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and is a former prosecutor who in the past has won praise from both Republicans and Democrats. Wasting no time in pressing its case for Senate confirmation, the administration is dispatching Garland to Capitol Hill on Thursday to huddle with Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the senior Judiciary Committee Democrat and then with Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada. Such meetings are aimed at shoring up Senate support for the nominee and generating media coverage. The lifetime appointment to the high court requires Senate confirmation. Obamas announcement prompted a flood of reaction from private groups that will work to advance or kill the nomination. The UAW, representing automobile, aerospace and some agricultural workers, call Garland a distinguished, moderate judge with more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history. National Rifle Association Executive Director Chris Cox said, A basic analysis of Merrick Garlands judicial record shows that he does not respect our fundamental, individual right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.   Republicans, hoping a candidate from their party wins the presidential election, are demanding that Obama leave the seat vacant and let his successor, to be sworn in next January, make the selection. Billionaire businessman Donald Trump is leading among Republicans for the nomination. Obamas former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, is the front-runner for the Democrats. Obama said Republican senators should give Garland a fair hearing. He said that failing to do so will not only be an abdication of the Senates constitutional duty, it will indicate a process for nominating and confirming judges that is beyond repair. Such a move, he said, would also undermine the reputation of the Supreme Court and faith in the American justice system. Our democracy will ultimately suffer as well, Obama added, as he introduced Garland at a White House Rose Garden ceremony. Scalias death left the nine-member Supreme Court evenly split with four liberals and four conservative justices. Obamas nominee could tilt the court to the left for the first time in decades, which could affect rulings on contentious issues including abortion, gun rights, the death penalty and political spending. Obama said the Supreme Court was supposed to be above politics and it should remain so. Obama said that with politics in the United States so polarized, this is precisely the time when we should play it straight, and treat the process of appointing a Supreme Court justice with the seriousness and care it deserves. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky swiftly reiterated that the Senate will not consider the nomination by the president. A McConnell spokesman said the senator had spoken by phone with Garland and would not hold a perfunctory meeting with him.  John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican, added, This person will not be confirmed, so theres no reason going through some motions and pretending like it will happen, because its not going to happen. Some cracks began appearing in McConnells strategy of completely shutting out the nominee. A handful of Republican senators including Susan Collins of Maine, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Rob Portman of Ohio said they would be willing to meet with Garland. Collins said the Senate Judiciary Committee should hold confirmation hearings. Judiciary Committee member Orrin Hatch, whose past support of Garland was cited by Obama, said the pick does not change his view at this point that no Obama nominee should be considered.  Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, who is in a tough re-election battle, said, Should Merrick Garland be nominated again by the next president, I would be happy to carefully consider his nomination. Garland is the oldest Supreme Court nominee since Republican Richard Nixon in 1971 nominated Lewis Powell, who was 64. Presidents tend to pick nominees younger than that so they can serve for decades and extend a presidents legacy. Obama may reason that the choice of an older nominee might also entice Senate Republicans into considering his selection. Garland would become the fourth Jewish member of the nine-member court. There are five Roman Catholics on the court. Obama considered but passed over Garland when he made two prior Supreme Court appointments.  With solid Republican support, the Senate voted in 1997 to confirm Garland to his present job in a bipartisan 76-23 vote after he was nominated by Democratic President Bill Clinton. Garland is widely viewed as a moderate. He is a former prosecutor who served in the Justice Department under Clinton. He oversaw the prosecution in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing case including securing the death penalty for the lead defendant, anti-government militant Timothy McVeigh. In his current post, he is known for narrow, centrist opinions and rhetoric that is measured rather than inflammatory even when in dissent. Standing in between Obama and Vice President Joe Biden during the Rose Garden ceremony, an emotional Garland referred to the Oklahoma City bombing case, saying, Once again, I saw the importance of assuring victims and families that the justice system could work. Obama said he fulfilled his constitutional duty by naming a nominee and said it was time for the Senate to do its job.  Presidents do not stop working in the final year of their term. Neither should a senator, Obama said. Obama, in office since 2009, has already named two justices to the Supreme Court: Sonia Sotomayor, who at 55 became the first Hispanic justice in 2009, and Elena Kagan, who was 50 when she became the fourth woman ever to serve on the court in 2010. Democrats praised his latest choice. If Merrick Garland cant get bipartisan support no one can, Democratic Senator Charles Schumer of New York said. Hillary Clinton called Garland a brilliant legal mind, urging the Senate to move ahead with the confirmation process. Trump said it was critical for Republicans to take back the White House to avoid Democrats shaping the Supreme Court for decades to come. ",politicsNews,"March 16, 2016 ",1
"As appellate judge, Garland viewed as friend of government regulators","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland has been sympathetic to government regulators in his almost two decades as an appeals court judge, frequently rejecting business-led challenges to federal action. His overall record, however, suggests he is a moderate who follows Supreme Court precedent and is not eager to spearhead efforts to adopt novel legal theories. Garland sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which hears a large proportion of the legal challenges to major federal regulations in areas such as environment and labor. They are often brought by business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Cases are assigned randomly to three-judge panels. Garland has avoided some of the most contentious cases of recent years, including challenges to government efforts under President Barack Obama to curb carbon emissions and ensure equal access to Internet data via its so called net neutrality rule. Of the cases in which he has participated, some of his opinions and votes in his 19 years on the bench have already attracted criticism from conservative and pro-business groups following his nomination to the high court by Obama on Wednesday. They say he too easily defers to government action.  We have great concerns about this nominees record, said Juanita Duggan, president of the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents small business owners. The group cites several cases, including one from 2003 in which the appeals court ruled against a developer challenging a finding the federal government had authority to force it to take measures to protect an endangered toad on the property under the federal Endangered Species Act. The ruling, written by Garland, was a win for the administration of Republican President George W. Bush, which was defending the actions of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Garland wrote a narrow decision, saying he was merely staying in line with court precedent. One of the judges on the appeals court who disagreed with the outcome was John Roberts, who Bush appointed as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 2005. Roberts questioned whether the federal government had the authority to issue regulations protecting what he described as a hapless toad. Roberts opinion was questioned by liberals when he was nominated to the high court as a sign that he would limit federal power to issue broad nationwide regulations. In another case mentioned by the business group, Garland was part of a three-judge panel that in 1998 upheld Environmental Protection Agency emissions limits for nitrogen oxides from electric utility boilers. More recently, he was on a panel in 2014 that upheld an Obama administration air pollution rule that limits emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants. The court held that the government was not required to consider the cost of compliance before issuing the regulation. The Supreme Court in June 2015 threw out that decision, although the regulation remains in place. In another 2014 case, he was part of a panel of 11 judges that ruled 8-3 to reject a food industry challenge to a federal rule concerning labeling requirements for meat. Despite those votes in favor of the government and against business interests, Garland is seen by legal experts as a moderate on the appeals court. Hes a modest judge in that he really does try to stick to Supreme Court precedent, said Jonathan Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law. Adler said Garland was somewhere in the middle of the 17-judge court when it comes to deference to agency action. Appeals court judges hands are somewhat tied on regulatory cases because they are bound by Supreme Court precedent that favors deference to government agencies. In 1984, the high court ruled that judges should not second-guess agencies if the law is ambiguous. Neal Katyal, a former Obama administration lawyer now in private practice with the Hogan Lovells law firm, said it is a really tough argument to suggest Garlands rulings on regulations show an ideological leaning. He described Garlands record on such cases as very, very centrist. The Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, another industry group that regularly fights government regulations, said they would not comment on the merits of Garlands nomination. (This version of the story corrects the day of nomination announcement to Wednesday in paragraph five.) ",politicsNews,"March 16, 2016 ",1
Obama administration offers $66 million to aid coal communities,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration released $65.8 million on Thursday to help communities that are struggling from the decline of the coal industry and bankruptcies of major producers of the fuel. The funds announced by the federal Appalachian Regional Commission and the Economic Development Administration will support projects that help coal-dependent communities in places like West Virginia and Kentucky diversify their economies, retrain the workforce and attract new investment. The funds are coming through the Obama administrations Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization Initiative, which helps coal-reliant regions cope with market forces, air pollution regulations and other factors.   Many communities across Appalachia  from coal mines to Main Streets  are being impacted as the world changes the way it produces and consumes electricity, said ARC Chairman Earl Gohl. The grant comes the day after Peabody Energy Corp, the largest U.S. coal producer, said it might have to seek bankruptcy protection. Peabody would become the latest in a line of major coal miners, including Arch Coal Inc, to file for bankruptcy as demand for coal plummets both domestically and in global markets like China and amid competition from natural gas.  The plight of coal communities, particularly in the Appalachian region of the eastern United States, has gained importance in the 2016 presidential campaign, where economic frustration of white working-class voters has become a major theme.  Last week, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton triggered critical comments from Republican lawmakers in Kentucky when she told a CNN town hall meeting: Were going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business when explaining her $30 billion economic transition plan for coal-dependent regions. Her plan expands on Obamas broader POWER+ Plan, a set of investments in coal-dependent communities outlined in his 2017 budget.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, a Republican, called Clintons comments callous and said it underlines the need to stand up for hard-working, middle-class coal families. Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said McConnell and other critics twisted Clintons words to suggest she showed a disregard for coal workers and their livelihoods. Meanwhile, New York real estate mogul Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, said at a recent campaign stop in Ohio: We have to protect your coal industry which is being decimated by the Obama administrations environmental regulations.

"Cuba changing, but only slowly, since Obama's policy shift","HAVANA (Reuters) - Saul Berenthal has waited for decades for a chance to do business in Cuba. Despite the astonishing breakthroughs in U.S.-Cuban relations under President Barack Obama, he must wait some more. Berenthal and business partner Horace Clemmons of Alabama are close to becoming the first U.S. businessmen to manufacture in Cuba with a plan to build low-cost tractors designed for Cuban farms, largely run by private cooperatives. Their project has U.S. approval and Cubas Communist  government has given positive signals about the proposed plant but has yet to bestow permission. Its a little bit of a test of loyalty. Are we willing to go through obstacles to achieve what we believe is a good thing for the Cubans and ourselves? said Berenthal, who was born in Cuba in 1944 and left for the United States as a student in 1960, a year after Fidel Castros revolution. After more than half a century of antagonism between the two countries, Obama has redefined relations with Cuba in the last 15 months, and Cuba is changing. But its leaders are wary of moving too quickly. What is perceived on the outside as slow progress is really the way of Cubans assuring themselves of the trust that is necessary to be built, Berenthal said. Obama arrives in Havana on Sunday for a historic visit that seals a rapprochement he and Cuban President Raul Castro agreed in December 2014 after 18 months of secret negotiations. Since then, Havana has changed noticeably. The number of U.S. visitors soared 77 percent in 2015, swarming hotels and restaurants that have been booked to capacity.  Obama this week issued sweeping regulations to promote even more U.S. travel and trade to Cuba. It was the fifth time he has used executive powers to boost ties with Cuba, sidestepping the Republican-controlled Congress which has refused to lift a 54-year-old economic embargo against the island. Cubas government has yet to fully reciprocate. Cuba did agree to roaming deals with U.S. telecommunications operators and restoring scheduled commercial airline service, two deals that bring more revenue to the government. When it comes to Obamas overtures to the Cubas small but growing private sector, however, the government has been more deliberate. It has yet to accept U.S. sales of farming equipment and construction materials to private businesses, which were authorized by Obama.  Market-style reforms, introduced by Raul Castro in 2011 to update Cubas socialist model, have been implemented haltingly, even reversed in some areas. The government recently attempted restoring price controls on fresh food markets in Havana. Many traits of communism remain. Political dissent is  repressed, commercial property cannot be bought and sold and the government still controls imports and exports.  There is no wholesale market for most private enterprises, forcing shopkeepers to buy inventory at state retail prices or resort to trickery or the black market.  Cuba has already changed, but needs more, said Niuris Higueras, owner of the Atelier restaurant, one of the trendiest spots in Havanas dining scene. She said business grew 50 percent over the past year. We need to link up with the U.S. market, Higueras said. There needs to be more access to U.S. products here in Cuba. We need Home Depot, a Walmart, a Costco. A Restaurant Depot would be fabulous. While the ice has been broken on commerce, Castro insists there will be no change to one-party rule.    U.S.-backed dissidents are still detained for attempting  unauthorized political demonstrations and opponents of Obamas opening to Cuba say he has rewarded Castro without receiving concessions in return. The White House counters that helping stimulate a vibrant private sector is good for ordinary Cubans and offers a more promising path toward political change than the decades-old policy of isolation. While the date of Dec. 17, 2014, marks the most significant turning point in U.S.-Cuban relations, the Obama policy that has so far had most impact on the lives of ordinary Cubans was implemented in 2009, just three months into his presidency. It was then he ordered the lifting of travel restrictions on Cuban-Americans visiting relatives in Cuba and the removal of limits on remittances to relatives on the island. Cuban-Americans can now come and go freely and send as much money as they want to their families. That has financed a boom in small businesses and home repairs and jolted the nascent real estate market. Castros own reforms have also helped grow the private sector. Today some 500,000 Cubans, or 10 percent of the workforce, are registered to work in private businesses, including restaurants, car repair workshops, homes rented out to tourists, beauty parlors and English language schools. Some 70 percent of the 1-million-strong agricultural workforce is private with many Cubans working on state farms that have converted into cooperatives and owning equal stakes in the business.   John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, which has been tracking Cuba for more than 20 years, says the changes have lifted expectations, especially inside the budding middle-class.  There is now additional pressure from within for structural changes to the ideological foundation of the country. Cuba must do more than reform the commercial and economic sectors of the country. It must aggressively redefine the revolution, Kavulich said. While Cuban dissidents and Obamas critics at home prioritize the issue of human rights, others are more concerned about economic growth and better living conditions. No one is talking about the visit in terms of democracy, human rights or the opposition. There is still no culture around freedom of expression, Anaida Gonzalez, a retired nurse in central Camaguey province, said in a telephone interview. People have too many problems in their daily lives. What they want is for their lives to improve and they associate that with the embargo, she said.    Most Cubans live on state salaries that average $25 a month plus a monthly ration card that provides about a weeks worth of food and household supplies. It would be a mistake to assume most Cubans prioritize political questions and are scared to express themselves, said Carlos Alzugaray, a retired Cuban diplomat and professor specializing in U.S.-Cuban relations. They hope to live better. Change, political and economic, is coming to Cuba anyway, but on our own terms. ",politicsNews,"March 17, 2016 ",1
Half of U.S. women have 'very unfavorable' view of Trump: poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Real estate billionaire Donald Trumps coarse rhetoric has won him some fans, but theres at least one large group in America that is increasingly unimpressed: women. Half of U.S. women say they have a very unfavorable view of the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, up from the 40 percent who felt that way in October. The survey was taken from March 1-15, and included 5,400 respondents.  The rise in anti-Trump sentiment among women could pose a problem for the New York billionaire in his quest for the White House. Women form just over half of the U.S. population, and they have turned out at higher rates than men in every election since 1996, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. If the presidential election were tomorrow, women would be a big problem for Trump, Republican strategist David Carney said. But he has time to fix it. A Trump campaign official did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Trump has said that he has had good relationships with women in his business career and is well-liked by women voters.     Several women who oppose Trump, interviewed by Reuters this week, said their disapproval was based on a range of factors from his disparaging comments about women he dislikes - such as Fox News host Megyn Kelly - to his hard-line views on immigration and his ribald exchanges with rivals. I think Trump is very scary, said Mariah Dobias, a 25-year-old cook who was voting in Ohios primary on Tuesday. He says he is going to make America great, but he doesnt say how he is going to do it besides alienating whole groups of people. Carolyn Hostetler, a conservative from Tennessee, told Reuters she disliked the way he has belittled women. Some of Trumps female supporters, meanwhile, said they liked his straight talk, and believe he could strengthen Americas position on the world stage. Hes a little unpredictable, as weve seen, said Kathleen Douglas, a 65-year-old college professor from Winter Park, Florida who supports Trump. Hes going to put other world leaders on edge.         Trump does not have a similar image problem with men. The Reuters/Ipsos polling results showed that just 36 percent of men said they have a very unfavorable opinion of Trump, a level that has held steady in recent months. Republican women are also much more likely to approve of Trump, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Among women who identify as Republican, he has been holding around 60 percent favorability since the start of the year.      Trumps relative appeal among men versus women was evident in the most recent round of nominating contests on Tuesday, when Trump extended a broad lead over rivals.  In Florida, exit polls conducted by Edison Research showed that Trumps support among Republican women voters was 40 percent, versus 52 percent among males. In Ohio, where Trump came in second to the states governor, John Kasich, 33 percent of women voters backed Trump, compared with 40 percent of men. If the GOP frontrunner were to run against Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton in the general election, likely women voters would support Clinton over Trump by nearly 14 percentage points, according to the March polling data. Among men, Clinton would win by about 5 percentage points. At a precinct in Floridas Winter Park, Darlene Monzadeh, a 52-year-old stay-at-home mom who had been a supporter of Jeb Bush, said Trump lost her vote during a debate when he exchanged potshots with his rivals. It changed my opinion. When they catfight all the time and act like little boys, pointing fingers,raising voices, she said, adding she now supports Kasich.     Trump has been accused by critics of misogyny since he launched his campaign. He complained last year that Fox News host Megyn Kelly had asked him tough questions in a debate and referred to blood coming out of her wherever. He more recently sent a Twitter post suggesting she was a bimbo.  He has called television personality Rosie ODonnell a fat pig and made fun of former presidential rival and ex-HP chief executive Carly Fiorinas face, saying, Would anyone vote for that? An anti-Trump attack ad launched by the Our Principles Super PAC this week featured women repeating words that Trump has used to describe women, including fat pig and dog. Several of his female supporters defended Trump against the ad on social media. ",politicsNews,"March 17, 2016 ",1
Australian minister says Trump phenomenon 'terrifying',"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A senior Australian government minister on Thursday called Donald Trumps campaign for the U.S. presidency terrifying and warned it risked casting the Republican Party into the wilderness if he wins nomination. Australian government ministers rarely make critical comments about elections in other countries, especially stalwart allies like the United States, which Australia relies on heavily for military backing in the Asia-Pacific. Australian Industry Minister Christopher Pyne, a cabinet member of the ruling conservative Liberal-National coalition, criticized the violence at recent Trump rallies and said that his rise was casting a pall over American democracy.  Now, democracy should be robust but it certainly shouldnt be violent, Pyne said in an interview on Australias Channel Seven television network. And I think the Donald Trump phenomenon is a real problem for the United States, making their democracy look kind of weird, he said. Republican front-runner Trump warned on Wednesday of riots if he is denied the partys presidential nomination, only days after Trump supporters and protesters clashed at a rally for the Republican in Chicago that was later scrapped. Republican Party leaders are appalled at Trumps incendiary rhetoric and reject policies such as his vow to deport 11 million illegal immigrants, temporarily ban Muslims from the United States and build a wall along the Mexican border. The party tried to play down Trumps riot comments, which have raised the temperature even more in a heated White House race. ",politicsNews,"March 17, 2016 ",1
"After Trump pulls out, Fox News cancels Republican debate","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Republican presidential debate scheduled for next week in Utah has been canceled, host Fox News said on Wednesday, after party front-runner Donald Trump told the network he would not participate. Trump, who has clashed with Fox News throughout his campaign, told the network in an interview on Wednesday he would not appear at the event, scheduled for Monday, because he thought the Republicans had had enough debates. Ohio Governor John Kasich said afterward he would also skip the debate unless Trump changed his mind and decided to come.  U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the third remaining Republican candidate seeking the partys nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election, criticized Trump on Twitter, calling him #DuckingDonald and urging his supporters to tell Trump to attend. Hes scared to debate, Cruz said in an interview on Fox News. Hes afraid of being challenged. Fox News, part of the Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) broadcast media and entertainment company controlled by Rupert Murdoch, earlier this week announced the debate, to be held in Salt Lake City, its latest in the primary season. Utah holds its presidential primary next Tuesday. Ted Cruz has expressed a willingness to debate Trump or Kasich - or both. But obviously, there needs to be more than one participant, Fox News Channels executive vice president of news, Michael Clemente, said in a statement. So the Salt Lake City debate is canceled. After the cancellation, Trump posted on Twitter that he would make a big speech the night of the debate, but I wish everyone well. The brash New York billionaire skipped a Fox News debate in Iowa in January after complaining he had been mistreated by the network. He has long clashed with anchor Megyn Kelly and revived criticism of her on Tuesday, saying on Twitter she was crazy and unwatchable.  The Iowa debate went on as scheduled, despite Trumps decision to host a rally at the same time. But back in January, the Republican field was much larger, with Trump among eight contenders who qualified to participate in the Iowa debate, and four others qualifying for an earlier undercard debate. Wednesday marked the first time either party has canceled a debate. Trumps participation in the debates has helped networks draw record audiences. Two previous debates this election cycle hosted by Fox News attracted the two largest U.S. audiences for non-sports cable TV programs in history. Some 24 million Americans tuned in for the first Republican presidential debate last August, while another in Detroit earlier this month attracted 16.9 million viewers. In February, CBS (CBS.N) Chief Executive Les Moonves spoke candidly about the advertising money the Republican front-runner was bringing to the network. The moneys rolling in and this is fun, Moonves said at a telecommunications conference in San Francisco, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Ive never seen anything like this, and this is going to be a very good year for us, Moonves said. Sorry. Its a terrible thing to say. But bring it on, Donald. Keep going.

Obama's trip aims to make Cuba opening 'irreversible',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama plans to lay out his vision for U.S.-Cuba relations in a major speech during next weeks historic visit to Havana aimed at making his opening to Americas former Cold War foe irreversible, the White House said on Wednesday. Previewing Obamas three-day trip, U.S. deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes expressed hope that Tuesdays scheduled speech to the Cuban people would be broadcast throughout the island and said Cubas Communist government had not raised any objections to doing so. But Rhodes could not confirm whether the event, which will take place at Havanas legendary Gran Teatro, would actually be carried by Cubas state-run media, saying, Well see how that transpires. Obama, who will be the first U.S. president to visit Cuba in 88 years, arrives on Sunday and holds talks on Monday with Cuban President Raul Castro, followed by what Rhodes described as a joint press event and a state dinner. Obamas meeting with Cuban dissidents on Tuesday will include prominent activists of his own choosing, Rhodes said. Despite Cuban leaders view of such meetings as interference in the islands internal affairs, Rhodes said there was no reason to believe the government would block any invitees from participating. If there are any impediments to that meeting we would be very clear about this, Rhodes said. He declined to name any of those who would attend. Obama will arrive just days after unveiling sweeping new measures to make it far easier for Americans to visit Cuba and for the islands government to conduct international trade. Obamas critics have accused him of giving up too much in return for too little from Cuban leaders and of now taking a premature victory lap. The Obama administration insists that engagement will benefit the Cuban people and open up the island to U.S. business  though Cuban leaders have been slow to make economic reforms. At the same time, the decades-old U.S. trade embargo against Cuba remains, with little chance Congress will lift it anytime soon. Rhodes said Obamas speech will be a very important moment in the presidents trip, an opportunity for him to describe the course that were on, to review the complicated history between our two countries  but also to look forward to the future. We very much want to make the process of normalization irreversible, he told reporters on a conference call. Obamas aides hope that getting more U.S companies invested in Cuba and loosening up travel to the island will make it almost impossible for traditionally pro-business Republicans to roll back the thaw if they win the White House in November. Traveling with first lady Michelle Obama and their daughters Sasha and Malia, the president plans to start his visit late on Sunday with a tour of the cultural sites of Old Havana. He will also meet Cardinal Jaime Ortega, who played a key role in the U.S.-Cuba diplomatic breakthrough in December 2014, at Havanas cathedral, Rhodes said. ",politicsNews,"March 16, 2016 ",1
"Attack ads, protests and phone calls: selling the Supreme Court nominee","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As President Barack Obama unveiled his Supreme Court nominee on Wednesday, a carefully crafted operation to sell his choice to Americans and to resistant Republicans rolled into action. Liberal groups announced a national campaign to target Republican Senate opponents with demonstrations and television ads in what is likely to be one of the most bitter fights ever over a Supreme Court nomination.  The White House has enlisted legal scholars and corporate executives to make the case for centrist judge Merrick Garland despite resistance from Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and other senior Republicans who have said Obama should let the next president fill the position. Garland himself, an appeals-court judge, immediately started making calls to Capitol Hill, signaling the start of a battle for public perceptions as Obama seeks to highlight what Democrats characterize as unprecedented obstructionism. The pressure may not be enough to convince Republicans to give Garland a hearing, let alone a confirmation vote.  But the White House is betting that since many Republicans face tough re-election battles, they may be less willing to reject Garland out of hand.  The White House has enlisted former White House officials Stephanie Cutter and Katie Beirne Fallon to mobilize liberal groups, which see the fight as a historic chance to push the Supreme Court to the left as well as mobilize their supporters ahead of the elections. Were going to organize in record numbers, said Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, which plans rallies outside the offices of Republican senators in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin and New Hampshire starting next week. Republicans likely wont be swayed by such messages, but voters may be, said Michael Gottlieb, a lawyer at Washington firm Boies, Schiller, & Flexner who was involved with the last four Supreme Court nominations. What moves the needle is if your average person, an independent voter or a moderate Republican, sees inaction on a nominee as the Senate not doing its job, Gottlieb said.  Some 57 percent of Americans believe Obama should name a replacement for the vacant seat while 33 percent say he should not, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.  Events planned by a slew of Democrat-linked groups will feature working Americans telling Senate Republicans to do their jobs, according to a former White House official who is involved in the efforts. Social media will play a big part. A petition under the Twitter tag #DoYouJob has already collected 1.5 million signatures.  A central target is Republican Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, who has said any Obama nominee would not get a hearing before his Judiciary Committee.  Facing a tough Democratic challenger and pressure from liberal activists, Grassley talked with Garland by phone on Wednesday and held out the possibility of a meeting.  Democratic aides say they aim to pressure Grassley into holding a hearing. Whether he does or not, they see Grassley in the meantime struggling to justify his current hard-line position, which they think could help his Democratic opponent in November, former Lieutenant Governor Patty Judge. RE-ELECTION WORRIES Republican senators facing re-election in New Hampshire, Illinois, and Ohio have said they are willing to meet with Garland. Democrats view those seats as among the most promising targets in their effort to win back control of the 100-seat body. Some 34 seats are up for grabs in the Senate, where Republicans have a 54-46 seat majority.  Democrats say the fight could make Senate races in Missouri and North Carolina competitive as well, though independent analysts say they still face an uphill climb. With the election still seven months away, it will be tough to keep the issue at the forefront of voters minds, said Nathan Gonzales, who tracks elections for the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report. Despite the political overtones, Obama opted to pick a relatively uncontroversial candidate. Garland, the top judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, is viewed as a centrist who is not ideologically driven.  Some conservative groups say Garlands past rulings indicate that he would push the court to the left on gun rights, government regulations and other key issues. But others plan to keep the focus on Obama, not his nominee.  If you start eviscerating him in the public sphere, youre going to create sympathy and the White House will use that, said Jason Pye, a spokesman for libertarian group FreedomWorks. Members of the network have sent more than 500,000 emails urging Republican senators to stick to their position, he said. The White House said it had enlisted 356 legal scholars, 217 corporate lawyers and 17 environmental executives in a letter-writing campaign urging Republican senators to act. Some on the left say they may have a hard time rallying their members behind a centrist, 63-year-old white male candidate. We have to go where grassroots energy is. We cant just manufacture it out of thin air, said Neil Sroka, a spokesman for Democracy For Action, a network of 1 million progressive activists. ",politicsNews,"March 17, 2016 ",1

"Trump warns of riots, pulls plug on Republican presidential debate","PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Republican front-runner Donald Trump warned on Wednesday of riots if he is denied the partys presidential nomination and  pulled the plug on a scheduled debate among candidates, raising the temperature even more in a heated White House race.     The outspoken New York businessman scored big wins in primaries in Florida, Illinois and North Carolina on Tuesday, bringing him closer to the 1,237 convention delegates he needs to win the nomination.  Trump also claimed victory in Missouri but lost the crucial state of Ohio, and left the door open for those in the party trying to stop him from becoming the Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election.  Trump might fall short of the majority of delegates required, enabling the partys establishment to put forward another name at the July convention in Cleveland to formally pick its candidate. In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Trump said the party could not deny him the nomination should he fail to win enough delegates. I dont think you can say that we dont get it automatically. I think youd have riots. I think youd have riots. Im representing many, many millions of people.      While the Republicans were mired deeper in turmoil, Hillary Clinton won victories in at least four states on Tuesday that put her in good shape to defeat Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and win the Democratic Partys nomination. Republican Party leaders are appalled at Trumps incendiary rhetoric and reject policies such as his vow to deport 11 million illegal immigrants, temporarily ban Muslims from the United States and build a wall along the Mexican border.     The party tried to play down his riot comments, only days after Trump supporters and protesters clashed at a rally  for the Republican in Chicago that was later scrapped. First of all, I assume he is speaking figuratively, Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer told CNN.     Recent outbreaks of violence during protests at Trump rallies have prompted President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and mainstream Republican figures to speak out against the billionaire.     David Farber, a professor of modern American history at Temple University in Philadelphia, said that, though there have been many episodes of violent unrest at American political events, not least the 1968 Democratic convention, Trumps warning of a riot is unprecedented. The nearest modern comparison would be former Alabama Governor George Wallace, who unsuccessfully ran for president in 1968 as a third-party candidate, Farber said Were in a situation somewhat like the 1960s in the United States, a period of great polarization, Farber said, and there just isnt a lot of common ground, and Trump supporters feel a lot of quiet desperation that Trump is helping to fan the flames of.    In comments likely to raise more concern in the Republican establishment about Trumps lack of experience and temperament,  the former reality TV show host said he was for the most part his own foreign affairs adviser. Im speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain, he told MSNBCs Morning Joe show. I know what Im doing. ... My primary consultant is myself.          Trumps closest national challenger is first-term U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who prides himself in being a grassroots conservative often at odds with Republican leaders.     He too warned of severe reactions against an attempt to stage a so-called brokered convention or contested convention to install a Republican candidate supported by party leaders. I think that would be an absolute disaster. I think the people would quite rightly revolt, Cruz told CNN.  A brokered convention is a complicated process of sequential votes that opens the way for horse trading.    The Republican establishments bid to stop Trump may have come too late as the field of candidates has dwindled to only three, with Trump, 69, in command ahead of Cruz, 45, and Ohio Governor John Kasich, 63, who won his states Republican primary on Tuesday and is the last moderate Republican presidential candidate standing. Growing in confidence, Trump pulled out of a Republican debate scheduled for Monday in Utah, saying it clashed with a speech he plan to give to a pro-Israel group. Debate hosts Fox News then canceled the event.    Senator Marco Rubio quit the White House race after defeat in his home state of Florida. Trump now needs to win about 55 percent of the roughly 1,100 delegates still up for grabs in state-by-state nominating contests to guarantee the nomination. It is not an insurmountable challenge.        Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said it might be tough for the party to block Trump at the convention. A contested convention would be justified if Trump only had around 35 or 40 percent of the delegates locked up. However, if he is very close to getting the majority of delegates, it would be politically difficult for the establishment to try stop him by backroom wheeling and dealing without risking a serious backlash from voters, said Bonjean. The strategist is not affiliated with any of the candidates. Party figures are divided about whether to throw their weight behind Trump despite his downsides or to go on trying to halt him. Florida Governor Rick Scott endorsed Trump on Wednesday but another influential Southern governor, South Carolinas Nikki Haley, declared her support for Cruz, the states Post and Courier newspaper said. The election season is likely to become more politicized after Obama nominated judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, setting up a showdown with Senate Republicans who have vowed to block any Obama nominee.     On the Democratic side, wins on Tuesday for former Secretary of State Clinton, 68, gave her an almost insurmountable edge over Sanders, 74. His campaign said it was not ruling out asking for a recount in Tuesdays tight Missouri race. Seeking to become the United States first woman president, Clinton needs to win only around a third of the Democratic delegates remaining to become her partys nominee.

Obama slaps new sanctions on North Korea after tests,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama imposed sweeping new sanctions on North Korea on Wednesday intended to further isolate the countrys leadership after recent actions by Pyongyang that have been seen by Washington and its allies as provocative. The executive order freezes any property of the North Korean government in the United States and prohibits exportation of goods from the United States to North Korea. It also allows the U.S. government to blacklist any individuals, whether or not they are U.S. citizens, who deal with major sectors of North Koreas economy. Experts said the measures vastly expanded the U.S. blockade against Pyongyang.  North Korea conducted a nuclear test on Jan. 6, and a Feb. 7 rocket launch that the United States and its allies said employed banned ballistic missile technology. Pyongyang said it was a peaceful satellite launch. The U.S. and the global community will not tolerate North Koreas illicit nuclear and ballistic missile activities, and we will continue to impose costs on North Korea until it comes into compliance with its international obligations, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. Despite decades of tensions, the United States has not had a comprehensive trade ban against North Korea of the kind enacted against Myanmar and Iran. Americans were allowed to make limited sales to North Korea, although in practice such trade was tiny.  U.S. officials had believed a blanket trade ban would be ineffective without a stronger commitment from China, North Koreas largest trading partner. But with China signing on to new U.N. sanctions earlier this month, that obstacle has been removed, experts said. North Korean sanctions are finally getting serious, said Peter Harrell, a former senior State Department official who worked on sanctions. The new sanctions threaten to ban from the global financial system anyone, even Europeans and Asians, who does business with broad swaths of Pyongyangs economy, including its financial, mining and transportation sectors. The so-called secondary sanctions will compel banks to freeze the assets of anyone who breaks the blockade, potentially squeezing out North Koreas business ties in China and Myanmar. Its going to be very hard for North Korea to move money anywhere in the world, said Harrell, now with the Center for a New American Security. ",politicsNews,"March 16, 2016 ",1
Pennsylvania governor to veto latest budget as stalemate drags on,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, said on Wednesday that he would veto the latest Republican budget as lawmakers continue their months-long struggle to set a spending plan. The Pennsylvania Senate passed a $30 billion supplemental budget for fiscal 2016 on Wednesday, and the House is also expected to approve the same bill. In its current form, I will veto this budget, and I urge Republicans in the legislature to stop the partisan games and come back to the table to negotiate a final budget that funds our schools and eliminates the nearly $2 billion deficit, Wolf said in a statement. Using the Republicans own math, he said, the budget creates a deficit that would prompt big cuts to education and social programs and lead to higher property taxes. Though Wolf introduced a fiscal 2017 budget on Feb. 9, the state still has only a partial spending plan for this fiscal year, which began July 1. That makes a full 2016 budget nearly nine months overdue. During the impasse, school districts, colleges and social service agencies have all had to make due without state funding. The partial budget Wolf agreed to in December finally sent the first six months of aid flowing to schools, but by then they had gone almost that long without any state money. School districts borrowed a collective $1 billion across the state - incurring up to $50 million in interest and fees - to stay open through December. They are now warning, again, that they could soon have to consider shutting without state funds. The spending plan passed on Wednesday by the Senate does not raise sales or income taxes but restores most of the $6 billion in funding Wolf eliminated in his line-item vetoes in December. The bill would provide $5.95 billion for basic education, a $200 million increase from the previous year. It would also restore higher education funds, including for community colleges, The Pennsylvania State University and Temple University. Wolf took office in January 2015 pledging to restore the previous administrations cuts to education funding. He wanted to pay for it in part with a tax on natural gas extraction, which some Republican legislative leaders have opposed. ",politicsNews,"March 16, 2016 ",1
Obama touts Supreme Court choice as symbol of fair-mindedness,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As valedictorian of his high school class, Merrick Garland let his audience know precisely how he felt when parents unplugged the sound system that day in protest at a classmates speech against the Vietnam War. He may not necessarily have agreed with the topic or tone but, stirred by the sight of a students voice being silenced, Garland abandoned his prepared remarks to deliver instead an impassioned defense of free speech. U.S. President Barack Obama told that story on Wednesday when he nominated Garland, now a 63-year-old judge, on what is often called the second highest court in the land, to a seat on the Supreme Court, the countrys highest court. Obama praised what he called Garlands track record of building consensus as a thoughtful, fair-minded judge who follows the law. Although Garland faces an uphill fight from a Republican-led U.S Senate opposed to anyone the Democratic president nominates, the judge is praised by politicians left and right, even after 19 years on the federal bench. The showdown promises to figure in the campaign for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election with Republicans demanding that Obama leave the seat vacant and let his successor, to be sworn in next January, make the selection. Garland, picked to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13, has been a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since 1997. His appointment to that court, by Democratic President Bill Clinton, was confirmed by the Senate, 76-23. The bipartisan support is one reason Obama might have for nominating him. In 2010, Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, described Garland as a consensus nominee who would get a lot of votes. The court has served as a launching pad to the nine-member Supreme Court for several justices including Scalia. Chief judge since 2013, Garland is viewed as a moderate whose legal approach was shaped by a lengthy career as a federal prosecutor. As a senior Justice Department official, Garland oversaw the prosecution in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing case in which 168 people, many of them children, were killed. He secured the death penalty for the lead defendant, anti-government militant Timothy McVeigh.  Jamie Gorelick, the No. 2 Justice Department official at the time, said in an interview that Garland immediately asked to go to Oklahoma to oversee the case. When the bomb went off in Oklahoma and we started to see the children being pulled out of the wreckage, Merrick, who had young children at the time, was so moved by this and so angered by it he asked if we could send him out to Oklahoma to help, she said. His background as a prosecutor has shaped his views as a judge, lawyers who practice before the appeals court said. Garland is viewed as less defendant-friendly than other Democratic appointees. But Garland is not afraid to rule against the federal government. In a 2013 case, he was part of a three-judge panel that ruled against the Central Intelligence Agency in its bid to keep documents secret concerning the use of armed drones. In 2008, he wrote on behalf of a three-judge panel when the court ruled in favor of a detainee held at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Garland wrote that a U.S. tribunal was wrong to find that detainee Huzaifa Parhat, an ethnic Uighur from China, was an enemy combatant. Garland grew up in Chicago. His mother was a community volunteer and his father ran a small business. Obama said at the White House that Garland had to sell his comic book collection to help fund his college education. Garland would become the fourth Jewish member of the nine-member court. The other five are Roman Catholics. His education also mirrors those of the other justices. If confirmed, all of the justices would have studied at either Yale or Harvard law school. Garland attended Harvard. ",politicsNews,"March 16, 2016 ",1

Illinois no closer to budget deal after key legislative elections,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The two main antagonists in Illinois budgetary stalemate signaled no imminent spending deal on Wednesday, a day after a series of politically symbolic elections tilted in favor of Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan over Republican Governor Bruce Rauner. Madigan and Rauner have feuded since last summer over a fiscal 2016 spending plan, and Illinois has been without a fully-functioning operating budget since July, the longest stretch of fiscal futility in modern state history. Candidates supported by Rauner in the two most expensive, highest-profile legislative primaries Tuesday faced defeat, and an insurgent Democrat backed by Republicans and other anti-Madigan forces failed spectacularly in Rauners bid to unseat the House speaker on his political home turf in Chicago. Madigan said those results should persuade Rauner to drop his effort to tie an anti-union, business-backed agenda to passage of a state budget and focus solely on the most important issue at hand. With the clear message sent by voters Tuesday, I am hopeful we can use this framework moving forward to implement a state budget and work together to get things accomplished for the people we serve, Madigan said in a statement. Several legislative races on Tuesday were regarded as proxy battles in the Madigan-Rauner standoff - none more so than the $6.2 million contest in Chicago to topple incumbent Democratic Representative Ken Dunkin, regarded by many Democrats as a political turncoat for missing a key labor vote opposed by Rauner and failing to vote to reverse human-services cuts made by the governor. President Barack Obama, who had served in the Illinois Senate and then represented the state in the U.S. Senate before moving to the White House, made an almost unheard of endorsement in a state legislative race for Dunkins Democratic challenger, Juliana Stratton, which helped her score a convincing win, which a top Rauner aide sought to minimize. Even in a Democratic primary, the speaker needed to call in the president of the United States to defeat one legislator who dared to show a hint of independent thinking, said Rauner spokesman Lance Trover, insisting that Tuesday was not a total political washout for the governor. Trover cited many races Tuesday in which special interests backed by Speaker Madigan failed to defeat Republican incumbents and candidates who support Governor Rauners call for structural reforms. Rauner sought to punish an incumbent Republican state senator, Sam McCann, from rural Illinois for bucking him on union-backed legislation the governor opposed. In that $4 million race, the second costliest statehouse race in the primary, Rauner personally campaigned with GOP challenger Bryce Benton, who lost to McCann handily. Perception is everything in politics, and to the political community Rauner came up on the short end of a fight with Madigan. So he looks weak and Madigan looks strong, said David Yepsen, the head of Southern Illinois Universitys Paul Simon Public Policy Institute.  Still, Yepsen said, political dynamics that didnt exist prior to Illinois primaries now could make a budget deal easier. Democratic lawmakers facing uncontested elections in the fall might cast Rauner-friendly votes more easily, and voters sent a message Tuesday to Rauner to retool his anti-union, business-backed agenda, Yepsen said. But Rauners administration showed little willingness to do that in a Wednesday statement that needled Madigan for allowing the House to be on a month-long recess despite the ongoing budget stalemate. The primary elections are over and rather than issuing partisan press releases, the speaker needs to end his month-long vacation and begin working with the governor to enact a balanced budget alongside structural reforms that grow our economy, Trover said.

Factbox: How would a brokered Republican convention work?,"(Reuters) - Like any Republican candidate, front-runner Donald Trump needs to collect a majority of the partys 2,472 delegates in state nominating contests to become his partys candidate for the U.S. presidential election in November. If he falls short of that 1,237 threshold, the Republican Partys delegates will need to pick their nominee at a contested convention in Cleveland in July, by following a complex process of sequential votes. Trump currently has 673 delegates, after winning nominating contests in Florida, Illinois, and North Carolina on March 15, according to the Associated Press. That compares with 411 delegates for U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and 143 for Ohio Governor John Kasich. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who had 168 delegates, dropped out of the race on Tuesday night after losing his home state to Trump. At this point, Trump would need to win around 55 percent of the delegates still up for grabs in order to avoid a contested Republican convention in July. That is a tall order for a candidate who has so far been scoring in the mid-to-high 40 percent range in state contests - though his chances could improve given that several upcoming state primaries are winner-take-all. If Trump walks into the convention in July with the most delegates, but falls short of the 1,237 threshold, delegates will start a sequence of floor votes. In the first vote, at least 5 percent of the total 2,472 Republican delegates are unbound - meaning they can vote as they please. The other delegates must vote according to the result of the voting district they represent.  If no candidate reaches the 1,237 threshold in that vote, a second vote is held, this time with a larger proportion of delegates becoming unbound. This process continues, with more delegates becoming unbound with each new vote, until a candidate gets a majority and wins the party nomination to run for the presidency.

Top Senate Republican tells Supreme Court nominee: Senate will not act,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told President Barack Obamas Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland by phone on Wednesday that Republicans will not act on his nomination or meet with him, a McConnell spokesman said.Rather than put Judge Garland through more unnecessary political routines orchestrated by the White House, the leader decided it would be more considerate of the nominees time to speak with him today by phone, McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said in a statement.  McConnell told the appellate court judge that since the Senate will not be acting on this nomination, he would not be holding a perfunctory meeting, but he wished Judge Garland well, Stewart added.

Chances of Republican brokered convention up since Super Tuesday: PredictIt,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The chances that the Republican Party will decide its nominee for the November presidential election through a brokered convention have increased since Super Tuesday even as front-runner Donald Trump has racked up primary wins, according to two online betting sites.  According to PredictIt, the probability of a brokered convention stood at 43 percent as of midday on Wednesday, following primaries in five states, including Florida and Illinois, the previous night. That was up from 35 percent on March 2, the day after Trump won contests in seven out of 11 states, according to the website, which is run by Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand. According to Ladbrokes PLC, another online betting site, the chances of a brokered convention were 4-5 on Wednesday, down from evens on March 2. That means there is a 56 percent probability of a brokered convention, up from 50 percent. Trumps chances of winning the general election dropped to 5/2 from 2/1 despite his victories on Tuesday night, but Ladbrokes attributed the result partly to a large single bet of nearly $20,000 that skewed the results. That gives him a 29 percent probability of winning, down from 33 percent.  The billionaire New York businessman has emerged as the clear leader in the Republican race. On Tuesday, he scored big wins in primaries in Florida, Illinois and North Carolina, knocking out rival Marco Rubio and bringing him closer to the 1,237 convention delegates he needs to win the nomination. But he lost the crucial state of Ohio and left the door open for those in the party trying to stop him from becoming the Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election. That means that Trump might fall short of the majority required, enabling the partys establishment to put forward another name at the July convention in Cleveland to formally pick its candidate. Meanwhile, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clintons chances of winning the presidency fell to 4/9 from 8/15. That increases her probability of winning to 69 percent from 65 percent following Tuesdays primary victories in Florida, Illinois, Ohio and North Carolina. Those wins cast doubt on U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders ability to overtake her for the Democratic Partys nomination. ",politicsNews,"March 16, 2016 ",1
"After crucial win, Kasich sees path to Republican nomination","BEREA, Ohio (Reuters) - After a critical win on his home turf, Ohio Governor John Kasich begins a new phase of his long-shot presidential campaign that his aides hope will ultimately propel him past Republican front-runner Donald Trump by triggering a rare contested convention. Kasichs victory in Ohios primary on Tuesday, along with the departure from the race of U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, makes him the party establishments last hope of stopping the New York billionaire businessman from winning the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election. Trump and his closest rival, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, are deeply unpopular among Republican insiders. I want you to know, the campaign goes on, Kasich, 63, told a victory rally near Cleveland. In a reference to Trumps fiery campaign rhetoric, Kasich added: I will not take the low road to the highest office in the land. Trump, 69, notched wins in Florida, Illinois and North Carolina on Tuesday and was projected by MSNBC to win a close race with Cruz in Missouri. But losing Ohios winner-take-all contest for 66 delegates complicates his attempt to clinch the 1,237 delegates needed to win his partys nomination before the partys July convention in Cleveland. With most of the remaining states allocating delegates proportionally, Kasichs aides believe he could prevail at a convention at which no candidate enters with a majority. The plan is to win Ohio, and some other states, and if that happens, nobody is going to have enough delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot, said John Weaver, Kasichs chief campaign strategist, who also worked on Republican Senator John McCains losing presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2008. Kasichs plan, according to aides, is to leverage the momentum to gather more endorsements from mainstream party insiders and Republican donors.  With the wind at his back, he hopes to score more victories in upcoming primaries including Pennsylvania, Maryland, Wisconsin, Connecticut and California, where he believes the terrain is friendlier to his brand of Republican moderation. To become the nominee who faces Democratic contenders Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders  in the November election  a Republican needs to win a majority of the 2,472 Republican delegates. After last nights contests, excluding Missouris, Trump leads with 619 delegates, followed by Cruz with 394. Kasich has 136. If no candidate reaches that threshold by the close of the last primary on June 7, the convention will almost certainly be contested  a recent historical rarity that would signal deep party rifts. No convention, by either party, has gone beyond a first ballot since 1952.  Kasich has almost no hope of winning enough delegates to secure the nomination outright. Ohio is the lone state he has  won. But if he can succeed in blocking Trump from getting a majority, he can make a case to convention delegates that he is more electable than Trump or Cruz, 45, a conservative evangelical and, to date, Trumps most successful Republican rival. Signs of the Republican establishment rallying behind Kasich were on show this week. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012 who recently blasted Trump as a fraud in a scathing speech, campaigned with Kasich in Ohio on Monday. He has the kind of record that you want in Washington, Romney said in North Canton, Ohio, on a stage next to Kasich, who spent 18 years as a Republican congressman and six as Ohio governor. You look at this guy, and unlike the other people running, he has a real track record. On Wednesday, Kasich heads to a campaign event in Pennsylvania and then holds three events in Utah on Friday  where Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, is popular with Republicans. Utah, with 40 delegates, votes on March 27. Pennsylvania is one of five states voting on April 26. Ford OConnell, a Republican strategist who has stayed neutral in this years nominating fight, said Kasichs victory should earn him more help from party insiders. There are really just two options left: Either Trump gets enough delegates, or nobody does, OConnell said. Kasichs win in Ohio means Trump must now win roughly 60 percent of the remaining delegates before the convention. I would say we now have a 50-50 chance of a brokered convention. OConnell said that under Republican party rules, a candidate must receive a clear majority of primary votes overall to become the nominee.  The history of Republican nominating fights is littered with candidates who received a plurality of the votes, but not a majority, and never became the nominee. Kasichs aides are looking to history as a guide, particularly Wendell Willkies path to the 1940 Republican nomination. That year, three leading candidates  Robert Taft, Thomas Dewey and Arthur Vandenberg  each arrived at the convention without enough delegates to win. Willkie - a businessman and former Democrat who had never before run for public office - opposed the Republican Partys isolationists and was a supporter of Britains war efforts. His cause gained momentum after the Nazi blitzkrieg in Europe in May 1940. After six ballots at the convention, delegates in Pennsylvania, New York and Michigan deserted other candidates and switched to Willkie, giving him victory. Trump, Cruz and Kasich could face the same scenario this year, which would force to them to lobby delegates on the convention floor until one emerged with a majority. A lot of people who do not want Trump have been sitting back to see how Kasich and Rubio do in their home states on Tuesday, saidRepublican strategist Charlie Black, who signed up on Tuesday night as a Kasich adviser.

Rubio ends White House bid after humbling home-state loss,"MIAMI (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Marco Rubio suspended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday, having lost his home state of Florida despite support from a party establishment worried about the rise of billionaire Donald Trump. While this may not have been the year for a hopeful and optimistic message about our future, I still remain hopeful and optimistic about America, Rubio, 44, told supporters in Miami after his projected loss to Trump.  It was a second straight disappointing week for Rubio. Last week in nominating contests in Michigan and Mississippi, he drew only single-digit support. A first-term senator, Rubio had been considered by many mainstream Republicans to be the last best option to defeat billionaire businessman Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas for the partys nomination for the Nov. 8 election. His voice strained and hoarse, Rubio did not launch the attack on Trump that many observers had expected, but instead seemed to rationalize the anger he said that led so many of his fellow Floridians to support Trump over himself. Rubio congratulated Trump but also took several veiled jabs at the real estate developers campaign tone, saying Republicans should not prey on fear and anger.  From a political standpoint, the easiest thing to have done in this campaign would be to jump on all of those anxieties, to make people more angry, to make people more frustrated, but I chose a different route and Im proud of it, Rubio said.  In recent weeks Rubio had become more aggressive in attacking Trump. The personal insults appeared to backfire and Rubio later said he regretted them. After former Republican Governor Jeb Bush quit the race, Rubio drew some of his financial backers to his side. But it took weeks for him to win a primary, notching wins only in Minnesota, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. Supporters had encouraged Rubio to get out of the race before the Florida voting after he consistently trailed in opinion polls, arguing that losing to Trump in the primary in his own state would hamper his future in politics. Rubio has already said he will not run for re-election to his Senate seat. There has been speculation he could run for governor in 2018.  History has shown Republicans never mind a second act and if a Trump candidacy fails, Rubio is likely to be the starting point the GOP looks to as it charts the way back from another White House defeat, said Texas-based Republican strategist Joe Brettell. Rubios departure leaves three candidates in the race  Trump, Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Establishment Republicans will now likely give Kasich a hard look, since most oppose Trump or Cruz being the nominee. Once he announced he was suspending his campaign, there were cries of No! and Dont quit! but most in the crowd had seemed to know what was coming.  Volunteers in T-shirts began to weep and hug one another. The rest of the crowd left the arena for the balmy night. ",politicsNews,"March 16, 2016 ",1

Merrick Garland is exactly the type of Supreme Court nominee you get when you make deals in Washington D.C., he said in a statement that also criticized rival Donald Trump, who often boasts of his ability to close deals.   A so-called moderate Democrat nominee is precisely the kind of deal that Donald Trump has told us he would make - someone who would rule along with other liberals on the bench like Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor.

Senate advances bill to aid drug-dependent newborns," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan bill designed to improve the health and safety of babies born to mothers who used heroin or other opioids during pregnancy was approved by a U.S. Senate committee on Wednesday.  The bill, which will now move to the Senate floor, waspromptedby aReutersinvestigation last year.READ MORE: Helpless & Hooked: The infantvictims of America's opioid epidemic Reuters found110casesof children who were exposed to opioids while in the womb and who later died preventable deaths at home. No more than nine states comply with a 2003 law that calls on hospitals to alert social workers whenever a baby is born dependent on drugs, Reuters found.  This is a major bipartisan agreement that will seek to fill the gaps in this program that Reuters first exposed in their groundbreaking investigation, said Senator Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat and a co-author of the bill. These are our most vulnerable children and we have an abiding obligation to ensure theyre cared for.  The proposal approved by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committeeon Wednesdaycalls for better plans of safe careto helpdrug-dependent mothers raise newborns as the babies suffer through opioid withdrawal.  If it becomes law, the measure would also require states to report each year the number of infants identified as born drug-dependent, and the number for whom plans of safe care are developed. Thousands of newborns do not receive such plans, Reuters found.  The proposal, which does not include additional funds, is part of a compromise struck between Casey and committee chairmanSenator Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican.  The bill also requires the Health and Human Services Department to better monitor state policies intended to protect drug-dependent newborns.  On Tuesday, also in response to the Reuters series, HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said her agency had revamped its policies for protecting thousands of babies and planned to be more pro-active.  Burwell made her remarks in testimony before a U.S. House committee in which she said HHS was reviewing unspecified problems in South Carolina.  South Carolina officials this week confirmed they had been ordered by HHS on March 4 to improve their policies on drug-exposed newborns, but they did not provide details.

Senate blocks bill that would override state GMO labeling laws,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Wednesday blocked a bill that would nullify state and local efforts to require food makers to label products made with genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, as the industry races to stop Vermonts law from taking effect on July 1. The proposed legislation from Republican Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas comes amid growing calls for transparency in the U.S. food supply. Labeling advocates have criticized the bill as toothless because it leaves the decision to disclose GMO ingredients to the companies whose products contain them. Senate Bill 2609 is known as the Biotech Labeling Solutions Act by supporters and the Deny Americans the Right to Know, or DARK, Act by opponents. A procedural vote on Wednesday failed to reach the necessary 60 votes to advance the bill in the Senate, with 49 yes votes and 48 no votes. Roberts vowed to keep fighting as the July 1 deadline looms for Vermonts labeling requirement to take effect.  I remain at the ready to work on a solution, Roberts said. The United States is the worlds largest market for foods made with genetically altered ingredients. Many popular processed foods are made with soybeans, corn and other biotech crops whose genetic traits have been manipulated, often to make them resistant to insects and pesticides. Major food, farm and biotech seed companies spent more than $100 million in the United States last year to battle labeling efforts, according to a lobbying disclosure analysis from the Environmental Working Group, which opposes the Senate measure.  Opponents to GMO labeling efforts include trade groups such as the Grocery Manufacturers Association, whose members have included PepsiCo Inc and Kellogg Co, and BIO, which counts Monsanto Co, Dow AgroSciences, a unit of Dow Chemical Co, and other companies that sell seeds that produce GMO crops among its members. They say labeling would impose speech restrictions on food sellers, burden consumers with higher costs and create a patchwork of state GMO labeling policies that have no basis in health, safety or science. But companies such as Whole Foods Market Inc, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc and Campbell Soup Co already have begun labeling or abandoning GMOs rather than waiting for government action.

Factbox: Reaction to Obama's Supreme Court nominee,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama nominated veteran appellate court Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court on Wednesday, setting up political showdown with Senate Republicans who have vowed to block any Obama nominee. Following is a selection of reaction to the decision: The American people may well elect a President who decides to nominate Judge Garland for Senate consideration. The next president may also nominate someone very different. Either way, our view is this: Give the people a voice in the filling of this vacancy. If Merrick Garland cant get bipartisan support no one can. ... We hope the saner heads in the Republican Party will prevail on (U.S. Senator) Chuck Grassley and (Senate Majority Leader) Mitch McConnell to do their job and hold hearings so America can make its own judgment as to whether Merrick Garland belongs on the court. PAUL RYAN, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES SPEAKER, THE TOP ELECTED U.S. REPUBLICAN: This has never been about who the nominee is. It is about a basic principle. Under our Constitution, the president has every right to make this nomination, and the Senate has every right not to confirm a nominee. ORRIN HATCH, REPUBLICAN U.S. SENATOR OF UTAH: Everybody I know who works with him thinks highly of him, but I do think it ought to be put off. This is a toxic environment right now. Its terrible. And Ive been through enough of these where Im sick of the way the court is treated. And this would be just another one. SUSAN COLLINS, REPUBLICAN U.S. SENATOR OF MAINE: Judge Garland is a capable and accomplished jurist.  The White House has requested that I meet with him, and I look forward to doing so, as has been my practice with all Supreme Court nominees. Evaluating and confirming a Justice to sit on this nations highest court should not be an exercise in political brinkmanship and partisan posturing. It is a serious obligation ... That obligation does not depend on the party affiliation of a sitting president, nor does the Constitution make an exception to that duty in an election year. Judge Garland has the experience and the legal acumen to serve on the highest court in the land.... The American people expect Judge Merrick Garland to be given a fair hearing and a timely vote. When Americans head to the polls in a few short months, they will have a unique opportunity to determine the direction of the court  President Obama is doing a disservice to voters with this attempt to tip the balance of the court with a liberal justice in the eleventh hour of his presidency. We are in the midst of a highly-charged presidential election that is less than eight months away, and this lifetime appointment could reshape the Supreme Court for generations.I believe the best thing for the country is to trust the American people and allow them to weigh in on this issue.   His (Garlands) impeccable credentials, steadfast fidelity to the law and firm devotion to the public interest make him an outstanding choice to sit on our nations highest court, where I am certain he will serve with integrity and wisdom. The Senates constitutionally defined role to provideadvice and consentis as important as the presidents role in proposing a nominee, andI will assess Judge Merrick Garland based on his record andqualifications. I look forward to evaluating Merrick Garlands qualifications to be a justice on the Supreme Court. Senators have a constitutional obligation to advise and consent on a nominee to fill this Supreme Court vacancy and, simply put, we have a responsibility to do our jobs as elected officials.  Should Merrick Garland be nominated again by the next president, I would be happy to carefully consider his nomination. DEBBIE WASSERMAN-SCHULTZ, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRWOMAN: Justice Garland has earned the support of Republicans and Democrats alike since 1997. I urge Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley to fulfill their constitutional duties, hold hearings, and quickly bring this nominee up for a vote, the exact same thing called for in 2008 when President Bush nominated judges that were then confirmed by a democratic Senate.

House Speaker Ryan will not accept a presidential nomination,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, will not accept a nomination to be a U.S. presidential candidate, his spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said on Wednesday. The speaker is grateful for the support, but he is not interested. He will not accept a nomination and believes our nominee should be someone who ran this year, Strong said in an email to Reuters. She was responding to a report by Politico that quoted former Speaker John Boehner as saying that Ryan should be the Republican nominee for president if the party fails to choose a candidate on the first ballot at the convention in July.  If we dont have a nominee who can win on the first ballot, Im for none of the above, Boehner said at the Futures Industry Association conference in Boca Raton Florida, Politico reported on Wednesday. They all had a chance to win. None of them won. So Im for none of the above. Im for Paul Ryan to be our nominee. Ryan, who is from Wisconsin and became House speaker last year, has been touted as a possible dark horse candidate for president, should the Republican convention fail to agree on any of the current contenders on the first ballot. Ryan has repeatedly insisted that he does not want to run for president this year, and a committee that sought to draft him closed last week after Ryans office urged a halt to its activities. Ryan ran for vice president in 2012 on the unsuccessful Republican ticket with presidential contender Mitt Romney.  U.S. Republican front-runner Donald Trump scored big wins in Republican primaries in Florida, Illinois and North Carolina on Tuesday which brought him closer to the 1,237 delegates he needs to win the nomination. But he still might fall short of the majority required, enabling the party establishment to put forward another name at the July convention in Cleveland. A spokesman for Boehner said Wednesday that the former speaker, who is from Ohio, had endorsed that states Governor John Kasich in the presidential race.

Republican money class fears stigma of becoming Trump donors,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Donald Trump inches closer to becoming the U.S. Republican nominee, many of the partys big donors fear they will tarnish their reputations should they contribute to a candidate who has insulted women, Hispanics and Muslims. Some flatly reject the notion of ever funding his campaign. In interviews with Reuters, 22 members of the Republican money class spoke of the anguish, struggle, and Catch-22 they now find themselves in, especially in light of the violence at Trump rallies and the candidates refusal to denounce it. Two additional high-profile Republican donors, Gaylord Hughey of Texas, who backed Jeb Bushs Super PAC, and Ronald Firman of Florida, who poured more than $2 million into a conservative Super PAC, said they were still undecided and hoped Trump would tone down his inflammatory rhetoric and urge his supporters to eschew violence. Trump won at least three states on Tuesday but his loss in Ohio means the Republican nominating convention in July may be contested if he falls short of winning a majority of delegates in the state-by-state contests. Republican donors are a testing ground for Trump, who is under pressure to soften his tone to win independent voters. Even an unorthodox campaign like his is expected to need some money for television ads and staff should he reach the general election. The billionaire real estate developer may find it difficult to fund this with his own wealth. Throughout the 2016 election, many establishment donors have viewed themselves as dedicated soldiers, willing to go to any lengths to prevent either Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, or her rival Bernie Sanders from winning the Nov. 8 election to succeed President Barack Obama. But some Republicans said they worried that becoming a Trump donor could taint legacies,family names and personal brands. Many said they disagreed with his protectionist trade policies, his calls for the building of a wall on the Mexican border and his proposal for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Energy magnate and mega donor Dan Eberhart said he was concerned about Trumps lack of specificity on foreign policy and some of his rhetoric. We wont be donating to Trump, and I dont know any of our donor peers that would donate, said Eberhart, who was a supporter of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker in the race. If hes the nominee, we will support him in spirit but not in cash. I mean, in some ways its refreshing to have a candidate who is not completely scripted but at the same time he lacks the decorum and stage presence and gravitas to deal with foreign leaders on the world stage. Added Denver technology executive Chris Wright, Its an anguishing position to be in, but we just couldnt support him if he were the nominee. Were appalled.Hes anathema to the free society and civil society in which we believe. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. In the run-up to the convention Trump has vowed to self-fund his campaign. He has pledged to do away with the pay-to-play, transactional politics that have long dominated Washington. But were he to become the partys nominee, the growing consensus among campaign veterans is that a general election would cost hundreds of millions of dollars, a total that Trump may well be less able to self-fund. Trump will likely face a barrage of attack ads and negative mailings funded by Super PACs, labor unions and the campaign of his Democratic opponent. Answering the charges on the airwaves would require more than just giving interviews and prove costly.  In a debate last week Trump said he had yet to decide whether to seek donations in a general election campaign. To date, Trumps controversial comments and his celebrity status - he is a former reality TV show host - have made him a regular presence on network television, allowing him to avoid spending as much as his rivals on paid television advertising.  He has run a threadbare campaign from his plane and employs a tiny staff with no strategists, consultants or pollsters.  Trump spent a mere $3.20 per vote versus now-dethroned rivals Bush and Marco Rubio, who spent $551.70 and $30.40, respectively. Trump could always try to keep up his unconventional low-budget tactics. But Republican challenger Mitt Romneys failure to respond to President Barack Obamas television attack ads in 2012 offer a cautionary tale about not responding when an opponent goes on the offensive. What you (will) see is a lot of people concede if Trump is our nominee that weve lost the White House, lets protect the majority in the Senate and the majority in the House, said David McIntosh, president of the Club For Growth, a conservative organization that has spent millions of dollars on ads aiming to defeat Trump in the primaries. In the 2012 presidential race, Romney and Obama each spent $1 billion. Should Trump decide to seek campaign donations, some Republicans would be willing to open their wallets. Bob Grand, who led Romneys Indiana fundraising in 2012, said he would write Trump a check. We dont have any alternative. We dont have any choice, hes going to be better than Hillary Clinton, thats for damn sure, Grand said. Trump could also use his large social media presence to solicit small donations via his website. That could add up to large sums.  Trump could decide to court business people who do not normally get involved in politics, potentially turning to supporters such as billionaire businessman Carl Icahn and NASCAR chairman Brian France. If Clinton is the Democratic nominee, she and her allies will have millions of dollars with which to attack Trump. But before Trump can take on Democrats, he will have to confront the internal battle within his own party. He may feel the pressure to fundraise if his opponents Ted Cruz and John Kasich keep the fight up through the convention as Democrats launch their own attacks.  This is the coming donor apocalypse, said Florida strategist Rick Wilson. And for those donors who go turncoat like (New Jersey Governor) Chris Christie, and join up with Trump, they will be heaped with all the hate and opprobrium they deserve.

Embattled Chicago prosecutor defeated in election primary,"(Reuters) - Voters in Chicago have ousted embattled Cook County States Attorney Anita Alvarez, who has been harshly criticized for her handling of a police shooting investigation.  Preliminary Democratic primary results on Tuesday showed Alvarez, 56, was handily defeated by Kim Foxx, an African-American who capitalized on criticism the two-term prosecutor received for taking more than a year to charge Jason Van Dyke, a white officer, who fatally shot a black teenager in 2014.   The stakes in this race were very high, Foxx said during her victory speech. I understand the excitement, but let us not get lost in the gravity of the work that is ahead of us. Foxx, 43, will face Republican Christopher Pfannkuche, who ran an uncontested primary race, in the general election in November. Alvarez will remain in office until then. Killings of black men at the hands of mainly white law enforcement officials in U.S. cities over the past two years have prompted demonstrations across the country and stoked a national debate on race relations and police tactics. Alvarez charged Van Dyke on Nov. 24 with first-degree murder more than a year after he shot Laquan McDonald 16 times. The October 2014 shooting was captured on patrol car dashboard-camera videos that were released on the day Van Dyke was charged, setting off weeks of protests.      Politicians, pastors and civil rights advocates called for Alvarez to resign, saying she only filed the murder charges because she was under pressure after the videos were made public.  We find ourselves in this country, not just here in Cook County, in a great climate of change and in reform in the criminal justice system, Alvarez said during her concession speech.  After Van Dyke was charged, Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy was fired and the U.S. Justice Department launched an investigation into the Chicago Police Department.  This is what justice looks like, said organizers of Assatas Daughters, a local black womens advocacy group, on a Facebook video post.  Foxx served as assistant states attorney for Cook County for 12 years and then as chief of staff for the Cook County Board president. Born to a teenage mother, she spent part of her childhood in Chicagos Cabrini Green public housing complex and in a homeless shelter.  Kims life experience has given her a deep understanding of the impact of crime, violence and poverty on our communities, her campaign website said.  ",politicsNews,"March 16, 2016 ",1
How Rubio’s campaign failed: problems from the start,"MIAMI (Reuters) - Marco Rubio had all that you need in a Republican presidential candidate: fluency on the issues, a conservative outlook, crossover appeal as a Cuban-American, and youthful good looks.  But in an election year when anyone associated with the Republican establishment is seen as tainted, Rubio ended his  campaign after New York real estate mogul Donald Trump won the coveted primary, or nominating contest, in Rubios home state of Florida on Tuesday. This may not have been the year for a hopeful and optimistic message about our future, Rubio told supporters as he announced his decision.    How the 44-year-old U.S. senator got to this point is a story of miscalculations and missed opportunities, according to interviews with more than a dozen campaign officials, financial donors and Republican strategists. Rubio attempted to position himself as a new-age Republican, the son of Cuban immigrants who was able to connect with everyday voters with tales of his hard-luck upbringing. He also tried to appeal to Americas growing Hispanic population to help boost his partys chances of claiming victory in the Nov. 8 election.  He got off to a difficult start. His advisers wanted to run a campaign where it made more sense to be on Fox News, a channel popular with Republicans, or on other cable networks and local broadcasters whose clips can go viral on social media, rather than spend a lot of time in small towns in Iowa and New Hampshire. The early nominating contests there often shape the narrative and direction of presidential elections. So Rubio made a strategic gamble. He would try a different approach in those two states, strategists familiar with his campaign said. He would try to save time and money by making strategic stops in those states rather than carpet-bomb them with multiple visits. It would be a break from the usual playbook of White House hopefuls that says candidates should saturate Iowa and New Hampshire with town halls and other events and aim for early wins to garner media coverage and campaign donations and build momentum. Rubios gamble backfired. Republican activists in Iowa complained he was largely absent from the state for long stretches, not spending the face-to-face time necessary to sell himself. He only made an all-out push in the late stages of the race. Throughout the campaign, Rubio has battled perceptions that he does not work hard enough. For other candidates running for president, a voting record in the Senate would be a minor issue. But for Rubio, missing votes on the Senate floor dovetailed with the narrative that was building on the trail. If he was not in the Senate and was not on the trail, where was he? Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said Rubio faced more than $50 million in attacks ads. Obviously that had a massive impact. I think we could have won Iowa had it not been for the more than $25 million in attacks spent on us in Iowa alone. Republican rival and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas tried to visit every Iowa county on a bus. Rubio tended to fly in and fly out. Polls showed he typically did better in metropolitan areas, not the hamlets than can often make or break candidates in early states. Cruz won Iowas caucuses on Feb. 1 with Trump second. Rubios third-place finish was seen as something of a victory by his camp, but Republicans in the state were not so sure.  He had a chance to win Iowa, said Jamie Johnson, a Republican activist in Iowa. As Johnson traveled the state ahead of the caucuses, voters often asked him when Rubio would visit their area, he said. Iowans like being visited in their home county, he explained.If a presidential candidate wants to win in Iowa, then he must put in the shoe leather.  Rubios team said he had tended to campaign in major population centers in Iowa in order to get the most impact from the news media. I was very pleasedwith the campaign that we ran here and I thought the national team did a very good job and I had no complaints, said Iowa state Senator Jack Whitver, who was the head of Rubios Iowa campaign. NO-SHOW AT DINNERS Rubio heard similar complaints in New Hampshire. He spent just 28 days campaigning there, about half as much as former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and a fraction of the some 70 days that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Ohio Governor John Kasich were there.  Fergus Cullen, a former chairman of the state Republican Party, sought to hold meet-and-greet events at his home for each candidate. Candidates such as Bush and Kasich took him up on it. Rubio did not. Cullen eventually aligned himself with Kasich, who went on to finish second to Trump in the state. There were a lot of opinion leaders - key endorsers who end up on a candidates delegate list - who were interested in Rubio but never got to meet him or have those small-group, private meetings that result in commitments, Cullen said. Renee Plummer, a real-estate developer and an influential conservative activist in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, who hosted more than 10 Republican candidates for intimate dinners with local leaders, said she tried to schedule Rubio three separate times to no avail. She eventually threw her support behind Christie.  Rubio faced another problem: a perception that he could only muster well-worn talking points.  At a July 6, 2015, dinner at a Chicago steakhouse with reporters, he appeared relaxed and knowledgeable. But as the campaign intensified, that Rubio appeared less and less frequently, replaced by a candidate who seemed able only to deliver canned lines and talking points.  Christies campaign noticed. Days before the Feb. 9 New Hampshire primary, Christie caught Rubio in repeat mode during a debate, calling him robotic and scripted. It affirmed some voters doubts that he lacked depth. Rubio never quite recovered.  What happened to Marco in New Hampshire struck a responsive chord, said John Mac Stipanovich, a prominent Florida lobbyist who first supported Bush and then switched to Rubio. It crystallized that lack of stature.  Trumps unrelenting dominance of the media spotlight made it hard for rivals to shine. But Rubios decision, starting with a debate in Houston on Feb. 25,to try to match Trump insult for insult was cited by voters as another wrong move. Rubio has since said he regretted the negative turn.  A campaign source said it was Rubio who made the ultimate decision to switch gears and attack Trump personally, motivated in part by a desire to win more media coverage. It worked. At a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Monday, he ruefully noted that when he was engaged in his war of insults with Trump, CNN and other networks carried his events live, something they had not done before.  That was, in a nutshell, the problem. Months of wall-to- wall news coverage of Trump decimated Rubios strategy of using free-media avenues.  You cant out-Trump Trump, said Rubio supporter Jim Bundstein in Florida.  For some, the roots of Rubios problems can be traced back further to an icy afternoon in Washington on Jan. 28, 2013. That is when he held a news conference with three Democratic senators and a Republican on Capitol Hill to launch immigration reforms.  The legislation, sponsored by what became known as a bipartisan Gang of Eight senators, would have created a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, but only if steps were taken to secure the U.S. southern border with Mexico and strengthen visa tracking.  Rubio had already faced conservative anger when flirting with immigration reform a year earlier, when he proposed a path to citizenship for young people who came to the country illegally but would join the military.  Conservative columnist Ann Coulter derided those ideas as nothing but amnesty for lawbreakers.  The Gang of Eight bill ran into similar resistance. As Rubio distanced himself from it, Hispanic groups faulted him for giving up.  In a Republican primary race where Trump has thrilled many conservatives by vowing to deport immigrants and build a wall on the Mexican border, Rubios involvement in the legislation and sudden abandonment of it haunted his 2016 campaign. It was the centerpiece of attack ads by his rivals and the independent fundraising groups supporting them. At a rally in Tampa, Florida, on Monday, Trump said of the senator: Hes weak on immigration. Hes very weak on amnesty. I dont know how he got elected. ",politicsNews,"March 16, 2016 ",1
USDA chief says farmers looking ahead to possible Cuba markets,"LIMA (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said Tuesday that farm officials want to lay the groundwork so American agricultural exporters can seize new opportunities in Cuba if the trade embargo on the country is lifted. The normalization of trade relations would allow U.S. farmers to use lower transportation costs to edge in on the European Unions food exports to Cuba, Vilsack said. President Barack Obama has been using his executive powers to chip away at the half-century-old trade embargo, imposed on the communist-ruled nation in 1960, but cannot lift it without approval from Congress that is unlikely under current Republican leadership. There are still preliminary steps that can be taken to prepare for that day, Vilsack said in an interview in Peru. When it happens, the United States will be in a very good position to reclaim a portion of the market weve lost. Vilsack cited soybeans, rice, poultry and biofuels as new markets U.S. farmers could tap in Cuba, which in turn could sell organic products to its former Cold War foe. The Obama administration is asking Congress for $1.5 million for on-the-ground studies into challenges to agricultural trade in Cuba, from pests to a diplomatic void left by decades of hostile relations. We have not had people on the ground, Vilsack said. We need to develop relationships with the people in Cuba so we know who to do business with and who actually makes the deals. Vilsack, who visited Cuba last month, said state agricultural commissioners and secretaries have also been traveling to the island on trade missions. They have been down to Cuba and they have come back with small contracts for commodities, Vilsack said. Vilsack said farmers were the most excited about the reopening of relations with Cuba, once a global sugarcane powerhouse. The U.S. would aim to meet 50 percent of Cubas food and agricultural needs if trade resumes fully, up from less than 15 percent now, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a statement to Reuters after the interview. Vilsack also said he was optimistic Obama would persuade Congress to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal before the end of his term, despite the recent surge in anti-trade rhetoric in presidential campaigns. The president is very committed to getting it done and he intends to work as long and hard as he needs to ultimately get it passed, Vilsack said. ",politicsNews,"March 16, 2016 ",1
All clear at Rubio campaign office after white powder scare,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential hopeful Marco Rubio said his staff was safe after his Washington campaign headquarters was evacuated over a suspicious white powder. Glad campaign staff in DC is all safe! Thanks to DC emergency personnel, Rubio said in a tweet. Campaign spokesman Alex Conant told the Washington Post that the substance, which was found by a worker in an envelope at around 4 p.m., turned out to be laundry detergent. Rubio was campaigning on Tuesday in his home state of Florida, one of five states holding primaries for the Republican party. A suspicious substance found at the Houston campaign headquarters of U.S. Republican presidential contender Senator Ted Cruz last week was determined to be non-toxic, a local media report said, citing a Cruz campaign official.

Trump says foreign policy team still not ready," (This version of the story was corrected to change Waurishuk statement to say willing not happy in paragraph 10) By Mark Hosenball and Susan Heavey WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump acknowledged on Tuesday he does not yet have a foreign policy team, and        three former U.S. military and intelligence officials who have endorsed him are little known in either the Republican Party or the wider foreign policy community. The New York billionaire, who had promised to name his foreign policy and national security advisers last month, told MSNBC that he has met with people but made no decision yet on who to advise him on global affairs. Asked whether he had a team, Trump said on Tuesday: Yes, there is a team. Well, theres not a team. Im going to be forming a team at the appropriate time. Ive met with far more than three people.      Trump has given hints of the kind of advisor he would hire to promote his national security policy, much of which is focused on cracking down on Islamic State. He also promises to gut global trade deals and build a wall on the Mexican border to halt illegal immigration. Asked during a debate last week who he trusts on national security, Trump had warm words for three men with world views that differ from one another: former diplomat Richard Haass and retired U.S. Army officers Gen. Jack Keane and Col. Jack Jacobs.                      And on his campaign website last month, Trump announced that he had received endorsements in Florida from two top national security experts.  Foreign policy experts say they know little about those Trump supporters.  They are Gary Berntsen, a former senior CIA officer, and retired Colonel James Waurishuk, a one-time deputy chief of intelligence for U.S. Central Command during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq who also once served on the National Security Council staff.       These people are not well known in foreign policy circles...I never heard of any of them, said Harvard professor and former Kennedy School of Government dean Joseph Nye. Waurishuk said on Tuesday he would have been willing to give advice if asked, by any presidential candidate, including Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Apart from Trump, however, Waurishuk said that the only other candidate he had contact with was Republican Jeb Bush, who he says snubbed him when they met at an event in 2014. Bush ignored me and walked away, Waurishuk said.   Former CIA officer Berntsen is perhaps the best known of the three endorsers. A participant in efforts to hunt down Osama bin Laden, he later wrote a book entitled Jawbreaker, The Attack on Bin Laden and Al Qaeda.  According to The Hill newspaper, one of its contributors, J.D. Gordon, has also endorsed Trump. Gordon is a former Navy commander officer and former Pentagon spokesman.  On Tuesday, Trump described U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions from Alabama, as someone he would consider for his team, adding that he would make a decision in due time. Sessions is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and one of the few senior mainstream Republicans to endorse Trump. Sessions is not known as one of the partys leading foreign policy voices in the Senate. He opposes comprehensive immigration reform and supports tight border security measures.        On Tuesday, Trump, dismissed criticism that his harsh rhetoric would damage Americas standing in the world.     Foreign diplomats from Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia have expressed alarm to U.S. government officials about Trump, calling his public statements inflammatory and insulting. The businessman shot back, saying diplomats are upset over his tough stance on trade and returning jobs to the United States as he seeks the partys nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Every country is ripping us off in trade, and other things. And they know that wont happen with me. Im going to bring trade back, Im going to bring our jobs back, Trump told Fox News.

Graphic account of Hulk Hogan sex tape read in Florida court,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (Reuters) - Gawker founder Nick Denton read out a graphic account of the acts shown in a sex tape featuring wrestling celebrity Hulk Hogan in a Florida courtroom on Tuesday, saying his companys 2012 online publication stands up to the test of time. Gawker was sued for $100 million by Hogan, who says the release violated his privacy. The New York-based media company could be forced out of business by an unfavorable verdict in a civil trial testing the limits of freedom of the press. Hogans attorneys asked Denton, a high-profile figure in the world of Web publishing, to read aloud a very explicit article accompanying the video, which he did in an even tone. The lawsuit centers on the one-minute, 41-seconds of video that Gawker excerpted from the sex tape of unknown origin. It  has not yet been shown to the jury in St. Petersburg, Florida, near Hogans home. The clip shows Hogans tryst with the wife of his then-best friend, radio shock jock personality Bubba the Love Sponge. Hogan says their consensual encounter was recorded without his knowledge five years before Gawkers posting.  Denton said he had not watched the video, nor read the article before publication. He described his role as broadly overseeing the portfolio of websites under Gawker media. Still, he stood by the piece as in keeping with Gawkers mission to produce true and interesting journalism. The piece had value. It was true. It was a story honestly told and it was interesting to millions of people, Denton said. The Hogan sex tape piece was one of more than 10,000 posts in 2012 on the Gawker website, a former company executive testified later on Tuesday. The video alone was viewed 2.5 million times, with 57 percent watching the entire clip. Dentons testimony, spread out over two days, highlighted his approach to websites run by the Gawker company, which include technology-oriented Gizmodo and women-focused Jezebel. Pressed on his views on privacy rights during cross-examination, Denton said celebrities have a smaller zone. Jurors had questions for Denton, too. One of them asked if the sex in the video would be protected speech under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution if it was gratuitous. No, he replied. He had previously said that he did not think the sexual content overreached. Hogans attorney, David Houston, issued a statement suggesting the jury question perhaps sets the tone for deliberations.

Secret Service manpower shortage as campaigns ramp up,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Secret Service, tasked with simultaneously protecting President Barack Obama and some of the Republican and Democratic candidates now running to replace him next year, is facing a manpower shortfall at a time of peak demand, the agency told Congress on Tuesday. Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy told a House Appropriations panel the agency is focused on human capital needs across the organization and accruing enough agents to ease overtime demands on the existing force. The Secret Service hopes to have 7,600 agents in its ranks by fiscal year 2019, up from the current figure of approximately 6,200, Committee Chairman John Carter of Texas said during Tuesdays hearing.  While Clancy said the Secret Service was making progress in hiring more agents, we have yet to see the desired impact on our overall staffing levels due to increased attrition.  Clancy testified at a hearing to review the agencys funding needs for the fiscal year starting on Oct. 1. Demands of the mission are peaking, he added, with Republican and Democratic presidential nominating conventions slated for this summer, the general elections in November and presidential inaugural events in January.  Carter cited the loss of 19 agents in the last four months and the large amounts of overtime hours agents have had to put in on the presidents detail, on the campaign trail and in the uniformed division. Carter, a Republican, questioned whether the services hiring goals were obtainable with the agency losing more agents than they have brought on board. Clancy responded that the agency is exploring initiatives to lure more applicants and retain current agents.  The Secret Service was rocked in 2012 when it surfaced that some agents working a presidential trip to Colombia were involved with prostitutes. In 2014, agents failed to stop a man who jumped the White House fence, ran across the lawn and made it into the mansion before he was apprehended.  More recently, during a rally for presidential candidate Donald Trump in Radford, Virginia, a Time magazine photographer was grabbed by the neck and shoved to the ground by a Secret Service agent. An agency spokeswoman said the service is investigating the incident. Besides protecting the president and presidential candidates, Secret Service agents investigate financial crimes such as counterfeiting of U.S. currency and credit card and fraud.

Democrats push SEC nominees on corporate political spending,"(Reuters) - Democrats in the Senate made a concerted push on Tuesday during a confirmation hearing for nominees to the Securities and Exchange Commission to require corporations to disclose political contributions. Senator Charles Schumer of New York threatened to vote against confirming the nominees, Lisa Fairfax and Hester Peirce, if they did not clearly state support for requiring corporations to make their political donations public. The SEC is certainly not responsible for patching that hole in our campaign finance system, but you can help prevent that hole from being ripped any wider, Schumer said. Shareholders remain in the dark as executives of public corporations funnel money into our political system with no transparency or accountability. Other Democrats, including Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, made similar comments. The securities regulator has faced mounting pressure to require contributions disclosure from corporations since the Supreme Court struck down strict limits on campaign finance in its 2010 Citizens United decision.  Menendez said 1.2 million people have written to the SEC about the disclosure requirement.  Budget legislation passed by the Republican-majority Congress at the end of 2015 blocked the SEC from creating a rule on political spending. Peirce, a Republican who is a senior fellow at the Marcatus Center at George Mason University, noted the SEC is charged with carrying out laws and said she would not undermine the budget legislation if she is confirmed.  Fairfax, a Democrat who is a law professor at George Washington University, said she would uphold the budget law. She added, though, that she believes political spending could be material information to shareholders making investment decisions.  Peirce and Fairfax were nominated by President Barack Obama in October, and Tuesdays hearing was the first step in confirming the nominations.  Republican Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, the committees chairman, said he expected the nominations to come to the floor for a vote.  Still, the confirmations could stretch on for a while given the political divide in Congress and the debate about financial regulation in the presidential election.  The divide has made confirming nominees difficult. Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, noted Obama sent the committee 19 nominations to consider in the past 15 months and it approved only one.  Meanwhile, the hearing turned to issues that are taking center stage in the presidential campaigns. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who advocates for financial regulation, pressed Peirce about her public criticism of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law put in place after the financial crisis. Many Republicans consider the law a regulatory overreach, while some Democrats view it as a way of preventing another crisis. What you propose, from what I can tell in your writings, is less oversight of big banks, fewer efforts to reign them in, more chances for them to take on big risks to boost their profits and, if things go wrong, come crying to the government for another bailout, Warren said. The question is whether someone should be put in charge of enforcing laws that they think are unnecessary or counterproductive. Peirce said she would implement the law as a commissioner. She added that she made her critiques as an academic and not a regulator. Senator Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota, brought up the issue of gun ownership and pushed Fairfax about an amicus brief she signed that questioned WalMarts gun sales. Fairfax said she was not sending a signal about the underlying issue but signed the brief to say companies must communicate corporate policies to investors. ",politicsNews,"March 15, 2016 ",1
Obama calls for a halt to 'vicious' tone and violence on campaign trail,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Tuesday he was dismayed about violence and divisiveness on the U.S. presidential campaign trail and, in a reference to Republican front-runner Donald Trump, called on leaders to clean up the tone of the race. We have heard vulgar and divisive rhetoric aimed at women and minorities, at Americans who dont look like us or pray like us or vote like we do, Obama said during an event on Capitol Hill. Weve seen misguided attempts to shut down that speech. However offensive it may be, we live in a country where free speech is one of the most important rights that we hold. In response to those attempts, weve seen actual violence. And weve heard silence from too many of our leaders. Obama spoke as Americans in five states - Ohio, Florida, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina - voted in the latest round of primaries to select the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates for the November election. Trump has drawn wide criticism, including from within the Republican establishment, for a campaign that has included calling Mexican immigrants rapists and proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. There have been some clashes in recent days at his rallies between his supporters and protesters. Trump, a New York real estate magnate, has dismissed accusations that he has fueled the violent atmosphere. Obama said this years campaign cycle was not an accurate reflection of the United States. It has to stop, the Democratic president said, describing the atmosphere of the campaign as vicious, and adding that the behavior can undermine our democracy, our society and even our economy. Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate Majority Leader, told reporters that Trump had called him on Tuesday. I took the opportunity to recommend to him that no matter who may be triggering these violent expressions or conflicts that weve seen in some of these rallies, it might be a good idea to condemn that and discourage it, McConnell said. He declined to comment on Trumps response.  U.S. Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida and Ohio Governor John Kasich are challenging Trump for the nomination. I suspect that all of us can recall some intemperate words that we regret. Certainly I can, Obama said. And while some may be more to blame than others for the current climate, all of us are responsible for reversing it. ",politicsNews,"March 15, 2016 ",1

Obama administration reverses course on Atlantic oil drilling,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration reversed course on Tuesday on a proposal to open the southeastern Atlantic coast to drilling as an oil price slump and strong opposition in coastal communities raised doubts about the plan. Besides market and environmental concerns, the U.S. Interior Department said it also based its decision on conflicts with competing commercial and military ocean uses. The decision, which is sure to reverberate in the presidential election campaign, reverses a January 2015 proposal for new leases in the Atlantic as part of the departments five-year plan to set new boundaries for oil development in federal waters through 2022. We heard from many corners that now is not the time to offer oil and gas leasing off the Atlantic coast, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said.  When you factor in conflicts with national defense, economic activities such as fishing and tourism, and opposition from many local communities, it simply doesnt make sense to move forward with any lease sales in the coming five years. Hillary Clinton, the front-runner in the race for the Democratic Partys nomination to run in the Nov. 8 presidential election, has moved to the left on environment under pressure from green groups. She tweeted: Relieved Atlantic drilling is now off the table. Time to do the next right thing and protect the Arctic, too. Donald Trump, the businessman and former reality TV personality who is the Republican front-runner, has raised questions about whether more offshore drilling is necessary given the abundance of onshore shale production. The proposal would have opened up drilling sites more than 50 miles off Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia to oil drilling by 2021.  Coastal communities in these states protested the administrations plan, fearing the possibility of an oil spill like the BP Horizon accident in 2010 on the U.S. Gulf Coast, and its effects on tourism and their economies. With this decision coastal communities have won a David vs. Goliath fight against the richest companies on the planet, and that is a cause for tremendous optimism for the well-being of future generations, said Jacqueline Savitz, environmental group Oceanas vice president for U.S. oceans. Virginia officials had welcomed the initial plan to allow offshore drilling, saying it would bring economic benefits. On Tuesday, Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, said he was surprised that the Department of Defense had raised concerns about naval installations, one of which is off the states coast. The DOD has been relatively quiet during this public debate and has never shared their objections with me before, he said. Major oil companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp, Shell and Chevron, had pushed for an open Atlantic. Shell Oil Company spokeswoman Natalie Mazey said the decision was short sighted and would jeopardize the abundance of affordable domestic energy the economy has become dependent on.     The American Petroleum Institute said the decision goes against the will of voters, governors and members of Congress who support more development. The decision appeases extremists who seek to stop oil and natural gas production which would increase the cost of energy for American consumers and close the door for years to creating new jobs, new investments and boosting energy security, said API President Jack Gerard. The Interior Department also announced Tuesday that it would evaluate 13 other potential lease sales in other areas of the country - 10 in the Gulf of Mexico and three off the coast of Alaska. The proposal focuses potential lease sales in areas with the highest resource potential, greatest industry interest, and established infrastructure, Jewell said. The Interior Department said that in the Gulf, resource potential and industry interest are high and infrastructure already exists.  It proposes two annual lease sales that include the Western, Central, and part of the eastern Gulf of Mexico not subject to the current congressional moratorium.  It also includes a potential sale each in the Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, and Cook Inlet planning areas in Alaska. The department would take comments on other options, including an alternative that includes no new leasing. While green groups praised the decision to keep the Atlantic off limits for now, they raised concerns that the United States would keep the door open for drilling in the vulnerable U.S. Arctic. The administration must take Arctic leases out of the final five-year plan, said Cindy Shogan, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League. No place has potentially more to lose due to climate change than the Arctic. The Interior Department will open the five-year proposal to a 90-day comment period. ",politicsNews,"March 15, 2016 ",1
No word Tuesday on Supreme Court nomination: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration does not plan any announcement on Tuesday on a nominee for the Supreme Court, the White House said. President Barack Obama has said he plans to soon present a nominee to fill the vacancy on the high court left by the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, despite a stated refusal by Republican leaders in the Senate to consider any nominee during Obamas final term. Spokesman Josh Earnest was responding to a question at a regular White House briefing. ",politicsNews,"March 15, 2016 ",1
Liberal groups urge non-violent movement to stop Trump,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. liberal groups, divided in their support of Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, have urged a united, active opposition to Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner. In an open letter released on Tuesday, a group of liberal organizations called for a non-violent movement to thwart Trumps candidacy for Novembers general election, calling the New York billionaire a hate-peddling bigot who openly incites violence.  This is a five-alarm fire for our democracy, said the letter, which was signed by the leaders of the liberal advocacy group MoveOn.org, a supporter of Sanders, and the Service Employees International Union, a major labor union that is backing Clinton.  Representatives of 20 other groups signed the letter, which was published online as Americans in five states voted in the latest round of primary contests to pick party nominees for the Nov. 8 election. Trump has alarmed many in America, not just liberals, with his campaign rhetoric, from calling Mexican immigrants rapists and drug dealers to his proposal to ban Muslims temporarily from entering the United States. Protests have become a recurring, noisy feature at Trumps rallies and in recent days, tensions have risen sharply as a few of Trumps mostly white supporters have punched or bloodied protesters, many of whom are black or Latino, in scuffles in or outside campaign venues. The open letter urged Americans to use tactics familiar from the civil-rights movement to oppose Trump, including large public marches and prayer vigils. It told Americans to ask every media outlet, corporation, and office-holder whether they will condemn what the letter described as Trumps racism, misogyny and xenophobia. The letter also called for efforts to increase voter turn-out in November, hoping to beat Trump if he becomes the Republican nominee.  Some Republican politicians, including the partys presidential nominee in 2012, Mitt Romney, have also called for efforts to prevent Trump winning the partys nomination in July, including tactical voting. A Trump spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. Trump has said in media interviews he does not condone violence, but at rallies he has sometimes encouraged people to use force on protesters, drawing condemnation from both Democratic and Republican politicians.  Many protesters have told journalists they are supporters of Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, and Clinton, a former secretary of state. Trump, who canceled a rally in Chicago last week after hundreds of protesters got inside the venue, has said  it is unfair that his events are disrupted more than those of any other candidate.

Energy market affected decision on Atlantic drilling: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Energy market dynamics factored into the decision by the Obama administration to reverse course on a proposal to open the southeastern Atlantic coastal area to oil and gas drilling, the White House said on Tuesday. There were also objections from the Department of Defense, commercial interests and local communities, a White House spokesman said. The U.S. Interior Department said earlier on Tuesday that it would not allow drilling in the area, reversing a January 2015 proposal for new leases in the Atlantic as part of the departments five-year plan to set new boundaries for oil development in federal waters through 2022.

House Republicans float controversial budget plan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Republicans on Tuesday insisted they will proceed with a fiscal 2017 budget plan despite a flat-out rejection from their partys fiscal hawks that poses an important test of Speaker Paul Ryans leadership.  The $3.9 trillion proposal, which the House Budget Committee hopes to embrace formally on Wednesday for an eventual floor vote, would provide Ryan with a first step in his political goal of uniting the Republican Party behind a detailed policy plan ahead of Novembers presidential and congressional elections. The plan aims to achieve a balanced budget within a decade.  I promise in this speakership that were not going to have a top-down, cram-it-down-peoples-throat kind of leadership, Ryan told reporters.  Were going to make decisions as a team. Were going to push power out to the members, and were going to make a team decision on this issue, he added.    But the House Freedom Caucus, which includes dozens of outspoken conservatives who dethroned Ryans predecessor John Boehner, has been complaining for months about a $1.07 trillion ceiling for discretionary spending that was enacted into law last November. It says the cap should be $30 billion lower and has warned leaders of its opposition.  Several Freedom Caucus members sit on the House budget panel, including Representative Dave Brat, a Virginia Republican who described the groups position as mainstream: Were where the American people want us to be. Brat said he was leaning toward voting against the proposal in a committee work-session set for Wednesday. Stubborn opposition among Freedom Caucus members, despite weeks of behind-the-scene talks among House Republicans, call into question the ability of party leaders to muster the 218 votes needed to pass the budget without help from the chambers 188 Democrats. Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the panels top Democrat, slammed the Republican proposal as a plan that would hurt the middle class and harm the Medicare healthcare program for the elderly and disabled. Democratic attacks and fiscal hawk opposition are leading some Republicans to call for a seldom-used Queen of the Hill strategy that would allow members to consider different proposals but deem the one with the most votes as having passed the chamber. The budget blueprint is non-binding, meaning it is not subject to President Barack Obamas approval. But it provides guidance to appropriators as they write bills to fund an array of government programs beginning Oct. 1, the start of the next fiscal year.  ",politicsNews,"March 15, 2016 ",1

A Wall Street Journal reporter said Kasich answered in the affirmative to a question about Romneys endorsement. Kasich spokesman Chris Schrimpf said, This is not true. Kasich was responding and acknowledging a different question.

Four Breitbart journalists quit after alleged Trump rally assault,"(Reuters) - Two reporters and two editors from Breitbart News resigned to protest how the conservative website handled an alleged assault last week on one of the reporters by a senior aide to Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump. Reporter Michelle Fields filed a criminal complaint on Friday against Trumps campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, saying he grabbed her arm at a rally on March 8 in Florida with such force that he left bruises. Lewandowski and Trump have denied the accusation. The incident sparked a spat at Breitbart, with journalists accusing management of kowtowing to the Trump campaign. Breitbart published an account on Friday of the incident that raised questions over Fields version of events and suggested it was not Lewandowski who grabbed her. According to a report on Saturday on the BuzzFeed news website, Breitbart senior editor-at-large Joel Pollak also ordered staffers in an internal chatroom to stop defending Fields. Fields and editor-at-large Ben Shapiro resigned in response to that late on Sunday. National security correspondent Jordan Schachtel and editor Jarrett Stepman resigned on Monday, according to a letter by them that was posted to Twitter, in which they accused the news site of becoming a propaganda arm for the Trump campaign. (bit.ly/1pHhUc9) Breitbart News Chief Executive Larry Solov said in an emailed statement late on Monday, Breitbart News thanks Kurt, Ben, and Michelle for their work for us. We wish each of them the best in their future endeavors. He was referring to Kurt Bardella, who resigned as Breitbarts spokesman last week.  The alleged assault on Fields took place days before a series of clashes between supporters of Trump, the front-runner to be the Republican presidential candidate in Novembers election, and protesters at campaign rallies.  The allegations were being investigated, a spokesman for the Jupiter, Florida police department said on Monday. ",politicsNews,"March 14, 2016 ",1
Anti-Trump protesters: patchwork of people and Facebook pages,"KANSAS CITY, Mo./BLOOMINGTON, Ill. (Reuters) - Donald Trump has called them thugs, professional organizers and supporters of Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders. But the protesters who have stepped up their actions against the Republican presidential front-runner are a disparate group from different walks of life, with no national organization to speak of. They assemble through a patchwork of Facebook pages and myriad advocacy groups. After demonstrators swarmed a large Trump rally in Chicago on Friday and forced its cancellation over security concerns, protesters are looking for ways to keep up the momentum as the billionaire businessman seeks in primaries this week to clear a path toward the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election. Trump has drawn fervent support as well as harsh criticism, including from within his own party, for his calls to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and impose a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. Kevin Bailey, 25, who helped lead an anti-Trump protest on behalf of the Progressive Youth Organization at the candidates Kansas City, Missouri, rally on Saturday, said protesters had two goals - to disrupt proceedings as much as possible and signal their outrage over Trumps divisive rhetoric. Trump spent a good part of his time on stage shouting down the protesters. Bailey said his group watched a similar protest staged by a sister organization in St. Louis on Friday as well as other protests to see if there were lessons to be learned. We want to learn what works as far as, especially, going inside and disrupting rallies, he said. Using smaller groups of protesters to enter rallies and station themselves around the venue, as well as staggering the disruptions to maximize their duration, are some of the strategies that seem to work best, Bailey said. Before Fridays rally at the University of Illinois at Chicago, organizers used Facebook and worked with student groups on campuses in the Chicago area to encourage them to attend. Inside the stadium, there might have been as many protesters as supporters and a long line of people were waiting to get in when the Trump campaign scrapped the event. Skirmishes broke out between the two camps, making for some tense minutes that received national television coverage and raised security concerns around the Trump campaign.   One organizer, Nathaniel Lewis, a 25-year-old graduate student, said the cancellation was the last thing we expected to happen. It shows the power of unity. It happened just days before five nominating primaries on Tuesday in which Trump, 69, is trying to cement his lead over his remaining Republican rivals - U.S. Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Trumps Republican and Democratic rivals accused him of sowing tension with divisive rhetoric. But on Sunday, he said: I dont accept responsibility. I do not condone violence in any shape. He called the protesters professional disrupters sent to his events by Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours! Trump said on Twitter on Sunday. Trumps campaign rallies have been boisterous, with the real estate mogul often pausing to scold protesters and ask security officers to take them away. At some events, protesters and journalists have been punched, tackled or hustled out. A 78-year-old man was charged with assault and communicating a threat after he was seen on video punching a young black protester at a North Carolina rally last week. The threat of violence affected Trump personally on Saturday. Secret Service officers rushed on stage to protect Trump when a man broke through a security barrier at a rally in Ohio. Trump said the man was looking to do harm. Some in the Trump camp believe the protesters actions in  Chicago will benefit their candidate by galvanizing his supporters.  Some people were energized, said Michael McKinney, 47, as he attended a Trump rally in Ohio with his family on Sunday. I watched a lot of videos - all the protesters were throwing the first punch, he added.     Over the weekend, President Barack Obama made a call for civility in the political process and resolving our differences without encouraging or resorting to violence. While young people are a visible contingent among the protesters and some are supporters of Sanders, the demonstrators are a mixed group operating in small clusters.  For a Trump rally in Bloomington, Illinois, on Sunday, Sonny Garcia, a 44-year-old facilities manager, said a loosely organized group called Dump Trump Illinois rallied protesters through a Dump Trump Facebook page. Some 2,000 people gathered. Forty members of the local chapter of a national anti-hate advocacy group called Not in Our Town showed up to protest,  wearing white armbands. High school student Aishwarya Shekara, 16, joined them. Im here because Trump stands for everything I dont, she said. Hes the definition of a demagogue. ",politicsNews,"March 13, 2016 ",1
Trump will not be charged with 'inciting riot' in North Carolina,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - A North Carolina sheriffs office said on Monday it would not charge Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump or his campaign with inciting a riot at a rally in the state last week. North Carolina is one of five states holding Republican and Democratic primary elections on Tuesday in the race to select candidates for Novembers U.S. presidential election. The Cumberland County Sheriffs Office, based in Fayetteville, earlier had said it was reviewing whether Trump or his campaign incited a disturbance at a rally last Wednesday. At the rally in Fayettsville, John McGraw, a 78-year-old white Trump supporter, was arrested on a misdemeanor assault charge after he was seen on video punching a 26-year-old black protester in the face. On Monday evening, the Sheriffs Office said in a statement it would not seek a warrant or indictment for Trump or his campaign over the incident. The Sheriffs Office legal counsel advised, and the Sheriff concurred, that the evidence does not meet the requisites of the law as established under the relevant North Carolina statute and case law to support a conviction of the crime of inciting a riot, the office said. In North Carolina, inciting to riot is a legal charge that can apply to a public disturbance and does not necessarily involve a full-scale riot. The offense can be classified as a misdemeanor or a more serious felony. During a trip on Monday to North Carolina, Trump rejected suggestions that his language was to blame for recent clashes at his rallies.

Inside Kasich's long-shot strategy to beat Trump to the GOP nomination,"HEATH, Ohio (Reuters) - Microphone in hand, Republican John Kasich promised the crowd inside a high-tech Ohio factory Saturday that hell never be beholden to Washington insiders if he wins the White House in November. But as he zigzags across the state before Ohios GOP primary on Tuesday - emboldened by polls showing him edging ahead of rival Donald Trump - Kasich may soon need all the Washington insiders he can get. Behind the scenes, strategists for Kasich, the Ohio governor, are studying arcane party rules that they believe could offer a path to the Republican nomination if he wins his home state, his aides said. It is a long-shot strategy, both for Kasich and the anti-Trump forces inside the party. But if fellow GOP candidate Marco Rubio loses his own state of Florida on Tuesday - as polls predict - a surge by Kasich may be the only viable strategy for Republicans looking to stop Trump from getting the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination. A loss by Rubio, a senator, will almost certainly end his struggling candidacy. If Trump wins both Ohio and Florida, the New York real estate moguls march to the nomination will be all but assured. The Kasich camp sees a Rubio loss in Florida opening up a different possibility  the first contested convention held by either party since 1952. The plan is to win Ohio, and some other states, and if that happens, nobody is going to have enough delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot, said John Weaver, Kasichs chief campaign strategist, who also worked on Republican Senator John McCains losing presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2008. Kasich supporters are betting that an Ohio win will give his candidacy its first real momentum, attracting donors and endorsements.From there, he could score more victories in upcoming primaries in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Wisconsin, Connecticut and California, states where Kasich polls favorably. He has almost no hope of winning enough delegates to secure the nomination outright. But if he can succeed in blocking Trump from getting a majority, Kasich can make a case to convention delegates that he is more electable than Trump or Ted Cruz, the conservative evangelical from Texas and, to date, Trumps most successful Republican rival. To become thenominee who faces Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders  the two leading Democrat candidates  a Republican needs to win a majority of the 2,472 Republican delegates. Trump is leading, with 460, followed by Cruz with 370, Rubio at 163 and Kasich at 63. If no candidate reaches that threshold by the close of the last primary on June 7, then the convention will almost certainly be contested  a historical rarity that would signal deep party rifts. 1940 CONVENTIONKasichs aides are looking to history as a guide, particularly Wendell Willkies path to 1940 Republican nomination. That year, three leading candidates  Robert Taft, Thomas Dewey and Arthur Vandenberg  each arrived at the convention without enough delegates to win. Willkie - a businessman and former Democrat who had never before run for public office - opposed the Republican Partys isolationists and was a supporter of Great Britains war efforts. His cause gained momentum after the Nazi blitzkrieg in Europe in May 1940. At the convention, after six ballots, delegates in Pennsylvania, New York and Michigan deserted other candidates and switched to Willkie, giving him victory. Trump, Cruz and Kasich could face the same scenario this year, which would force to them to lobby delegates on the convention floor until one emerged with a majority. The Kasich campaign and Republican elites  many of whom have a distaste for both Trump and Cruz  are planning for just such a scenario, Weaver said. But because it has been more than a half century since the last brokered convention, he said, Nobody knows exactly how this works. Despite 18 years as a Republican congressman, and now six as Ohio governor, Kasich has cast himself as a Washingtonoutsider in hopes of tapping the anti-establishment mood that has fueled Trumps once-improbable front-runner status. Guess what? The establishment is afraid of me because I dont take orders from anybody over there, Kasich said in a recent television interview.  At other times, he appears to revel in his Washington experience. I took on Washington and I won. I actually got the budget balanced when I was a member of the Congress, he said in a March 11 debate. The Republican establishment is watching Kasich and Ohios Tuesday primary closely, said Charlie Black, a Republican strategist and a former adviser to Mitt Romney, the Republican 2012 presidential nominee, who recently blasted Trumps campaign. A lot of people who do not want Trump have been sitting back to see how Kasich and Rubio do in their home states on Tuesday, he said. If Kasich wins, I think hell see a pick-up in donors, and in help from members of the party. Ford OConnell, a Republican strategist not affiliated with any presidential candidate, expects Kasich to face a tough battle even if he wins Ohio. But for some of these anti-Trump voters, if they can get Kasich to a contested convention, they see that as their best hope of blocking Trump. Until now, the relationship between Kasich and party elites has been prickly. On Feb. 21, the Rubio campaign had released a memo calling for Kasich to quit the race, while a string of party insiders endorsed Rubio as the establishment candidate most likely to defeat Trump. Thats changing. After the Republican presidential debate in Florida last week, Kasich flew on Friday morning to Lima, Ohio, for an event with voters. As he landed, he and aides switched on their phones and saw emails telling them that Rubio adviser Alex Conant had just publicly urged voters in Ohio who wanted to stop Trump to vote for Kasich instead of Rubio, according to several aides. We were not expecting them to do that, said a Kasich campaign spokesman, Chris Schrimpf. ",politicsNews,"March 14, 2016 ",1
Palin curtails Florida appearances for Trump rally after husband's accident,"TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - A serious snowmobile accident involving Sarah Palins husband forced the former vice presidential nominee to curtail a Florida campaign trip on Monday for Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump.  Todd Palin was in intensive care at an Alaska hospital after the accident on Sunday, an aide to the former Alaska governor said, adding she had been on the phone with doctors and family members all morning.  Palin, who has endorsed Trump, had been scheduled to campaign for him later on Monday in The Villages, Florida. Florida is one of five states holding nominating contests on Tuesday for the Nov. 8 election. Trump campaign officials said Palin was returning to Alaska to be with her husband. They said they looked forward to her being back on the campaign trail soon and that Trumps thoughts and prayers were with the Palin family.  Before being able to catch a flight to Alaska, Palin stopped at a town hall-style event for Trump in Tampa, telling the crowd: Thank you guys for your prayers for my husband who is recovering right now in ICU after a little wreck on a snow machine.  Trump, taking the stage after Palin, said: Her husband is a tough cookie but when youre too tough, you break ribs every once in a while. Palin, Republican Senator John McCains running-mate in the 2008 presidential election won by Democrat Barack Obama, held a separate campaign rally for Trump in Florida on Sunday. Todd Palin, 51, is a veteran participant in Alaskas 2,000-mile (3,200-km) Iron Dog race involving snowmobiles that takes place each February, according to the races website. The contest features about 40 two-man teams. Palin has been on a winning tandem three times, most recently in 2007, race organizers said.  While competing in 2008, Palin was injured when his vehicle struck a snow-hidden barrel and he was thrown some 70 feet (20 meters), the Alaska Dispatch News reported, adding he was not seriously injured.

Trump's appeal divides Tea Party loyalties in crucial states,"(Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has effectively split the conservative Tea Party movement, as his fiery campaign draws in followers of the group who had been expected to line up behind Ted Cruz, a more consistent champion of small government. As the Republican race moves to the crucial battlegrounds of Ohio and Florida among three other states on Tuesday, Tea Party support promises to help Trumps campaign offset its relative lack of on-the-ground organization compared to Texas Senator Cruz, his closest rival nationally. Having loyal Tea Party supporters could also help him fend off moves to block his nomination at the Republican National Convention in July if he falls short of the threshold of 1,237 delegates that would guarantee him the partys candidacy.  A Reuters review of Trumps list of 66 Ohio delegates  who would represent him at the nominating convention if he wins the primary and provide crucial support in the event of a contested convention  found that 28 are Tea Party leaders, members or are otherwise linked to the movement, including officials who have been featured speakers at Tea Party events.  Using the same benchmark, 27 of Cruzs delegates have links with the grassroots group, which sprang to national prominence in 2009 on anger over government bailouts, and demands for tax cuts and less intrusive government. Despite Trumps mixed record as a conservative, the real estate moguls promises to shake up Washington, throw out illegal immigrants and tear up unfair trade deals have won over many influential Tea Party followers, according to interviews with activists across more than a dozen states. Trump has never asked me for a dime and being self funded hes the only one that can blow up the Republican Party establishment, said Ralph King, a Trump delegate and member of the Cleveland Tea Party.  If the primaries result in a contested convention, Im in his corner all the way. (Graphic showing Trump Ohio delegates with Tea Party links:tmsnrt.rs/1Xr3aZw) Recent polls have shown Trump performing well among voters who identified as Tea Party supporters.  A Feb. 29 CNN poll had 56 percent of Tea Partiers favoring Trump compared to 16 percent for Cruz. A March 9 Quinnipiac University poll had Trump leading Cruz 48 percent to 40 percent among Tea Party voters in Florida, while Cruz led Trump with 38 percent to Trumps 33 percent in Ohio. Trump has tapped into Tea Party emotions, gaining the support of many of the most hacked off and motivated voters out there, said Republican strategist Ford OConnell. It was a brilliant move.  The influence of the amorphous Tea Party has waned nationally, but it remains a potent force in many states through its thousands of committed grassroots activists. For conservative purists, Cruz checks all the right ideological boxes of limited government and lower taxes.  Trump, on the other hand, says he would maintain government programs such as Social Security and has called for higher taxes on the most wealthy Americans. In 2008, he voiced support for the governments rescue package for major banks. After Trumps strong showing in a string of states on Super Tuesday last month, Jenny Beth Martin  co-founder of a national umbrella group called Tea Party Patriots - lambasted him as a conservative of convenience. Trump is about love of himself. But the Tea Party is about love of country and the love of our Constitution, she said at this months Conservative Political Action Conference.  Ned Ryun, founder of American Majority, a group that trains conservative grassroots activists, said Trumps outsider persona is key to his appeal to Tea Party activists.  Cruz people feel they can work within the status quo, said Ryun. Trump people say screw the status quo, were sick of it. The billionaire has quietly maintained contacts with the movement since at least 2011, when he was flirting with a presidential run in the 2012 election. More recently he has courted activists, focusing on prospective delegates. Trump broadened his appeal among Tea Party members in January when he secured the endorsement of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, who commands strong loyalty among many in the movement. At the South Carolina Tea Party convention in January 2015 in Myrtle Beach, Trump spent 45 minutes with eight Tea Party activists, test-marketing themes like immigration, according to attendees.  The effort brought converts. One of those present, Gerri McDaniel, ran Trumps grassroots efforts in South Carolina. Another, Jeanne Seaver, did the same in Georgia. He won both states primaries. Atlanta Tea Party co-founder Debbie Dooley also attended that meeting and aims to be a Trump delegate.  On the first ballot of the Republican convention in July she would be obliged to back him, but says she would continue to back him if voting goes to a second round when delegates become free to vote for whichever candidate they choose. Ill back Trump to hell and back, Dooley said. In Michigan, New Hampshire and Nevada, Trumps successful efforts were helped by state directors formerly employed by Americans for Prosperity, a group backed by the billionaire Koch brothers that has courted Tea Party groups for years. His Florida field director Ken Mayo held the same post at Americans for Prosperity. Trump tapped a local Tea Party leader  Rob Scott  to run his campaign in Ohio. Of Trumps 21 delegates from New Hampshire  the first primary he won  13 have Tea Party links or affiliations. Delegate lists for Florida and Michigan  another state that votes on Tuesday  are not yet available because those states pick delegates at conventions after their primaries. In Ohio, candidates submit delegate lists in advance. Trump still trails Cruz on get-out-the-vote efforts, strategists and activists say. June Pitts, a Tea Party activist in Illinois, said in previous elections she has worked at campaign offices. But Trump doesnt have one in Chicago, so Pitts is making calls herself ahead of the states March 15 vote.  In Tiffin, Ohio, Trump delegate Jim Green said he spent $700 of his own money on yard signs before the campaign began sending him paraphernalia for free.  Glenn Newman, a Trump delegate and activist in southeastern Ohio, has also been left to his own devices.  Trumps campaign is being put together like a puppy chasing a pickup truck, Newman said. Theyre just playing catch-up.  ",politicsNews,"March 15, 2016 ",1
U.S. eases Cuba trade and travel rules ahead of Obama visit,"WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - The United States unveiled new measures on Tuesday to make it far easier for Americans to visit Cuba and eased limits on the use of U.S dollars in trade there as President Barack Obama prepared to make a historic trip to Havana next week. Rolling out some of the most significant changes since Obama announced his opening to Cuba in December 2014, U.S. officials expressed hope that the further relaxation of travel and financial rules would spur the islands Communist government to respond with economic reforms that have been slow to come. The new measures will allow Americans to travel more easily to Cuba independently for educational, cultural and other authorized purposes without having to go in organized group tours, creating new cracks in a longstanding U.S. ban on general tourism to the island. The new rules are the latest in Obamas efforts to chip away at sanctions against Americas former Cold War foe by using his executive powers to sidestep U.S. lawmakers, who have so far resisted his call to lift Washingtons more than five-decade-old economic  embargo on Cuba. The easing comes as Obama prepares to make a March 20-22 trip to Cuba, 90 miles (145 km) from the southern tip of Florida, the first sitting U.S. president to visit in 88 years. Obamas critics accuse him of giving up too much in return for too little from Cuban President Raul Castro and of now taking a premature victory lap. Since Obama and Castro announced the detente in December 2014, the two countries have restored diplomatic relations and opened embassies in Havana and Washington. The changes announced on Tuesday allow Cubans to open U.S. bank accounts and authorize those Cubans living in the United States to earn a salary or compensation, which could open the door to American big-league baseball teams signing Cuban players without them having to defect. It certainly does address the ability of Cuban athletes who can earn salaries in the United States to do so, Ben Rhodes, Obamas deputy national security adviser, told reporters. U.S. officials declined to predict how this might affect Major League Baseball, which is in negotiations with the U.S. and Cuban governments. The relaxed travel restrictions, combined with the resumption of regularly scheduled airline service to Cuba later this year, will greatly increase the ability of Americans to visit the once-forbidden island. American travelers will be largely bound only by the honor system to declare that their travel is authorized, though U.S. officials said they would be monitoring the situation. U.S. travel to Cuba soared 77 percent to 161,000 visitors in 2015, according to Cuban government data, even though Americans going there must fit 12 authorized categories. U.S. officials say travel rose around 50 percent, a discrepancy explained by Americans illicitly traveling to Cuba as tourists through third countries. Todays steps build on the actions of the last 15 months as we continue to break down economic barriers, empower the Cuban people and advance their financial freedoms, and chart a new course in U.S.-Cuba relations, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said in a statement.          Although as many as 20 members of Congress are set to travel with the president, the Republican-led body has not moved to support Obamas policy shift by lifting the broad embargo. Instead, the U.S. Treasury and Commerce Departments said in a statement they would enact a range of changes to provide access to U.S. financial transactions for Cubans as well as to broaden access to the island for others.  The new rules will increase the ability of Cubans in United States to earn stipends and salaries beyond living expenses, the departments said. The changes also allow humanitarian and other entities supporting the Cuban people to establish a presence there, they said. The administration earlier eased rules to allow scheduled air service between the two countries.  ",politicsNews,"March 15, 2016 ",1
"Todd Palin in intensive care after snowmobile accident, wife says","(Reuters) - Former U.S. vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin on Tuesday said her husband is still in the intensive care unit of an Alaska hospital with multiple injuries, including broken bones and a collapsed lung, two days after a serious snowmobile accident.

The accident on Sunday forced Sarah Palin to cut short a campaign trip for Donald Trump, the front-runner in the race for the Republican Partys presidential nomination. Palin, who has endorsed Trump, had been scheduled to campaign for him on Monday in The Villages, a central Florida retirement community of more than 100,000 residents which has its own newspaper and radio station.  Florida is one of five states holding nominating contests on Tuesday for the Nov. 8 general election. Trump campaign officials said Palin, 52, was returning to Alaska to be with her husband and they looked forward to her return to the campaign trail soon. Sarah Palin was Republican Senator John McCains running mate in the 2008 presidential election won by Democrat Barack Obama. ",politicsNews,"March 15, 2016 ",1
U.S. hopes easing limits on Cuba will boost reform in Havana: officials,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States hopes a new package of U.S. regulatory changes affecting Cuba will encourage people-to-people interactions and provide additional incentives for Havana to make economic and trade reforms of its own, U.S. officials said on Tuesday. The regulatory reforms, which were introduced earlier on Tuesday, loosen travel restrictions on Cuba and ease limits on the use of U.S. dollars in trade transactions there just days ahead of President Barack Obamas historic visit to the former Cold War enemy. U.S. officials told reporters the new rules would allow more Cubans to work legally in the United States without having to defect, but they declined to predict how that might affect Major League Baseball. It certainly does address the ability of Cuban athletes who can earn salaries in the United States to do so, one official told reporters in a briefing. ",politicsNews,"March 15, 2016 ",1
Republican Party gears up to fight Obama court nominee,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican Party on Monday stepped up its fight against any Supreme Court nominee put forward by President Barack Obama while the presidents allies hit back against a conservative groups attack on a judge who had been considered for the job. The Republican Partys move to create a task force to coordinate advertising and other steps to assail Obamas nominee to fill the vacancy left by the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia is the latest indication that the political fight could become very nasty. Its clear what Republicans are planning to do, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. They are planning to tear down the presidents nominee, without regard to who that person is. The Republican National Committee said the task force will contract and team up with America Rising Squared, a conservative group, in the effort. This will be the most comprehensive judicial response effort in our partys history, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement. If the president wants to break with decades of precedent by pushing through a nominee in an election year, were going to vet that person and put their real record on display, Priebus said. Earnest declined to say when Obama would announce his choice to fill the vacancy, beyond saying it would not be on Monday. The Republicans who control the Senate have vowed not to hold confirmation hearings or an up-or-down vote on anyone Obama picks, saying the choice should belong to the next president who takes office in January after the Nov. 8 presidential election. The nomination requires Senate confirmation. The stakes are high, as Obamas selection could pivot the nine-member court to the left for the first time in decades. In an interview with CNN Espanol that aired on Monday, Obama said he will make his decision soon. He said he is looking for someone with impeccable credentials who should be a consensus candidate. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid denounced on the Senate floor what he called a smear campaign against federal appeals court judge Jane Kelly, who had been on Obamas short list of potential nominees. Sources familiar with the selection process said on Friday Kelly was not among the final three under consideration, federal appeals court judges Sri Srinivasan, Merrick Garland and Paul Watford. Reid was referring to an ad campaign mounted by a conservative activist group called the Judicial Crisis Network referring to Kelly as a a liberal extremist with a disturbing background. It cited her prior work as a public defender in Iowa for a man charged with possessing child pornography who was later convicted of first-degree murder and sexual assault in the death of his former girlfriends 5-year-old daughter. The group, in a news release, called the ads the next phase of its national campaign to educate and inform the public about whats at stake in filling the Supreme Court vacancy. Reid referred to the group as a dark money, right-wing political organization that operates in total secrecy. The accusations leveled against Judge Kelly are despicable, Reid said, calling on Iowas U.S. senators including Republican Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee who in the past praised Kelly, to denounce to the groups charges. The Senate voted to confirm Kelly to her current position in 2013 in a 96-0 vote. Obama administration lawyers continued to review the legal opinions of three finalists, weighing whether elements could become a flashpoint for opponents on the right or even the left. The current finalists generally are considered more moderate than liberals in the tradition of Obamas two previous appointments, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.  ",politicsNews,"March 14, 2016 ",1
Reforms aimed at making Pentagon acquisition more agile: House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry  introduced a second batch of legislative proposals on Tuesday aimed at speeding up how the Pentagon buys weapons and making it easier for firms to retain their intellectual property. Thornberrys legislation follows an initial batch of reforms enacted last year with the 2016 annual defense policy bill, and continues efforts to make weapons programs more transparent. The proposals are aimed at simplifying the convoluted U.S. Defense Department acquisition process, with a big push to fund more experimentation and prototyping of new weapons, while driving to get new technologies into the hands of troops faster. Many big weapons programs are over budget and behind schedule, although Pentagon officials say changes undertaken since 2009 are starting to have a positive impact. The new legislation aims to shorten the time it takes from the start of the design phase of a new program until a military service can start using a new weapon in combat to five-to-six years from around nine year currently, the staff said. The bill requires all weapons systems to have open systems architectures that will allow the services to hold competitions for more components, and carry out quicker upgrades as new technologies are developed. It authorizes the Air Force, Army and other military services to use certain funding to pay for prototype upgrades of components and to develop technology faster. The bill also seeks to end a controversy about how the Pentagon treats private companies intellectual property that has made non-traditional suppliers reluctant to do business with the U.S. military and its complex defense acquisition rules. Instead of automatically giving the government broad rights to control intellectual property rights that are jointly funded by industry and government, the bill would mandate that such arrangements would have to be negotiated between the parties. The legislation would also continue a push to make the military services more responsible and accountable for weapons programs, requiring them to begin overseeing milestone decisions for joint programs after Oct. 1, 2019. The bill also requires the secretary of defense, or his staff, to fix the costs and expected fielding date for new weapons programs, and then hold the services accountable for meeting those targets. To ensure more transparency, the bill also calls for creation of an acquisition scorecard that would compare program cost estimates with those submitted by independent estimators.

Lawmakers see strong board as part of Puerto Rico debt fix,"SAN JUAN/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers are writing a fix to the Puerto Rico debt crisis that would give an independent financial review board sweeping power to arbitrate creditor disputes and map a future for the U.S. territorys pension system. Rather than pick winners and losers among investors who hold roughly $70 billion of Puerto Rican debt, the Republican plan envisions leaving key questions to a newly-created board, according to legislative sources familiar with the work.  Republicans control both houses of Congress and so the party leaders often write the first draft of legislation. Under the proposal, White House and congressional leaders would appoint a board of financial experts to arbitrate politically-charged questions like whether bonds issued by utilities or even the islands government should be written down.  We expect to have a framework that protects taxpayers and restores solvency to the island, said Parish Braden, spokesman for the Natural Resources Committee that is writing legislation in the House of Representatives. A crucial issue for lawmakers is whether Puerto Rico will have a clear path to restructure debt through the courts, in a process akin to U.S. bankruptcy, if the new board could not facilitate a deal among stakeholders. The U.S. Treasury Department has long called for a debt restructuring for Puerto Rico. So have Congressional Democrats, and Puerto Ricos leaders. A spokesman for the Treasury Department said officials were encouraged by the increased legislative activity, but declined to speculate on the Republican legislation that was expected to be finished before the end of the month. And while Republicans will write the first draft of the rescue bill, Democrats in Congress and the White House will have a say as legislation moves toward approval from President Barack Obama. On Monday, New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat, proposed putting roughly $45 billion in unfunded pension liabilities at the top of the list of creditors. Some creditors are concerned where they might rank with such a move and many oppose any provision that would allow the island to file for bankruptcy. Municipal bond markets would be roiled if Puerto Rico were cleared, some Republican lawmakers have argued.  These are complicated issues and Congress needs to empower people qualified to handle them, said one staffer working on the plan. The 3.5 million residents of Puerto Rico may face a reduction of essential government services like public safety and health care if there is no fix before the next debt payments in May, Puerto Rico Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla told Congress last year. The Menendez plan would restructure all of Puerto Ricos debt, establishing a chief financial officer, a Fiscal Stability and Reform Board and require the islands governor to develop a 5-year fiscal plan. If Puerto Rico accepts the plan Menendez proposes then an automatic 12-month stay on debt payments would go into effect, after which a restructuring plan with creditors would be crafted. The plan would see that pensions would be paid before the  islands General Obligation debt, which is typically the first in line for payment. Padilla praised Menendezs plan for providing tools needed to stave off the immediate impact of the crisis while helping to stabilize the economy. Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who is chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, swatted away Menendezs proposals. While I have yet to see the full legislative text of the proposals, from what Ive read, Senate Democrats appear to want to move the goal posts on broad debt restructuring, Hatch said in a statement emailed to Reuters.

Obama predicts Congress will lift Cuba embargo under next president: CNN,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama believes Congress will lift an embargo on Cuba under the next president, whether a Republican or a Democrat, he said in an interview with CNN Espanol that was broadcast on Monday. Obama, who will make a historic trip to Cuba next week, said there was not enough support among lawmakers to lift the embargo now, but sentiment was moving in that direction in both parties. My strong prediction is that sometime in the next presidents administration, whether they are a Democrat or a Republican, that the embargo in fact will be removed, he said in the interview, according to a transcript.  The interview was conducted last week. It makes sense for us to be able to sell into Cuba, to do business with Cubans, to show us business practices and how we treat workers and how we approach issues of human rights, that will help bring about the kinds of changes that are needed, he said. Obama leaves office next January.  ",politicsNews,"March 14, 2016 ",1
Obama's prisoner clemency plan faltering as cases pile up,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In April 2014, the administration of President Barack Obama announced the most ambitious clemency program in 40 years, inviting thousands of jailed drug offenders and other convicts to seek early release and urging lawyers across the country to take on their cases. Nearly two years later the program is struggling under a deluge of unprocessed cases, sparking concern within the administration and among justice reform advocates over the fate of what was meant to be legacy-defining achievement for Obama. More than 8,000 cases out of more than 44,000 federal inmates who applied have yet to make it to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for review, lawyers involved in the program told Reuters. That is in addition to about 9,000 cases that are still pending at the DOJ, according to the departments own figures. Only 187 inmates have had their sentences commuted, far below the thousands expected by justice reform advocates and a tiny fraction of the 2.2 million people behind bars in the United States, which has the worlds highest incarceration rate. The administration said it wanted to decide on all the applications before Obamas term ends next January, when the program will automatically expire.  A senior DOJ official told Reuters it is calling on the lawyers group  Clemency Project 2014  to simply hand over the outstanding cases without further vetting, saying it is not working fast enough. So far, the group estimates it has handed over around 200 cases. But criminal justice experts say the administration itself should bear much of the blame. The idea to tap pro-bono attorneys to help vet the cases originated with the DOJ, and critics say it should have prepared its own staff to handle the large volume of applications. Its unfair to criticize the volunteer group that you asked to help, said Rachel Barkow, a criminal law professor at New York University who has studied clemency in U.S. prisons. She estimates that about 1,500 prisoners should be eligible for commutation, saying the 187 granted so far does not fulfill the promise of the program.  The DOJ declined to comment when asked for its response to such criticism. The delays have left prisoners like Linda Byrnes, 69, in limbo. I thought clemency was for people like me, Byrnes told Reuters through an electronic messaging system from a federal prison in Alderson, West Virginia. Byrnes, who has spent 20 years in prison for distributing marijuana and has two years left on her sentence, was recently diagnosed with mouth cancer and has yet to hear whether she has been assigned a lawyer after submitting her application to Clemency Project in August 2014. Obama, who has commuted more sentences than the past five presidents combined, has been a stern critic of harsh U.S. sentencing policies that he says have disproportionately burdened minorities. Federal life sentences have fallen since Obama took office, from 280 in fiscal year 2009 to 153 in 2013, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission. About three quarters of the sentences were given to minorities and most were for non-violent offences, the report said. Clemency Project 2014 said it does not comment publicly on the individuals it represents. The group vets the applications, writes the petitions and sends them to the Justice Departments Office of the Pardon Attorney, which oversees all pardons and sentence commutations and makes recommendations for the presidents approval.  So far, 25,000 of 34,000 applications received by Clemency Project have been rejected for failing to meet the basic criteria - no record of violence, no significant ties to a gang or drug cartel, good behavior in prison and completion of at least 10 years of sentence. About 10,000 inmates did not go through the Clemency Project and either applied directly to DOJ or through a paid attorney. It really would be a sad state of affairs if individuals who had asked for a lawyer werent considered in time because their petitions never reached the pardon attorneys office, a DOJ official told Reuters on the condition of anonymity. (Graphic on the clemency bottleneck: tmsnrt.rs/1VThxVT) A large number of mostly unqualified applications, a shortage of lawyers and the complexity of the cases have slowed progress, said Cynthia Roseberry, project manager for Clemency Project 2014. There are a lot of gray areas, said Roseberry, who estimates it takes 30 days for one lawyer to review one case on average. Weve got to unpack each of these applicants to see specifically what factors affect them... and so that takes a little more time. This includes finding pre-sentencing reports for each case, determining if the person would have received a shorter sentence under current law and reviewing prison behavior records. Roseberry said the group was unaware of any request from the Justice Department to hand over the pending applications. Roseberry said the groups initially slow pace has picked up in recent months. The Justice Department declined to elaborate on its private communication with the lawyers. The Pardon Attorneys office has brought in personnel from other parts of the department to help to speed up reviews of petitions, the DOJ official said. Roseberry said about 3,000 applicants still need to be assigned to a lawyer, and that it was not certain whether the group will be able to submit all of the applications it has received before Obama leaves office.  The group has more than 570 law firms and 30 law schools contributing to the effort. Some rejected prisoners and those who have yet to hear a decision say they believe they would have had a better chance if they had sent their clemency petition directly to the government. Josie Ledezma was sentenced to life for conspiracy to transport cocaine and applied for clemency through Clemency Project 2014. She said she did not hear from them for six months and later learned that her assigned lawyer had shut down her legal practice. In January, nearly one year after applying, she was told Clemency Project 2014 could not help her and encouraged her to apply directly. I wrote back and asked what was it that made me not qualify, but never got a response, Ledezma told Reuters through an electronic messaging service for federal prisoners.

SEC approves budget of independent accounting board,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday approved the budget for the auditing watchdog that oversees the work of leading U.S. accounting firms. The SEC staff recommended approving the budget of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and SEC Commission Chair Mary Jo White and Commissioner Kara Stein endorsed the $257.7 million budget. Commissioner Michael S. Piwowar voted against, saying he was skeptical of the nearly 3 percent increase in the PCAOB budget from a year ago. He also said he was not persuaded that the additional burden on accounting firms and broker-dealers, which fund the PCAOB through fees, was merited. The Commission represents the only safeguard to an otherwise unilateral ability to impose the accounting support fee on companies and broker-dealers, said. The SEC controls the budget and assigns members of the PCAOB, which was conceived to prevent future accounting scandals like the one that brought down energy company Enron in 2001. The SEC has two vacant seats and the Senate Banking Committee is due on Tuesday to consider two nominees put forward by the White House. Commission Chair Mary Jo White has said she intends to wait until the agency once again has its full, five-member panel before moving forward to appoint a new PCAOB chief. Current PCAOB Chairman James Dotys term expired last fall. ",politicsNews,"March 14, 2016 ",1

Her campaign said Clinton will tell supporters she will take a stand against weak rules of origin and will say the pending Trans Pacific Partnership, a trade compact with 12 nations, is not stringent enough. The TPP, which is being finalized by the Obama administration, sets the content threshold for made in America cars at 45 percent.

Trump says accepts no responsibility for campaign protesters,"WASHINGTON/BLOOMINGTON, Ill. (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump refused to take responsibility on Sunday for clashes at his campaign events and criticized protesters who have dogged his rallies and forced him to cancel one in Chicago last week. When a protester interrupted his speech on Sunday at an airport hangar in Bloomington, Illinois, minutes after it began, Trump derided him as a disrupter and told the cheering crowd: Dont worry about it - I dont hear their voice.  Our rallies are so big and we have so many people, I never hear their voices. I only hear our peoples voices saying: There they are, there they are, the billionaire businessman said as the audience roared approval and some 2,000 protesters waited outside. Two later rallies on Sunday in Ohio and Florida passed without disruption. Trump is trying to cement his lead over his remaining Republican rivals - U.S. Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida and Ohio Governor John Kasich - in five states that hold presidential nominating contests on Tuesday for Republicans and Democrats: Florida, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri. The four Republicans and Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are vying to run in the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. Trump used a round of Sunday morning television appearances to rebut strong criticism from Republican rivals and Democrats that he was encouraging discord with divisive language disparaging Muslims and illegal immigrants. I dont accept responsibility. I do not condone violence in any shape, Trump said on NBCs Meet the Press.  The 69-year-old New York real estate mogul defended his supporters and said he was considering helping pay the legal fees of a 78-year-old white man who punched a young black man at a Trump rally in North Carolina last week. The man, Trump said, got carried away.  Ive actually instructed my people to look into it, he said. The man, John McGraw, was charged with assault and later with communicating a threat after he was seen on video saying he enjoyed hitting that loudmouth and threatening next time to kill him. Trump had earlier promised to help cover the legal fees of supporters involved in clashes at his rallies. On Friday night, thousands of protesters, many of them telling journalists they were Sanders or Clinton supporters, showed up at the Chicago rally, forcing Trump to cancel the event and casting a shadow over his weekend rallies. Trump drew condemnation from his rivals. We are now seeing images on television that we havent seen in this country since the 1960s, images that make us look like a Third World country, Rubio, 44, said at a campaign event in The Villages, a retirement community in Florida. Do we really want to live in a country where Americans hate each other? Clinton, the Democratic front-runner and former U.S. secretary of state, said Trump was incredibly bigoted and pitting Americans against each other. He is trafficking in hate and fear, she told CNN. He is playing to our worst instincts.  Trump said tension at his rallies came from people being sick and tired of American leadership that has cost them jobs through trade deals, failed to defeat Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, and treated military veterans poorly. The people are angry at that - theyre not angry about something Im saying, he said. Im just the messenger. Trump has harnessed the discontent of white, working-class voters who blame trade deals for costing them jobs. He has proposed building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border,  disparaged some Mexican immigrants as criminals and advocated a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. A few dozen protesters, mostly young, stood in the rain outside a later Trump rally on Sunday in West Chester, Ohio, near Cincinnati.  Alexander Shelton, a 26-year-old student and activist, wore a white Muslim prayer robe with a picture of the civil rights leader Malcolm X painted on front. We have to stand up against white supremacy, he said. Trump stands for that.  Michael McKinney, 47, a self-employed credit-card processor from Ohio, came to the rally with his wife and young daughter, and blamed the protesters for the violence. If the protesters dont act civilly, people on the edge are going to snap, he said. We are not a Third World nation. We dont stand for killing each other because we disagree or even harm each other, he said. This isnt the United States I grew up in.

Trump without the hair? EU's migration policy gets rough,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europes emerging migration policy is looking increasingly like Donald Trump without the hair. Except that, unlike the Republican presidential frontrunner, who wants to make Mexico pay for a wall to keep migrants out of the United States, the Europeans are willing to pay their neighbor Turkey to do the job for them. Seven months and a million migrants after Chancellor Angela Merkel declared a welcome culture for Syrian refugees in Germany, the European Union is rushing to erect No vacancy signs along its internal and external borders. Under fierce political pressure in her own conservative camp and from an insurgent right-wing populist party, the Alliance for Germany (AfD), Merkels mantra of We can do this is morphing into The Turks can do this for us.      In a surprise overnight deal she negotiated with Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu last week, Ankara offered to take back all migrants, including Syrian refugees, who cross from its shores into Europe from now on or are intercepted off its coast. Having thus sealed its most porous border to irregular migrants, the EU would admit a limited number of carefully vetted Syrian refugees directly from Turkey - one for each Syrian asylum seeker Ankara took back from Greek Aegean islands. The lucky few would be chosen with the help of the U.N. refugee agency from among those who had waited patiently in camps in Syrias neighbors, not those who had paid smugglers thousands of euros for a risky sea crossing. They would be sent to those EU countries that agreed last year to take in a quota, although some states are resisting that. Stifling doubts about the legality of such a blanket return policy, discomfort at outsourcing it to a partner many of them see as worryingly authoritarian, and irritation at the price Turkey is demanding, stunned EU leaders gave their provisional assent. European public opinion is so petrified by images of tens of thousands of bedraggled migrants trekking across muddy fields and highways towards western and northern Europe - and populists have made such capital out of those fears - that governments are desperate to halt the flow. Another summit in Brussels this week is due to conclude the Faustian bargain, granting Turkey 6 billion euros ($6.7 billion)in aid to keep refugees on its soil, an accelerated path to visa-free travel for Turks and faster EU membership talks in return for its agreement to act as Europes gatekeeper. European Council President Donald Tusk says regaining control of Europes external borders is a condition for gaining public acceptance to take in refugees. In practice, it looks more like a way of keeping them out, if it can be implemented. Human rights groups and volunteers who work with refugees are outraged to see Europe slamming shut its open door for victims of war and persecution.   EU lawyers are working overtime to try to make it legal. The Geneva Convention on refugees requires signatories to examine individually each claim for protection submitted by an asylum seeker on their soil. The German-Turkish deal would get around that provision by declaring Turkey a safe third country to which irregular migrants could be returned under a bilateral Greek-Turkish readmission agreement.  The United Nations top human rights official has said that could entail illegal collective and arbitrary expulsions. Apart from the moral issues raised by this dodge, there are several legal problems. Turkey restricts its application of the Geneva Convention to refugees from Europe. People fleeing war or persecution in the Middle East and Asia will not be covered unless Ankara amends its laws. Turkish officials say they will ensure Turkey complies with international law to fulfill its part of the potential EU deal. Even so, lawyers say asylum seekers who reach Greece have a right to appeal against being sent back to Turkey if they fear for their personal safety there. A Greek court would have to hear each appeal before a person could be removed. There is no appropriate court on the Greek islands, and Greek justice is notoriously slow. At the same time, the rush to declare Turkey safe could hardly have come at a more embarrassing time for the EU. President Tayyip Erdogan has stepped up a military crackdown on Kurdish militants, the government has seized Turkeys best-selling newspaper, critical journalists face prosecution and jail, and businessmen and public officials close to a dissident Muslim cleric have been purged.  Unlike Trump, most EU leaders do not declare they want to prevent more Muslims settling in their country, with the exception of Hungarys Viktor Orban and Slovakias Robert Fico, who have stressed preserving their countries Christian identity. However, anti-immigration campaigners like Marine Le Pen in France and Geert Wilders in the Netherlands openly cite Islam as a reason for rejecting refugees, and they are increasingly setting the agenda for mainstream politicians. They oppose visa-free travel for Turks in Europe for the same reason. France, which has a tradition of political asylum and took in tens of thousands of Vietnamese boat people in the 1970s, is limiting its intake of Syrian refugees now, citing security concerns following last years Islamist attacks in Paris. Like other west European countries, France has struggled to integrate second and third generation young people of Muslim or north African origin. The place of Islam in public life is fiercely contested in these secular societies, and resentments from Algerias war of independence still simmer. European politicians may be aghast at the rhetoric of Trump, who has said he wants a database to register and track Muslims in the United States and would bar any Muslim entering the country until Congress could act. But if the pact with Turkey goes through as conceived, the EU will be retreating into a fortress Europe policy for fear of its own Trumps.

New disturbance at Trump rally as crucial Republican contests near,"DAYTON, Ohio (Reuters) - Secret Service officers rushed on stage to protect U.S. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump during a disturbance at a rally on Saturday, a day after rowdy protests shut down his event in Chicago. Trump briefly ducked at the podium and four Secret Service members scrambled to surround him after a man charged the stage at Dayton International Airport in Ohio.  Officers then grabbed the man, dressed in a black T-shirt and jeans, before he was able to reach the stage and hauled him away.  I was ready. I dont know if I would have done well but I would have been out there fighting, folks, Trump told a rally later in the day. He said the man was looking to do harm.  The incident further increased tension after Trumps Chicago rally was scrapped amid chaotic scenes on Friday. Trumps Republican rivals hurled scorn at the New York billionaire, saying he helped create the nervous atmosphere that is now sweeping the race for the White House with his fiery rhetoric.  Trump blamed supporters of Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders for the incidents in Chicago, where scuffles broke out between protesters and backers of the real estate magnate. He called the U.S. senator from Vermont our communist friend. The scenes in Chicago followed a series of recent incidents of violence at Trump rallies, in which protesters and journalists have been punched, tackled and hustled out of venues, raising concerns about degrading security leading into the Nov. 8 election. All of a sudden a planned attack just came out of nowhere, Trump said in Dayton, describing the events in Chicago. He called the protest leaders there professional people.     Sanders, a U.S. Senator from Vermont, hit back. As is the case virtually every day, Donald Trump is showing the American people that he is a pathological liar. Obviously, while I appreciate that we had supporters at Trumps rally in Chicago, our campaign did not organize the protests. President Barack Obama told a fundraising event in Dallas  that political leaders should be trying to bring us together and not turning us against one another. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton drew criticism for releasing an initial statement that did not mention Trump by name and tied violent campaign events to a shooting in a South Carolina black church last year that left 9 people dead. While campaigning in St. Louis, Missouri, on Saturday, Clinton criticized Trump directly for ugly, divisive rhetoric that encourages aggression and violence. The months-long Republican race may be coming to a head at nominating contests on Tuesday where Trump is seeking victories that might give him an almost insurmountable lead for the nomination.  Primaries in Florida and Ohio will be particularly important since they are winner-take-all states, where all Republican delegates are given to the winner of the popular vote instead of being awarded proportionally. It will be a make-or-break day for Republican candidates John Kasich, the governor of Ohio, and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who both must win their home states to forge a credible path forward. Trump has drawn fervent support as well as criticism for his calls to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and to impose a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country.  His rallies often attract small groups of protesters, but Fridays was the first at which there may have been as many protesters as supporters. At an event in Kansas City on Saturday, Trump urged police to arrest people who disrupt his events. Theyll have to explain to Mom and Dad why they have a police record and why they cant get a job. And you know what? Im going to start pressing charges against all these people and then we wont have a problem, he said to cheers. Outside the rally, police broke up confrontations between Trump supporters and protesters who shouted, Shut it down!  Police on horseback and riot gear briefly moved into a crowd of protesters and officers used what appeared to be pepper spray against demonstrators for a few seconds. Rubio, who according to the New York Times slightly edged out Kasich on Saturday to win the Washington D.C. primary with 37 percent of the vote, bemoaned the state of the presidential race during an event in Florida, saying it had become reality television. Last night in Chicago, we saw images that make America look like a Third World country, Rubio said, reminding supporters the stakes on Tuesday are high. Kasich told journalists before a campaign event in Cincinnati, Ohio, that Trump had created a toxic environment.  Republican candidate U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas called the Chicago incidents sad. Vanderbilt University political scientist John Geer said that the tension on display at Trumps events are a proxy for what is going on in the electorate writ large. People have strong reactions to Donald Trump, Geer said. They are playing out in the voting booth and they are also playing out at these events. Geer said the Chicago cancellation would likely embolden Trumps supporters - an idea floated by Trump in several television interviews.

White House narrows search to three for Supreme Court,"WASHINGTON/AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - The White House has narrowed its search for a U.S. Supreme Court nominee to three federal appeals court judges, Sri Srinivasan, Merrick Garland and Paul Watford, a source familiar with the selection process said on Friday. Srinivasan, an Indian-American who served under presidents of both parties before President Barack Obama named him as an appellate judge, and Garland, considered but passed over for the Supreme Court twice before by Obama, are considered the leading contenders, according to the source and two other sources close to the process. Obama is searching for a replacement for long-serving conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13. Senate Republicans have vowed not to hold confirmation hearings or an up-or-down vote on any nominee picked by the Democratic president for the lifetime position on the court. Senate Republicans, hoping a candidate from their party wins the Nov. 8 presidential election, want the next president, who takes office in January, to make the selection.  A formal announcement could come as soon as Monday. That would give Obama the weekend to think about his final choice and make an announcement before Tuesdays presidential primary elections in five states including Florida and Ohio. Srinivasan, 49, and Garland, 63, serve together on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That appeals court has served as a springboard to the Supreme Court for several justices including Scalia in recent decades. Srinivasan, who was born in India and grew up in Kansas, would be the first Asian-American and first Hindu on the high court. Obama appointed him to the appeals court in 2013. The Senate confirmed him in a 97-0 vote. Srinivasan served in the Justice Department under Democratic and Republican presidents and worked as a clerk to the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court, Sandra Day OConnor, a Republican appointee. Garland, who has earned praise from lawmakers of both parties, is the chief judge of the Washington appeals court, where he has served since being appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1997, winning confirmation in a 76-23 vote. Prior to that, he served in the Justice Department under Clinton. Watford, 48, is a judge on the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, winning Senate confirmation in a 61-34 vote in 2012. He previously worked as a prosecutor and in private practice. If confirmed, he would be the nations third black justice, following current justice Clarence Thomas, appointed in 1991, and Thurgood Marshall, who retired in 1991 and died in 1993. Obama is the first black U.S. president. It was unclear whether the other two other candidates who had been expected to be interviewed by Obama, federal appeals court judge Jane Kelly and federal trial judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, were now out of the running altogether. Kelly is a judge on the St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Jackson is a federal trial judge in Washington. Both were appointed to those positions by Obama. Without Scalia, the Supreme Court is evenly split with four liberals and four conservatives. An Obama appointment could tilt the court to the left for the first time in decades. Obama is traveling in Texas, where he spoke at Austins South by Southwest festival on Friday and is appearing at Democratic fundraisers. He returns to Washington late on Saturday.

Nancy Reagan remembered at funeral for fierce loyalty to husband,"SIMI VALLEY, Calif. (Reuters) - First lady Michelle Obama and representatives from nine former presidential families led a bipartisan gathering of politicians and celebrities in paying memorial tribute to Nancy Reagan, whose love for her late husband, Ronald Reagan, was hailed as a romance for the ages. In an invitation-only funeral for about 1,000 guests to her husbands presidential library in Southern California, the onetime Hollywood actress turned first lady was remembered for the fierce devotion she accorded her spouse during their White House years and his long struggle with Alzheimers disease. Theirs was a love story for the ages, former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said of the couple, during a service that organizers say Nancy Reagan herself helped plan in advance. They had style, they had grace and they had class. Former White House chief of staff James Baker called Nancy Reagan the consummate political wife and first lady, and a figure whose support, encouragement and political savvy were indispensable to her husbands political success. After her husbands death at age 93 in 2004, she dedicated herself to his memory and his place in history, Baker said.  The funeral brought together prominent Republicans and Democrats alike in salute of a woman especially admired by political conservatives at a time when deep partisan rancor has reverberated through Washington and the 2016 presidential campaign. The list of VIPs attending the memorial was headed by President Barack Obamas wife, who sat beside former President George W. Bush and his spouse, Laura, and two fellow former first ladies - Jimmy Carters wife, Rosalynn, and the Democratic front-runner in the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton. Seated nearby were the Reagans daughter Patti Davis and son Ron Jr., - both of whom eulogized their mother - along with Caroline Kennedy, daughter of the late President John Kennedy, and children of his three immediate successors - Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.     Davis described her mother and father as two halves of a circle, closed tight while her brother, Ron, said that as a couple, they were more than the sum of their parts. She was to the president, Baker recalled, absolutely without a doubt his closest advisor, adding she was particularly adept at knowing who was truly loyal to her spouse and who was not. He credited Nancy Reagan with prodding her husband to open a dialogue with then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, a relationship that helped ease Cold War tensions. She could be tough as a Marine drill sergeant ... when things werent going well, Baker said, recounting he only saw Nancy Reagan lose her cool once - the day in March 1980 when her husband was wounded by gunfire from a would-be assassin. She was devastated, and in fact, she fell apart, he said, adding that she returned with her husband to the White House after his discharge from the hospital with a fierce determination to protect him in every way she possibly could. Rain began to fall over the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, north of Los Angeles, as the service ended and a military honor guard carried the flower-bedecked mahogany casket from the memorial gathering beneath a large white tent to a nearby grave site on the grounds.  Nancy Reagan, who died on Sunday of congestive heart failure at age 94 [nL1N16E06K], was to be buried beside her husband later on Friday, though no family members planned to attend, having already said their goodbyes, according to library spokeswoman Melissa Giller. Others dignitaries among the funeral guests were broadcast journalists Diane Sawyer and Tom Brokaw, California Governor Jerry Brown, former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, U.S. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich, as well as such showbiz figures as Oscar-winning actress Anjelica Huston and singer Wayne Newton. Even the actor known as Mr. T, a well-known supporter of Nancy Reagans Just Say No anti-drug campaign, was in attendance, wearing an American flag bandanna on his head.

EU's Schulz wouldn't favor a Trump White House,"PARIS (Reuters) - European Parliament President Martin Schulz said on Saturday that neither Europe nor the United States was prepared for a Donald Trump presidency as the likely Republican candidate had no international experience and was a populist. Trump belongs to these people that we also have here in Europe, who have a scapegoat for all issues but never have a concrete solution, Schulz told French television i-Tele. Honestly, I prefer another candidate, he said, referring to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, a former U.S. Secretary of State.  Schulz, a German Social Democrat, is president  or speaker  of the European Unions directly elected parliament, whose 751 members have the power to approve, amend or reject legislation affecting the whole 28-country bloc.  Billionaire Trump has a significant lead in primary contests for the Republican nomination for Novembers election to the White House. He has drawn fervent support as well as harsh criticism for his calls to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and to impose a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. A Trump rally scheduled for Friday night in Chicago was canceled after the event turned into a chaotic scene, with thousands of attendees split into opposing camps of his supporters and protesters inflamed by his candidacy.

"Aiming to sidestep Apple dispute, Obama makes case for access to device data","AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday made a passionate case for mobile devices to be built in a way that would allow the government to gain access to personal data if needed to prevent a terrorist attack or enforce tax laws. Speaking at the South by Southwest festival in Texas, the president said he could not comment on the legal case in which the Federal Bureau of Investigation is trying to force Apple Inc. to allow access to an iPhone linked to San Bernardino, California, shooter Rizwan Farook. But he made clear that despite his commitment to Americans privacy and civil liberties, a balance was needed to allow some government intrusion if necessary.  If technologically it is possible to make an impenetrable device or system where the encryption is so strong that there is no key, theres no door at all, then how do we apprehend the child pornographer, how do we solve or disrupt a terrorist plot? he said. What mechanisms do we have available to even do simple things like tax enforcement because if in fact you cant crack that at all, government cant get in, then everybody is walking around with a Swiss bank account in their pocket. Last month, the FBI obtained a court order requiring Apple to write new software and take other measures to disable passcode protection and allow access to Farooks iPhone. Apple, which declined to comment on Obamas remarks on Friday, has not complied. It said the government request would create a back door to phones that could be abused by criminals and governments, and that Congress has not given the Justice Department authority to make such a demand. Obamas comments were his most expansive on the subject since the dispute. He acknowledged skepticism about the government in the wake of the revelations about U.S. surveillance programs by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. But he pressed his point that a compromise that respected civil liberties and protected security had to be found. That solution would likely be a system with strong encryption and a secure key that is accessible to the smallest number of people possible for issues that were agreed to be important. Setting aside the specific case between the FBI and Apple ... were going to have to make some decisions about how do we balance these respective risks, Obama said. My conclusion so far is you cannot take an absolutist view. Adding to his argument, the president listed airport security and stops for drunk drivers as examples of measures that were intrusive but accepted. He also warned against fetishizing phones. This notion that somehow our data is different and can be walled off from those other tradeoffs we make I believe is incorrect, he said. Top White House officials have lobbied the industry aggressively to work with the government on the issue, which was brought to a head by the California shootings. The FBI says Farook and his wife were inspired by Islamist militants when they shot and killed 14 people on Dec. 2 at a holiday party in California. The couple later died in a shootout with police.

"Trump snags former rival's backing, scraps Chicago rally","CHICAGO/PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump canceled a campaign rally Friday night amid security concerns just hours after the Republican front-runner earned the endorsement of a former rival who said the billionaires pugnacious campaign style is belied by a more thoughtful, private side. There are two different Donald Trumps: theres the one you see on the stage and theres the one whos very cerebral, sits there and considers things very carefully, Ben Carson said Friday as he became the second former Republican candidate to back Trump in the White House race. The soft-spoken retired neurosurgeon, who dropped out of the race last week, said the American people would be comforted when they discover Trumps gentler side. The thousands of protesters who showed up for Trumps rally Friday evening at the University of Illinois at Chicago - along with thousands of supporters - showed little indication they had noticed anything but the candidates combative campaign style.  The university arena turned into a chaotic scene as the two warring sides amped up their positions. A half hour after the rally was slated to begin, a Trump campaign staffer announced it was being postponed for safety reasons, unleashing competing chants of We dumped Trump! and We want Trump! throughout the packed venue. We made a great decision not to have the rally, Trump told CNN after meeting with law enforcement and making the call. I am not a person that wants to see violence, he added. Trump blamed protesters for creating disturbances at his campaign events and said it is a love fest among his supporters.  Fridays event in Chicago stood out because the huge number of protesters virtually matched the number of Trump supporters, as opposed to other Trump campaign events where protesters have been a very small, albeit vocal, minority. Earlier in the day, speaking at a public event in St. Louis, Missouri, Trump was interrupted repeatedly by protesters who were led out of the event by police and security, an increasingly common occurrence at his raucous rallies. Hes all mouth, get him out, Trump shouted as one of the protesters was led out. Go back to mommy, he said as another protester was led away. The latest endorsement for Trump followed a Republican debate in Miami on Thursday night at which Trump and the remaining three candidates in the Republican race struck a markedly more civil tone.  Carson shot to the top of the Republican pack last year but faltered in the early nominating contests. His endorsement is unlikely to dramatically shift the Republican race, but it gives Trump a boost as the Republican establishment cranks up attacks, and comes just days before crucial nominating contests in the battle to be the partys presidential candidate for the Nov. 8 election. The Republican primaries to be held on Tuesday in five states will be critical for Trump to cement his lead, and to determine whether U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Ohio Governor John Kasich, whose home states are among those holding contests on Tuesday, will be able to continue with their increasingly long-shot candidacies. Trumps nearest rival in the race is U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Carsons comments on Friday aimed to soften Trumps public image after a campaign marked by his demeaning personal attacks on opponents, harsh comments about Mexican immigrants and calls to temporarily bar all Muslims from entering the country. Trumps controversial campaign has led many Republican establishment figures to call for an all-out effort to prevent him from winning the nomination - an effort that Carson said would fracture the Republican Party and ensure a Democratic win in November. Asked about Carsons comments, Trump said he did not want to overanalyze himself but there was only one Donald Trump. Certainly you have all of this, and you have somebody else that sits, and reads and thinks. And Im a thinker, said Trump, 69. Perhaps people dont think of me in that way because you dont see me in that form. Trump also raised the possibility that he will not attend the next Republican debate, scheduled for later this month in Salt Lake City. Weve had enough debates, in my opinion, he said. In St. Louis, Trumps speech was interrupted more than a half-dozen times by protesters. Scuffles between Trump supporters and protesters have become more frequent, and a protester was punched in North Carolina on Wednesday by a Trump  supporter who has been charged with assault. The officers are being very gentle, Trump advised, telling the crowd later, It adds to the flavor, makes it more exciting, isnt this better than listening to a long boring speech? Carsons endorsement of Trump followed that of another former candidate, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who announced his backing last month. Next Tuesdays voting will be a pivotal point as candidates chase the 1,237 delegates from primary contests and caucuses needed to win the Republican nomination. Trump has 459 delegates, followed by Cruz at 360, Rubio at 152 and Kasich at 54, according to the Associated Press. The primaries in Florida and Ohio on Tuesday have the potential to be game-changers because both states award Republican delegates on a winner-take-all basis, meaning that he winner of the popular vote in each state will be awarded the states entire slate of delegates. Many states award delegates proportionate to the popular vote.  For his part, Rubio said in a round of television interviews on Friday he was still in position to win Florida next week. Voters in his home state who do not want Trump as the Republican nominee should support him, he said. If they dont want Donald Trump to be our nominee, then voting for John Kasich or Ted Cruz in Florida is a vote for Donald Trump, Rubio said on ABCs Good Morning America.  Rubio said later that his supporters in Ohio should vote for Kasich next Tuesday if that looked like the best anti-Trump tactic. Clearly John Kasich has a better chance of winning Ohio than I do, and if a voter in Ohio concludes that voting for John Kasich gives us the best chance to stop Donald Trump there, I anticipate that is what they will do, Rubio told reporters at an event in West Palm Beach, Florida.

Trump's Islam comments draw attacks as Republicans discover civility,"MIAMI (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump came under fire from his rivals on Thursday for saying Muslims hate the United States at a debate where the gut-punching attacks of earlier forums gave way to a suddenly civil tone with a serious focus on the issues. Trump, who has voiced skepticism about U.S. military involvement abroad in the past, for the first time said Americas effort against Islamic State militants might require between 20,000 and 30,000 U.S. troops, a number similar to what some Republican hawks have proposed. The CNN-hosted debate at the University of Miami was crucial, coming days before votes in Florida and Ohio that will determine whether U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Ohio Governor John Kasich will be able to continue with their increasingly long-shot candidacies. With previous assaults on Trump having failed to knock him down, Rubio and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas chose a more civil approach, raising questions about Trumps policy positions without attacking him personally. Trump, for his part, used the debate to try to attract establishment Republicans, saying he is generating support from non-Republicans who could help carry the party to victory in the Nov. 8 election. And he eschewed the inflammatory, personal attacks on his rivals that have drawn both cheers and boos in prior debates. The Republican Party has a great chance to embrace millions of people that its never known before. They are coming by the millions. We should seize that opportunity, he said. But he stuck to positions that many establishment Republicans reject, such as his belief, as stated in television interviews, that followers of Islam hate us. We have a serious problem of hate. There is tremendous hate, said Trump, who has proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Rubio, Cruz and Kasich said the United States needs to maintain good relations with Muslim countries in the Middle East to help in the fight against Islamic State militants. We are going to have to work with people in the Muslim faith even as Islam faces a serious crisis within it, Rubio said. Rubio also defended American Muslims as patriots. If you go anywhere in the world youre going see American men and women serving us in uniform that are Muslims, he said.  Anyone out there that has the uniform of the United States on and is willing to die for this country is someone that loves America, he added. Rubio shifted to a more positive tone after his anti-Trump tirades of the past two weeks. But he and Cruz repeatedly sought to raise questions about Trumps policy positions from trade to the Middle East. Cruz pointed to areas where Trump has been a late-comer to the conservative movement, such as his past support for Democratic causes and candidates. He also noted how Trump has asked his supporters at rallies to demonstrate support by raising their right hand, a scene that produced photographs that some critics said looked like Nazi Germany. At Donalds rallies recently hes taken to asking people in the crowd to pledge their support to him. I have to say I think thats exactly backwards. We are here pledging our support to you, not the other way around, Cruz said. Trump, in discussing how he would consider placing between 20,000 to 30,000 U.S. troops on the ground to defeat Islamic State militants, vowed to complete the mission quickly and bring troops home to focus on rebuilding the United States. We really have no choice, we have to knock out ISIS, Trump said. I would listen to the generals, but Im hearing numbers of 20,000 to 30,000. It was the most detailed view yet of Trumps thinking about Islamic State. He has previously talked of knocking the hell out of ISIS without offering specifics. Next Tuesdays Florida and Ohio Republican primaries both award delegates on a winner-take-all basis, meaning that the winner of the popular vote is awarded the states entire slate of delegates. So far, 25 states and Puerto Rico have held nominating contests, and Trump has amassed a solid lead in the delegate race. According to the Associated Press, Trump has 458 delegates, followed by Cruz at 359, Rubio at 151, and Kasich at 54.  Clinching the Republican nomination requires 1,237 delegates. There are a total of 367 delegates at stake on Tuesday, including a total of 165 in Florida and Ohio. Trump on Thursday appeared to try to appear more presidential, something he has pledged often in the past to do so but never has. On Thursday he modulated both the tone of his voice and the tenor of his remarks, which in prior debates have drawn sharp criticism for being vulgar.  I would say this, were all in this together. Were going to come up with solutions, were going to find the answers to things, and so far I cant believe how civil it has been up here, Trump said. The two-hour debate included a sober discussion of pressing foreign and domestic policy challenges, including illegal immigration, reform of Social Security, free trade deals, the role of the federal government in education and Israel.

Ohio's 'dirty little secret': blue-collar Democrats for Trump,"CANTON, Ohio (Reuters) - If Donald Trump wins the Republican Party nomination, his path to the White House will run through this working-class city with a knack for picking presidents. No Republican has ever won the White House without Ohio. And nowhere better reflects the challenges and opportunities Trump faces in his 2016 presidential quest than Canton, a once-booming industrial city that, like Ohio and the rest of Americas rust belt, is going through profound economic and demographic change. Canton, a gritty northeastern Ohio city where the once-dominant steel industry has been in decline for 20 years, is the heart of Stark County, a political bellwether that, save twice, has picked every winning presidential candidate since 1964. The real-estate moguls primary wins in Michigan and in Mississippi on Tuesday, in the face of blistering attacks from the partys establishment, expanded his lead in the White House nominating race and demonstrated his broad appeal across many demographic groups in the Republican Party. But here, in predominately white Canton, the birthplace of professional American football, he will need to show cross-over appeal in the general election and win over not just Republicans but working-class Democrats and some independents, to beat a Democrat, illustrating the challenge he will face in Ohio and potentially other Midwestern rust belt states. A more immediate test looms next week in the states Republican primary, where polls show Trump narrowly leads Ohio Governor John Kasich, who casts himself as a pragmatic, statesman-like alternative to Trump.If Trump wins Ohio and Florida  states rich in the delegates who select their partys nominee at Julys Republican National Convention - he would almost certainly lock up his partys nomination. Sitting in a steel workers meeting at their Canton union hall, Curtis Green, the chapters vice president, described Trumps support among a growing number of members as their dirty little secret.  I view him as a radical and a racist and I dont want to be affiliated with that, Green said. But if you say what you mean, a lot of guys see that in Trump and they respect that. He doesnt dance around the issues, he takes them head on. There are a fair amount of our members who do support Donald Trump. If Trump just wins the states that Republican nominee Mitt Romney won in 2012, he would have only 206 electoral college votes, short of the 270 needed to win the White House. The fight over electoral college votes has turned recent elections into pitched battles over a dozen or so states.  Ohio is often at the center.  The state, which has not voted for the loser in a presidential election since 1960, is seen as a microcosm of American swing voters  from culturally conservative Reagan Democrats who defected from their party to support Republican Ronald Reagan in the 1980s to suburban soccer moms and upwardly mobile Hispanics. To offset the growing proportion of blacks and Hispanics in the voting age population, Trump must turn white voters out in greater numbers than Romney in cities such as Canton. His performance in primary states where Democrats and independent can vote, as well as Republicans, suggests Trump could attract large numbers of these voters in a general election.  Reuters interviews here with more than two dozen voters show why. In this city of 72,500 people, Trumps denunciation of free trade, political correctness and illegal immigrants is resonating among some traditionally Democratic blue-collar steel workers.  The labor unions, who usually support the Democrats, a lot of our members, and a lot of their families, are supporting Trump, said Keith Strobelt, a political director for the United Steelworkers local union in Canton. Strobelt does not support Trump.  Cantons local United Steelworkers union has 1,800 members - down from 6,700 at its peak 30 years ago. Its leadership has not officially endorsed a candidate, thought it has praised Democrat Senator Bernie Sanders. Some rank-and-file members, however, say they better identify with Trumps broadsides against illegal immigration and tirades against trade with China and Mexico. It could be that several hundred of our members will back Trump, Strobelt said. A lot find him refreshing. He says a lot of things they say around their dinner tables. But in a general election, Trump faces formidable odds in Canton, as he does across Ohio and the Midwest. Canton and the region is changing in ways that favor Democrats, reflecting the Republican Partys broader problems with a U.S. electorate that is becoming less white and less culturally conservative. In 2000, Canton was nearly 75 percent white, with an African American population of 20 percent, and an Hispanic population of just over 1 percent. Its biggest employer was the Timken Company, a giant ball bearing and high custom steel manufacturer that was the dominant economic force in Canton for much of the 20th century. By 2010, according to Census data, Canton was 69 percent white. Its black population had increased by 3 percent, its Hispanic residents to nearly 3 percent. Tuesdays primary in neighboring Michigan showed how volatile this election has become, with Trumps potent appeal among disaffected whites stretching beyond the South. In the Democratic race, Sanders won most of the states white working-class countryside and small towns in an upset over front-runner Hillary Clinton. In Canton, like elsewhere in the rust belt heartlands stretching from the Midwest to the Great Lakes region and parts of the Northeast, manufacturing has been hollowed out since the 1970s, due in part to foreign competition. In 1990, Ohio had over 1 million manufacturing jobs; today, just 680,000, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Ohio has shed nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs since the 2007-2009 Great Recession. A different type of worker, more white collar and upscale, has moved into the Canton area.  The top two employers are now the Aultman Hospital and Mercy Medical Center, highly competitive health care providers.  While Trump might pick up blue collar Democrats, and older folks who are disillusioned with the political process, the flip side is he could lose more upper-status voters in Ohio, said John Green, a political science professor at the University of Akron, close to Canton. Republican Party leaders in Ohio are wringing their hands. There is a perception that Trump helps among blue collar voters - but could alienate white collar voters.  Jane Timken, the vice-chair of the Stark County Republican Party and the wife of TimkenSteels chief executive, said the local party was encountering people who had never voted Republican before but were supporting Trump. But, she said, there was concern Trump might turn off other voters, especially independents who account for one fifth of Ohios voters.  There is no polling to predict which way Canton and Stark County will vote in Novembers general election. But after a long era of mixed local government, the city council, after elections last year, is now made up of entirely Democratic Party members, although the current mayor, a former Democrat, won office as an independent. In Canton, there are nearly 6,000 voters registered as Democrats, compared to just over 1,100 Republicans according to the Stark County Board of Elections. In 2006, there were 12,000 registered Democrats and 4,400 Republicans.  Democratic strategists say that despite the demographic changes, Trump could still prevail. Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic strategist, cites Trumps dominant performance in the Republican primary in Massachusetts on March 1. Although not a rust belt state, Trump won big in heavily blue collar, union cities.  Trump put together a coalition in Massachusetts that elects Democratic governors. He won among Catholics, a week after picking a fight with the Pope. I absolutely think he can put the rust belt into play, she said. ",politicsNews,"March 10, 2016 ",1
Mexico's Carstens says 'implicitly' weighing risk of Trump victory,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico central bank governor Agustin Carstens said on Friday he is implicitly factoring in the possibility of Republican hopeful Donald Trump becoming U.S. president in the banks economic risk models. In an interview with El Financiero/Bloomberg Carstens was asked whether the chances of Trump, a persistent critic of the North American Free Trade Agreement, becoming the next president of the United States was in the central banks risk models. Well, explicitly, no, Carstens said. But implicitly all of us have it in our heads, this possibility. Carstens was also asked about Mexican monetary policy in the coming months after the bank launched a surprise rate hike on Feb. 17 to shore up the peso currency, which had been falling sharply against the dollar since the end of 2014. He reiterated that the February move was not the start of a monetary policy tightening cycle, but that the bank would be following moves by the U.S. Federal Reserve closely. Our monetary policy will above all be led by ... the exchange rate, the monetary policy relative to the United States and the inflationary pressures that could occur due to the economic cycle in Mexico, the central bank governor said. Trump, front-runner to win the Republican presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election, sparked outrage in Mexico with campaign vows to slap tariffs on Mexican exports and to build a southern border wall and make Mexico pay for it. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said this month his country would not pay for Trumps proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and likened his strident tone to the ascent of dictators like Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.

Trump's Chicago rally called off for safety reasons amid chaos,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump canceled a rally scheduled for Friday night in Chicago after the event turned into a chaotic scene with thousands of attendees split into opposing camps of supporters of the Republican front-runner and protesters inflamed by his candidacy. A Trump campaign staffer took the stage nearly a half hour after the rally was slated to begin and said it would be postponed for safety reasons. A campaign statement issued slightly later said the event would be held on another unspecified day. Following the announcement, the crowd began to chant and cheer. Scuffles broke out as signs were ripped from hands and police moved in to quickly defuse the most serious scuffles.  Cries of We dumped Trump! We dumped Trump! rose inside the University of Illinois at Chicago pavilion where the event was held. An opposing group yelled: We want Trump! We want Trump!  Outside the pavilion, chants of We shut it down! rippled through the crowd on news of the cancellation. Chicago activists had spent the week leading up to the rally planning how to disrupt it. Trump has become a particularly polarizing candidate in the presidential campaign. He has both inspired impassioned supporters and ignited a backlash of angry dissent with his promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border to keep out illegal immigrants and his call to temporarily ban the entry of Muslims into the country. One group at Fridays event, Showing Up for Racial Justice, coordinated with minority student groups on campuses, using group email chains and messaging so that protesters could stay in constant communication.  One of the organizers, Nathaniel Lewis, 25, a masters degree student in public health at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said he was shocked they succeeded in shutting the rally down. Im happy, Im at peace because we came together as a collective, Lewis told Reuters.  This is the last thing we expected to happen, it shows the power of unity. Trump, speaking to MSNBC by telephone shortly after the canceled event, said he met with law enforcement after arriving in Chicago. Though he believed it would have been possible to move forward, he said he made the wise decision to postpone the rally to keep everyone safe. We were not consulted or involved in the decision to cancel the event, Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told Reuters. Trump brushed off questions from MSNBCs Chris Matthews about whether such widespread disruptions were to be expected given the increasingly aggressive tenor of recent campaign events. Trump said his supporters had planned for a peaceful rally but it was derailed by the crowd of protesters. You cant even have a rally in a major city in this country anymore, Trump said. Up until this point weve had no problem. Trump told MSNBC he expected support for his candidacy would only increase. Earlier in the day, at a rally in St. Louis, Missouri, Trump had been speaking for less than 10 minutes when protesters began interrupting him. The disruptions continued over the next hour as Trump urged security to get them out. Can I be honest with you, it adds to the flavor, its more exciting. Isnt this better than listening to a long boring speech? Trump said of the disruptions. At some events, altercations have turned physical. In New Orleans last week, several protesters supporting the Black Lives Matter movement were dragged out as Trump shouted get them. In Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Wednesday, protesters interrupted Trumps speech more than 16 times. One was punched as he was led from the arena. Jedidiah Brown, 29, dashed onto the Chicago stage where Trump was expected to speak Friday and tore the campaign sign from the podium before police took him outside. He was not arrested. I was born and raised in Chicago so I felt it was my responsibility to let him know hes not welcome here, Brown said. The message Trump is spreading all over the country, it doesnt work here. Outside, Tess King, 25, a social sciences and law student, was carrying a sign that said Chicago Rejects Trump. King had tried to get into the rally but the event was canceled before she got in the door. I feel incredibly happy that in our city we managed, through peaceful expression, to make this happen, King told Reuters. As the crowd began to trickle out, Josh Glaspie, 28, smoked a cigarette on a sidewalk strewn with discarded signs. Glaspie, an Army veteran who is trying to open a restaurant in Chicago, said he supports Trump. Trumps not racist, Glaspie said. These people dont even know why theyre protesting.

Ohio judge rules in favor of 17-year-olds wanting to vote,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - An Ohio judge ruled Friday teenagers celebrating their 18th birthday before Novembers election are entitled to have their votes for presidential nominees counted in next weeks state primary. Plaintiffs are entitled to a judgment that the secretary abused his discretion, Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Richard Frye said in his ruling about Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted. Husted reversed an earlier decision to appeal, saying he would not after hearing the case would only be heard a day before the election, leaving the state little time to properly carry out the election. Even if we were to prevail, there is no effective way to responsibly make the changes necessary to implement an orderly election, he said. Nine teenagers from across the state claimed in a lawsuit this week that Hustles interpretation of state law that eliminated their voting rights was incorrect.  The judge said his decision affected potentially thousands of other 17-year-old voters still eager to participate at next weeks primary election. He said no secretary of state between 1981 and 2012 had ever adopted the reading of state law he was now overturning. Husted in December modified the states election manual to say 17-year-olds are allowed only to nominate candidates but are prohibited from voting for presidential delegates because they are elected, not nominated, according to the lawsuit. The teenagers argued Husteds interpretation contradicts state law and a previous ruling by the state Supreme Court that allows 17-year-olds who will be 18 by the election to vote in primaries. Alexis Brossart, a 17-year-old student at Milford High School outside Cincinnati, was excited to vote until she got a letter last week saying she could not pick a presidential nominee. I registered in February. Ever since February, Ive been excited to vote, Brossart told Reuters. The attorney for the nine teenagers said they were galvanized when they heard their votes would not count. It has caused them to think about their voting rights and get more engaged in the process, Rachel Bloomekatz said. A similar lawsuit filed in federal court by the campaign of Democrat presidential contender Bernie Sanders was halted on Friday when U.S. District Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Preston Deavers stayed the matter until the state court finding.  In the Ohio primary, 66 delegates are at stake for the Republicans and 159 for the Democrats. ",politicsNews,"March 11, 2016 ",1
Trudeau sees no flood of Americans to Canada if Trump wins,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday joked that he is not expecting an influx of unhappy Americans across the border if firebrand Republican Donald Trump becomes president. As Trumps popularity builds in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, Internet search providers have noted a spike in queries from Americans about moving to Canada.  Trudeau told students on the third day of an official visit to the United States, however, that the idea of emigration by voters who feared ending up on the losing side was common during U.S. election campaigns. If over the past decades that had been the case, wed have more people in Canada than in the United States ... It becomes an easy thing to cry out, he said during a discussion at Washingtons American University. Canadas population is just over a tenth the size of that of the United States. Trudeau said Canadians and Americans continually crossed the border to live in the other country. Thats just the nature of our friendship and relationship and to link it too much to politics is humorous ... There will always be flows back and forth and one must never fret or be disappointed with that, he said. Migration data from after Republican George W. Bushs 2000 election and 2004 re-election - other times when some liberal Americans pledged to move to Canada in protest  suggests few followed up on their promise. Trudeau, whose Liberals took power in Canada last November, had previously largely avoided questions about the consequences of a Trump victory, saying he will work with whomever wins. Earlier this week he said he would neither fight Trump nor support him but understood his appeal for people fed up with politics. Trudeau made his comments a day after talks at the White House that set the seal on better ties with the United States. Trudeau and President Barack Obama agreed joint steps to combat climate change and make it easier for people and goods to flow back and forth across their countries long border. Trump has in the past mused about tearing up the North American Free Trade Agreement, which could cripple the Canadian economy. Keeping good relations with the United States is critical for Canada, which sends 75 percent of its exports to its southern neighbor. ",politicsNews,"March 11, 2016 ",1
Reporter files criminal charge of battery against Trump campaign chief,"(Reuters) - A reporter for the conservative website Breitbart News filed a criminal complaint on Friday against Republican presidential election front-runner Donald Trumps campaign manager, saying he grabbed her arm at a rally with such force that he left bruises. A police report released on Friday showed that the reporter, Michelle Fields, said she was the victim of battery on Tuesday night at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida, where Trump spoke after that days contests in the race to nominate the partys candidate for the Nov. 8 presidential election. The accusation prompted a flurry of exchanges between Trumps campaign and Fields. The campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and Trump have denied the accusation. Lewandowski dismissed Fields as an attention seeker on Twitter. Fields published her account at Breitbart on Thursday of what happened when reporters gathered around Trump to ask him additional questions after a press conference. Fields said she asked Trump about his views on affirmative action. Trump acknowledged the question, but before he could answer I was jolted backwards. Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down. I almost fell to the ground, but was able to maintain my balance. Nonetheless, I was shaken, Fields wrote. A Trump campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, questioned Fields story on Friday. Hicks said she had not seen any encounter and said no cameras had captured the incident. Fields, who posted a photo on Twitter of bruises on her arm,  initially said she did not know who had grabbed her and caused her to stumble. Ben Terris, a Washington Post reporter who witnessed the incident, told her Lewandowski had seized her arm. He wrote his own account for his newspaper. The political news site Politico posted a transcript of an audio recording of the incident, which included an exchange between Terris and Fields. Yeah he just threw you down, Terris said to Fields, who replied, I cant believe he just did that. That was so hard. Was that Corey? Terris said that it was and later reported that Fields was tearful after the incident. In a statement on Friday, Breitbart Chief Executive Officer Larry Solov said Trumps suggestion that Fields may have invented the episode was contradicted by the evidence. Breitbart News stands behind Michelle Fields, he wrote. Hours later, however, the website posted a story disputing Terris account. The story said that footage from the event showed Trump flanked by two men: Lewandowski and a security official who bore some resemblance to the campaign manager. The person who made contact with Fields was likely not Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, the report said. Terris stood by his account on Friday. He was quoted in a blog by Washington Post reporter Erik Wemple as saying, I saw what I saw. Terris did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. Fields and Solov could not immediately be reached for comment on the complaint to police. Trumps rallies across the United States have been marked by rowdiness and physical contact between protesters and either his supporters or security personnel. At a rally in Virginia on Feb. 29, a Time magazine photographer trying to document the exit of dozens of black protesters was grabbed by the neck and shoved to the ground by a U.S. Secret Service agent. White House spokesman Josh Earnest also weighed in on the Fields incident on Friday, telling reporters: There is no excuse or justification for acts of violence against reporters who are covering a political event.

Group ends effort to draft House Speaker Ryan into election,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group that wanted to draft House Speaker Paul Ryan as a Republican presidential candidate is shutting down, a day after Ryans political operation sent the organization a cease-and-desist letter demanding it halt its campaign. In a statement on Friday the Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan said it had become increasingly clear that the Committees efforts, however well intended, could become an unwanted distraction to the Speakers current responsibilities. Ryan, a Wisconsin congressman who was Mitt Romneys vice-presidential running mate on the Republicans 2012 ticket, has said he does not want to run for president this year and disavowed the Draft Ryan group. With establishment Republicans desperately searching for a way to stop real estate businessman and former reality TV personality Donald Trumps march toward the partys nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election, Ryans name has been mentioned often as an alternative.  But Ryans political operation, in a letter sent Thursday, told the Draft Ryan group it should not be misleading people into supporting your organization and warned of legal risk, saying it believed the groups actions may constitute fraudulent solicitation of funds. In its statement Friday, the committee acknowledged that neither Ryan nor his allies had sanctioned the group. Nor was this, as it was incorrectly described in some media reports, an establishment effort to oppose any candidate currently running for President, the statement said. The effort had been funded by Earle Mack, a former U.S. ambassador to Finland. Mack had told The New York Times that he would spend up to $1 million on the Draft Ryan committee.   The organization had wanted to advance the idea that if the  Republican convention to formally nominate the partys candidate was contested, the best person to lead our country would be Speaker Paul Ryan, the statement said. It said the group had received a resounding response from around the country and was confident that if it had stayed in operation, it would have surpassed its goal of collecting 1 million signatures on an online petition to draft Ryan. A spokesman for Ryan said in response to Fridays announcement that Ryan was grateful for Macks passion. He (Mack) cares deeply about the future of our country. Speaker Ryan does too, and thats why he is focused on advancing a bold policy agenda with his House colleagues to unify our party and turn around our country, the spokesman said. The Draft Ryan group was only registered with the U.S. Federal Election Commission last week as a Super PAC, an independent political action committee that may raise unlimited sums of money.

Trump calls for trade deals with individual countries,"(Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Friday he favored the United States reaching trade agreements with individual countries as opposed to multilateral accords like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Trump, who is leading in the race for the Republican nomination for president, has made his opposition to trade deals like the 12-nation TPP and the North American Free Trade Agreement a centerpiece of his campaign toward the Nov. 8 vote. To do these deals where they wrap them up and they put 12 countries in one. TPP is an example. I want individual trade deals with individual countries, Trump told a Palm Beach, Florida, news conference ahead of the states nominating contest on Tuesday. Some countries treat us better than others. Some are worse, he said. China will take advantage of TPP. Its not in it now but believe me they come through the back door. They are watching it so closely, said Trump, a real estate developer. The deal was reached in October. Trump said he favored free trade but it must be fair. He said NAFTA had cost many Americans their jobs and TPP, which must be ratified by Congress, would do the same.  The United States already has bilateral trade deals with 20 countries, including Canada, Israel, Mexico, Peru, Singapore and South Korea.

'Big Bang Theory' trumps TV audience for latest Republican debate,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some 11.9 million Americans watched Thursdays unusually restrained Republican presidential debate on CNN, the network said on Friday, a sharp drop from the 16.9 million who tuned in last week when the Republican contenders faced off on a much rowdier evening. Thursdays figure marked the second-smallest audience for a Republican presidential encounter since the 2016 campaign debates began in August 2015, according to Nielsen data.  More people on Thursday tuned in to popular CBS comedy The Big Bang Theory, which drew 14.5 million viewers, than watched the debate in Miami, the ratings data showed. The CNN-hosted debate at the University of Miami came just five days before voters in Florida and Ohio will determine whether U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Ohio Governor John Kasich will be able to continue with their increasingly long-shot candidacies for the partys nomination to run in the Nov. 8 general election. With previous assaults on front-runner Donald Trump having failed to knock him down, Rubio and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas chose a more civil approach on Thursday, raising questions about Trumps policy positions without attacking him personally. Trumps presence has boosted TV audiences for presidential debates, helping to attract a record 24 million viewers for his first official outing as a candidate in August last year.  Since then, however, audiences have dropped off, with only the raucous March 3 Republican encounter coming close to the interest seen last year. Democratic TV debates have fared less well with the public and have struggled to attract audiences of more than 10 million since January.

Two-state solutions involves the idea that there are two parties that are willing to agree to that, and there are not.

NY Assembly speaker drives home priorities ahead of budget release,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New Yorks top Democratic legislator drove home his budget priorities on Friday, touching on the minimum wage, paid family leave and education ahead of the release of the state Assemblys spending plan scheduled for later that day. Assembly speaker Carl Heastie highlighted the proposals that have become a rallying point for Democrats both in the state and nationally, saying that he was very optimistic an agreement could be reached over a state-wide $15 minimum wage with the Republican controlled Senate. Heastie, speaking at an event in New York City, stressed his support for paid family leave. The Assembly passed a bill in February that would allow workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid leave to care for a new child or a sick relative. The initiative is supported by Governor Andrew Cuomo, also a Democrat. The speaker highlighted $1.7 billion in higher education spending for the state and city public university systems, including funding a two-year tuition freeze, and a $2.1 bln increase in education funding for the states public schools. The Assemblys school spending proposal is $1.2 billion over  Cuomos executive budget.  Confidence in the state capital Albany was shaken last year after the convictions on corruption charges of the speakers of both the Senate and the Assembly. Heastie became speaker after charges were brought against his predecessor Sheldon Silver. Heastie said he will release ethics proposals also on Friday that seek to limit outside pay for legislators, and put conditions on roles legislators can take in the private sector. The Assemblys budget will be released later on Friday and passed by the Assembly on Monday, Heasties spokesperson Mike Whyland said. It follows the release of Cuomos $145 billion executive budget in January.  The Senate has also released parts of its one house budget, promising to cut middle class tax rates by 25 percent through 2025, leading to a reduction in the tax burden of $3.5 billion. The three budget plans need to be reconciled by the start of the states financial year on April 1. Cuomo has made passing an on-time budget a barometer of good governance and has managed to pass all five of his previous budgets on time. ",politicsNews,"March 11, 2016 ",1
Rubio campaign urges supporters in Ohio to back Kasich,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubios campaign urged a tactical vote against party front-runner Donald Trump on Friday, saying Rubio supporters in Ohio should vote for the states governor, John Kasich, next week.

That is indisputable, he added, referring to the U.S. senators home state. Rubio, Kasich and Ted Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, are battling to stop Trump from winning the nomination to represent the party in the Nov. 8 presidential election.

American fanfare for Canada's PM raises eyebrows back home,"TORONTO (Reuters) - The attention paid by Americans to the visit of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Washington this week sparked cynicism and delight back home, as Canadians more accustomed to being ignored werent entirely sure what to make of the fanfare. With photos of the visit between Trudeau and U.S. President Barack Obama gracing Fridays front pages of the New York Times and Washington Post, Canadians lined up to dismiss and embrace the high-profile of the visit in equal measure. The American media noticed us! a headline in Canadas National Post newspaper noted in mock delight, as it devoted the entire front page to a photo of Obama and Trudeau hugging, eyes closed, and the next four pages to details of the visit, noting the budding bromance between Obama and Trudeau. But columnist Rex Murphy noted the parallels between the media attention of Trudeau and that devoted to the newly elected Obama years earlier, and the risk of being judged on style before substance is proven: ... while its always nice for Canada, or her representatives, to be in Americas and the worlds eye, too much should not be made of it.  The election of the photogenic Trudeau, 44, in October has vaulted Canada from obscurity to celebrity abroad, with foreign news outlets and fashion magazines alike praising the Liberal prime minister for his progressive take on feminism, the environment and refugees, as well as his good looks. That global audiences are joining the homegrown Trudeaumania, a phenomenon first seen a generation ago amid the popularity of Trudeaus father, former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, leaves Canadians a bit bemused. You would think that this was tantamount to the moon landing! one commenter wrote in response to a Canadian Broadcasting Corp solicitation for comments on what Canadians thought of the Washington visit. Enough with the glitter and love-ins, another chimed in, trying to counter a wave of positive comment about the success of Trudeau on the world stage. But while the Toronto Star, the nations largest newspaper, acknowledged the high-profile visit would be hard for cynical Canadians to take, it cautioned against scorning the fanfare. Dismiss showmanship at your peril because without it, we are nothing more than squabbles over soft-wood lumber and country-of-origin labeling. It may not last. But right now it is a win for Canada, columnist Tim Harper wrote. ",politicsNews,"March 11, 2016 ",1
Exclusive: U.S. labor powerhouse to launch anti-Trump ad campaign,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The AFL-CIO, the largest U.S. federation of labor unions, will launch digital attack ads targeting Republican front-runner Donald Trump next week as part of a multi-pronged effort to derail the New York billionaires bid for the White House and dampen union workers enthusiasm for him. Officials at the AFL-CIO, an umbrella group of 56 unions representing 12.5 million workers, told Reuters the ads will depict Trump as anti-union, and will appear on Facebook and Twitter.  The officials said the anti-Trump advertising effort would likely expand over the coming months. At the same time, an AFL-CIO affiliate organization will ramp up adoor-to-door campaign to undermine the candidate in Ohio and Pennsylvania, key battleground states in theNov. 8 presidential election. Donald Trump has tapped into the very real and understandable anger of working people. But while he says hes with Americas working people, when you look close, its just hot air, AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka told Reuters. Donald Trump is nothing but a house of cards, and once we educate people, the house of cards comes crashing down, he said. Union leaders are increasingly concerned about Trumps appeal to labor, typically a stronghold of the Democratic Party, because of his promises to scrap free trade deals that have led to manufacturing job losses in the United States. The AFL-CIO is entering the political fray several months earlier than in past elections, given the unique cycle created by Trumps candidacy, spokesman Josh Goldstein said. The initial ads will be modeled after a text message blast that began Thursday featuring an image of Trump with a statement he made supporting right-to-work laws, which weaken organized labor by limiting their ability to collect membership dues. Several states have passed such laws, and the U.S. Congress has considered a similar measure.  I like right to work. My position on right to work is 100 percent, Trump said in a radio interview in South Carolina last month.  The text campaign on which the ads will be modeled featured a quote from Trumka, hitting Trump on right-to-work, and characterizing him as racist: Donald Trumps bigoted comments are bad enough. Now, he supports right to work. Tell him right to work is wrong for working people. Trump has been widely criticized for describing Mexican illegal immigrants as rapists and criminals, and for proposing a temporary ban on Muslims seeking to come to the United States. The AFL-CIO declined to say how much the initial digital ads would cost, but the federation spent nearly $9 million in the 2012 election cycle on outside spending in addition to money given directly to candidates, according to Open Secrets data. The AFL-CIO typically waits to endorse a presidential candidate until there is a de facto Democratic nominee. But Trumka, a former coal miner and leader of that union, has made clear he believes Trump in particular would be a disastrous candidate for workers. In a speech last week he called him a bigot and anti-American. An official representing Trumps campaign was not immediately available to comment, but Trump has said repeatedly that he has support within unions.  National unions nearly always endorse Democratic presidential candidates but Trump has built his insurgent campaign in part on a mission that many unions share: scrapping international trade deals.  There are some signs Trumps message is resonating beyond the 20 to 30 percent of rank-and-file union members that vote Republican, attracting political independents and even some frustrated Democrats.  At a recent picket outside a steel plant near Canton, Ohio, workers cited former President Bill Clintons support of the North American Free Trade Agreement more than 20 years ago as a reason why they may support Trump over Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in a general election. For a lot of us, its ABC - Anybody But Clinton, Mike Newbold told Reuters. Clinton has said she evaluates every trade deal to make sure it protects workers and that she opposes one being finalized by the Obama administration. Her campaign said they are confident her plan to help struggling manufacturing areas will earn her support from union members.     AFL-CIOs affiliate, Working America, has noticed Trumps inroads with working-class Americans, and recently sent canvassers to talk to 1,689 likely voters with household incomes of $75,000 or less in Cleveland, Ohio, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to learn more about Trumps appeal. Working-class voters are up for grabs this time in a really significant way. These folks need good information, and well fill that gap, said Karen Nussbaum, executive director of Working America.  According to Nussbaum, workers said they were frustrated with politics and worried about the economy. Of those who had already settled on a candidate, 38 percent chose Trump. But more than half were still undecided. She said the results of that initial canvas would be used to guide a massive door-to-door campaign to have more than half a million one-on-one conversations with Ohio voters during 2016, to help them make decisions that actually solve their problems as opposed to phony solutions. Working America is adding staff to its offices in Columbus and Cleveland to support the operation, and will open another soon in Cincinnati, she said. Labor strategist Steve Rosenthal said that in every presidential election there is a sense that white, working-class union men could desert the Democratic Party. But I think when all is said and done, when unions put their programs into gear, in person and one-on-one in homes and in their communities, union members will vote overwhelmingly for the Democratic nominee, Rosenthal said. Trump might have some appeal right now, but once you start to peel away his record - his manufacturing in China, his relationships with unions - hes a pretty good target.

U.S. Navy may raise current 308-ship target for fleet,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy will likely increase its requirement for a 308-ship fleet given the rapidly changing world security situation, including the U.S. battle against Islamic State, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson said on Thursday. Richardson said the Navy was reviewing an assessment completed in 2012 and updated in 2014, before Russias reemergence as a global power competitor, and the start of the U.S.-led campaign to defeat Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. I would bet a paycheck that its going to be a number greater than 308 ships, just by virtue of the additive nature of the complexity and the contestants that are confronting us right now, Richardson told an event hosted by Washington defense consultant Jim McAleese and Credit Suisse. The top U.S. naval officer said the Navy was already increasing its purchases of Virginia-class submarines built by General Dynamics Corp and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc., but would also invest in unmanned vessels. The study is due to be completed this summer in time to inform the Navys fiscal 2018 budget proposal, according to a Navy official. The Navys fleet is currently around 285 ships. Republican lawmakers have repeatedly called for an increase in the size of the Navys fleet, arguing that the sheer number of threats around the world requires more ships to help the United States project power. Others argue that todays ships are more capable and advanced than in years past, increasing the power and capability of each ship and making the larger fleets of the 1980s unnecessary.

Some Hispanic Republicans fear for party's future if Trump wins in Florida,"HIALEAH, Florida (Reuters) - Conservative Hispanic activists fear a win by Republican frontrunner Donald Trump in Floridas presidential nominating contest next week will deal a major setback to efforts to widen the partys appeal beyond white voters, potentially dooming hopes of retaking the White House from Democrats in 2016. Some of the activists said in interviews they feared a Trump win could prompt many Latino Republicans, angry at his anti-immigrant rhetoric, to stay home on Nov. 8, Election Day, or worse, support the Democratic nominee.  Sadly, the damage is going to be felt by the Republican Party for years, said Javier Palomarez, president and CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, of a possible Trump win in Florida on March 15. This is a turning point, he said. Trump has dominated opinion polls and early nominating contests, in large part because of his pledge to build a wall along the border with Mexico; his labeling of Mexicans as criminals and rapists; and his accusations that immigrant workers steal American jobs. That kind of talk is well received by many white Republican voters, but not by minorities, polls show.  That's a problem for the party, because while the American electorate has become more diverse in the last three years, Republican support among Hispanic likely voters has shrunk, from 30.6 percent in 2012 to 26 percent in 2015, according to an analysis of Reuters/Ipsos polling data. Meanwhile, Hispanic Democrats grew by 6 percentage points to 59.6 percent. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1Oj9SPi) Trumps campaign declined to comment, but he has consistently argued he can win the Latino vote, in part because his companies have employed thousands of Hispanics. Theyre incredible people. Theyre incredible workers. I love them. I love them, he said at a debate in February. Much of the establishment wing of the Republican party has thrown its weight behind Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a first-generation Cuban American. Rubio, however, lags Trump by 15 points in polls in Florida and may be forced out of the race if the New York businessman bests him. For Mark Gomez, a 20-year-old Cuban-American student at the University of Miami and a Rubio volunteer, the differences between Rubios and Trumps approaches hit home when earlier this month on Twitter, a Trump supporter called him an anchor baby. Gomez was born in the United States of Cuban refugee parents. Immigration critics sometimes use anchor babies to describe U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, usually from Latin America. Immigration groups say the phrase is offensive. Trump, Gomez said, is just playing into peoples fears. Rubio has toured Floridas Latino enclaves in recent weeks, switching easily between Spanish and English at his rallies, while his allied super PAC, or independent fundraising group, has outspent all rivals combined in ads to boost him and erase Trumps polling lead. Among Rubios challenges in besting Trump, however, could be drawing in younger generations of Floridas Hispanics. Unlike conservatives of the past, who could take the Cuban-American vote in Florida for granted if they aggressively criticized the Castro government in Cuba, candidates are dealing with a new generation that is leaning more heavily to the Democratic Party. A decade ago 64 percent of Cuban registered voters nationwide identified with the Republican party. Thats now down to 47 percent, according to the Pew Research Center. And among young Cubans, from 18 to 49, more than half now identify with or lean toward the Democrats.      A lot of those Cubans who come from the island, that resentment, that pain, that hurt has really driven how theyve reacted politically. Our generation is a generation removed from that in a lot of ways, said Gabriel Pendas, 33, of Miami. He called Rubio so outdated from how a lot of people feel.  Following Mitt Romneys defeat as the Republican partys presidential nominee in 2012, in which he received just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote nationwide, the Republican National Committee underwent an extensive and painful self-examination  to determine the root causes of its failure. One thing was clear from the autopsy: The party needed to expand a voter base skewing too white and too old. The hope among party leaders, like Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Preibus, was that a young, dynamic field of candidates like Rubio, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, and others, would position the party well to reclaim some share of Latino vote from the Democrats. Rubio stood central to those hopes. Young, telegenic, bilingual, and armed with a compelling backstory, he seemed made-to-order. Rubios tone, his aspirational message, his shared language and culture, makes him an ideal candidate, said Daniel Garza, director of the LIBRE Institute in Miami, a conservative Hispanic advocacy group.  But Trump, as he has done so often during this election season, took a wrecking ball to those plans.  His hardline immigration stance forced many of his rivals - including Cruz - to adopt a harsher approach on immigration, while leaving others such as former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who has dropped out of the race, adrift.  Weve lost an incredible opportunity, said Alfonso Aguilar, president of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, referring to Trumps front-runner status. Addressing a rally on Wednesday night in Hialeah, home to the largest number of Cubans outside of Cuba, Rubio spoke in both English and Spanish and urged supporters to come out and vote in massive numbers. Awaiting Rubio at the rally, Cuban-born Ahmed Martel, 45,  was asked what he would do if Trump, not Rubio, was the partys nominee in the fall. I wont vote, Martel said. I cant vote for him.

"Obama, Trudeau mark better Canada ties with climate, trade accords","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and new Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday ended a frosty period in bilateral ties by agreeing to tackle climate change and strive to settle a long-lasting trade dispute over Canadian softwood lumber exports. The neighboring countries are traditionally close but relations had soured under former prime minister Stephen Harper, who hectored the White House in a failed bid to push through U.S. approval for the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Obama and Trudeau, whose Liberals came to power last November promising better cooperation with Washington, pledged joint steps to fight global warming, including cutting methane emissions from oil and gas operations. The countries committed to cutting emissions of methane by 40 to 45 percent below 2012 levels by 2025, to take steps to fight climate change in the Arctic, and to speed development of green technologies. They also told officials to look for solutions to a lengthy dispute over exports of Canadian softwood lumber, as well as promising to make it easier for goods and people to cross the long shared border. I am grateful that I have him as a partner ... When it comes to the central challenges that we face, our two nations are more closely aligned than ever, Obama told a news conference after talks with Trudeau. The President and I agree on many things including, of paramount importance, the direction we want to take our countries in to ensure a clean and prosperous future, said Trudeau. In another sign of friendlier bilateral ties, Trudeau invited Obama to address the Canadian Parliament this year. Americans have been captivated by the photogenic Trudeau, 44, whose father, Pierre Trudeau, was prime minister from 1968 through 1979, and again from 1980 to 1984. His visit will be capped by a state dinner on Thursday but that could be overshadowed by the race to succeed Obama in Novembers presidential election. Candidates for the Republican nomination will hold a debate on Thursday night. Trudeau declined to say what he would do in case the next president was Donald Trump, who has mused about tearing up the North American Free Trade Agreement. The friendship between our two countries goes far beyond any two individuals or any ideologies, he said. I have tremendous confidence in the American people, and look forward to working with whomever they choose to send to this White House later this year. ",politicsNews,"March 10, 2016 ",1
Obama on growing friendship with Trudeau: 'What's not to like?',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Thursday turned the page on years of shaky ties with Canada by staging a lavish White House welcome for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, making clear the new leader is a man after his own heart. Trudeau, 44, the left-leaning Liberal Party leader and son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, took power last November. He already enjoys a closer bond with the Democratic president than his right-of-center predecessor, Stephen Harper of the Conservatives, managed in more than six years of dealing with the Obama administration. He campaigned on a message of hope and of change. His positive and optimistic vision is inspiring young people, Obama said after meeting with Trudeau in the Oval Office. So, from my perspective, whats not to like? he added, also noting Trudeaus commitment to the environment. Keeping good relations with the United States is critical for Canada, which sends 75 percent of its exports to its southern neighbor. Trudeau brought along six Cabinet ministers in a sign of how seriously he took the visit. Obama struck a warm, informal tone from the start and told Trudeau at a state dinner he may well be the most popular Canadian named Justin. Singer Justin Bieber is from Canada. The White House dinner was the first for a Canadian leader since 1997. Obama never did the same for Harper, who irritated the administration by insisting it approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Obama blocked the project last year. At an arrival ceremony on Thursday morning, Obama teased Trudeau about the failure in recent years of Canadian hockey teams to win the sports top honor. Wheres the Stanley Cup right now? he asked. Im sorry.Is it in my hometown with the Chicago Blackhawks?  Trudeau replied there was a high U.S. demand for Canadian exports, including three of the star players who helped the Blackhawks win the National Hockey League championship last year. In Ottawa, Conservative Party foreign affairs spokesman Tony Clement said Trudeaus visit had little deeper meaning, given that Obama would out of office in January 2017. Even so, the next few months could be crucial for Canada, said Colin Robertson of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute, a former senior diplomat with two U.S. postings. Encouraged by Obamas tone, American officials are starting to re-examine important elements of the bilateral relationship in a favorable way, Robertson said. The next administration is not going to have Canada on their radar, he said in a phone interview. But their reference point when they do ... will be this review conducted under the best possible auspices. ",politicsNews,"March 11, 2016 ",1
Exclusive: House Speaker Ryan seeks halt to presidential 'Draft Ryan' group,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - House Speaker Paul Ryans political operation sent a cease-and-desist letter on Thursday to a group that is trying to draft him as a Republican presidential candidate, urging it to halt its activities and warning of legal risk. With establishment Republicans desperately searching for a way to stop real estate businessman and former reality TV personality Donald Trumps march toward the partys nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election, Ryans name has been mentioned often as an alternative. But he has said he does not want to run for president this year and has disavowed the Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan group. The organization has continued attempts to collect 1 million signatures on an online petition to draft Ryan, arguing that the very definition of a draft movement is to encourage a reluctant participant to join. The Draft Ryan group was another indication of Ryans rise to the Republican Partys top ranks since he became speaker of the House of Representatives last year. Ryan, a Wisconsin congressman, was Mitt Romneys vice-presidential running mate on the Republicans 2012 ticket. A spokesman for Draft Ryan, David Catalfamo, said the letter was a sad commentary on the state of our politics today, adding, The Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan is simply a patriotic effort to save our party and save our country. The group registered with the U.S. Federal Election Commission as a Super PAC, an independent political action committee that may raise unlimited sums of money. Timothy Kronquist, an attorney for Ryans political operation, addressed the letter to the groups treasurer, David Satterfield. It urged the group to immediately cease and desist from any representations that it is acting on Ryans behalf or raising funds that would assist Ryans campaign activities. We believe the actions of your organization are not in compliance with federal law and may constitute fraudulent solicitation of funds, the letter said. Speaker Ryan has repeatedly announced publicly that he is not running for president in 2016. ... It is in the public interest for your organization to cease potentially confusing and misleading people into supporting your organization. A copy of the letter, which was dated Thursday, was seen by Reuters. A person close to Draft Ryan said the group had removed the donate button from its website to clarify that the effort is not a fund-raising exercise, and said the site would be changed so people can sign the petition without leaving their email addresses. He said the effort so far had been funded by Earle Mack, a former U.S. ambassador to Finland. Mack has told The New York Times that he would spend up to $1 million on the Draft Ryan committee. Mack showed no sign of backing down on Thursday afternoon in an interview with Fox Business News, saying Draft Ryan only sought to propose Ryan as a unifying candidate in the event Republicans deadlock over who should be their nominee at the party convention in July.  Let me tell your viewers to please go to Draft Speaker Ryan.com. Were collecting a million signatures to raise the awareness that we love the speaker, and the speaker is the right man for the job, Mack said. Asked whether Ryan might not want the nomination, Mack acknowledged, I dont even know the man. Trump has racked up primary wins and expanded his lead this week despite attacks from the partys establishment, which is trying to stop him from claiming the nomination at the Republican convention in July. Ryan has abstained from endorsing any presidential candidate in the 2016 race.  (Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh, Bill Trott, Grant McCool and Leslie Adler) This article was funded in part by SAP.

Obama hopes 'cooler heads' prevail on Supreme Court nominee,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Wednesday he hoped cooler heads will prevail and that the Republican-led Senate will act on his U.S. Supreme Court nominee but top Republicans dug in their heels, defending their refusal to consider anyone Obama picks. Obama has narrowed to five his list of candidates to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13. Obamas nominee could tip the nine-member court to the left for the first time in decades. The Republicans who control the Senate have vowed not to hold confirmation hearings or an up-or-down vote on anyone Obama picks, saying the choice should belong to the next president who takes office in January after the Nov. 8 presidential election. My hope is that cooler heads will prevail and people will reflect on whats at stake here once a nomination is made, Obama said at a news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The White House is interviewing five candidates, federal judges Sri Srinivasan, Jane Kelly, Ketanji Brown Jackson, Paul Watford and Merrick Garland, according to a source familiar with the process. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, whose panel handles Supreme Court nominations, offered a lengthy defense of the Senate Republicans stance. Grassley accused Democrats of a charade with feigned outrage over the Republican refusal to consider Obamas nominee simply to score as many political points as possible. Regardless of what some are willing to admit publicly, everybody knows any nominee submitted in the middle of this presidential campaign isnt getting confirmed. Everybody. The White House knows it. Senate Democrats know it. Republicans know it.Even the press knows it, Grassley told a committee hearing. Under the U.S. Constitution, the president selects a Supreme Court nominee and the Senate confirms or rejects the nominee. Im going to do my job, Obama said, promising an eminently qualified nominee. And it will then be up to Senate Republicans to decide whether they want to follow the Constitution and abide by the rules of fair play that ultimately undergird our democracy and that ensure that the Supreme Court does not just become one more extension of our polarized politics, Obama said.  Denis McDonough, Obamas chief of staff, and other presidential aides met with Judiciary Committee Democrats at the White House on the nomination. Afterward, the Democratic senators predicted Republicans would buckle under public pressure and drop their obstruction once Obama names his nominee. We are optimistic that, soon enough, not only will the president nominate, but our Republican colleagues will see the light, said U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer, forecasting that Obamas nominee will be confirmed with bipartisan support. Separately, one Republican senator indicated Senate Republicans would act on a nominee if they had a Republican president. If a conservative presidents replacing a conservative justice, theres a little more accommodation to it, Wisconsins Ron Johnson told a radio interviewer. President Obamas nominee would flip the court from a 5-4 conservative to a 5-4 liberal-controlled court. And thats the concern, Johnson added. THE GRASSLEY-KELLY CONNECTION Grassley in 2013 spoke in favor of Kellys nomination to the St. Louis-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. She was confirmed by a 96-0 Senate vote. Kelly, an Obama classmate at Harvard Law School, is based in Iowa and previously served as a federal public defender there. The Iowa senator rejected any notion he could be persuaded to drop his opposition if Obama were to nominate a candidate previously confirmed by him and other Republicans. He denounced the idea that the White House selection process was guided by the raw political calculation of what they think will exert the most political pressure on me. Choosing someone like Kelly from Iowa would be an obvious political ploy that would fail, Grassley added. Senator Orrin Hatch, another Judiciary Committee Republican, said in an interview that Garland, whose previous nomination to the appellate court he backed, is a fine man who would be a moderate choice for the high court.  But Hatch said he opposed acting even on Garland. It isnt a question about the person in my opinion. Its a question about the timing ... and the atmosphere that we have around here, which is poisonous, Hatch said. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid delivered his latest attack on Grassley, saying on the Senate floor that it was a little strange, a little odd that Grassley would not hold hearings even for Kelly, considering his past support. Iowas Tom Miller, a Democrat, was among a group of attorneys general from 19 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico who sent a letter to Grassley and other Senate leaders urging them to act promptly on Obamas nominee.

Bid to block Pakistan F-16 sale fails in U.S. Senate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday blocked an effort to prevent the $700 million sale of Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan, although a key lawmaker said he would not allow the use of U.S. funds to finance it. Lawmakers voted 71 to 24 against an attempt introduced by Republican Senator Rand Paul to prevent the sale under legislation known as the Arms Control Act. President Barack Obamas administration announced on Feb. 12 that it had approved the sale to Pakistan of the aircraft, as well as radars and other equipment. It drew immediate criticism from India and concern from some members of Congress.  Paul had called Pakistan an uncertain ally and other lawmakers expressed concerns about Pakistans nuclear program, commitment to fighting terrorist organizations and cooperation in the Afghanistan peace process. However, they generally supported the sale, saying the South Asian state needs to modernize its air force and counter-terrorism activities. Republican Senator Bob Corker said he would use his power as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to bar the use of any U.S. funds for the deal. In a statement, Corker said, Prohibiting a taxpayer subsidy sends a much-needed message to Pakistan that it needs to change its behaviour, but preventing the purchase of U.S. aircraft would do more harm than good by paving the way for countries like Russia and China to sell to Pakistan while also inhibiting greater cooperation on counter terrorism. The United States identified Pakistan as a key partner in its war against terror following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and spent billions of dollars on military aid to help the country fight insurgents. But there is growing consternation in Washington about continuing with the same level of assistance unless Pakistan provides evidence it is using the funds effectively to eliminate militants.

"Blame me for Trump? No way, says Obama","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - He has been attacked over countless issues in partisan Washington, but U.S. President Barack Obama drew the line at this one: the idea that he is responsible for the rise of Donald Trump and the attendant Republican Party disarray. I have been blamed by Republicans for a lot of things, but being blamed for their primaries and who theyre selecting for their party (nominee) is novel, Obama told a news conference on Thursday. What Im not going to do is to validate some notion that the Republican crack-up thats been taking place is ... a consequence of actions that Ive taken, the Democratic president said. Obama had been asked how he viewed being identified as the cause of Trumps ascent to front-runner in the Republican race to pick a presidential candidate for the Nov. 8 election.    Obama seemed to relish the question, replying with both serious criticism of Republicans and some pointed mockery of Trump. The New York billionaire is well ahead in the Republican race after the first six weeks of primary nominating contests but his bombastic style and statements on Muslims, immigrants and trade have dismayed many in the party establishment. Many party leaders worry Trump would lose to the eventual Democratic nominee in Novembers election to replace Obama.  Obama, whose White House tenure has been marked by steady resistance to most of his policies by Republicans in Congress, has said previously he regretted not being able to reduce the polarization between the two parties in Washington. But he scoffed on Thursday at the suggestion that his presidency had fueled the chaos among the Republicans. Conservative news outlets on television, radio and the Internet had convinced the Republican political base for seven years that cooperation with him was a betrayal and that maximalist absolutist positions were advantageous, Obama said. He was holding a joint news conference with visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In a clear dig at Trump, Obama said he had not prompted critics to question his U.S. citizenship or birth in Hawaii.    Before he launched his longshot presidential run last year, Trump was a high-profile leader of the so-called birther movement, which believed Obama was born abroad and not eligible to be president, until he produced his Hawaii birth certificate to put the issue to rest.  What youre seeing within the Republican Party is, to some degree, all those efforts over a course of time creating an environment where somebody like a Donald Trump can thrive, Obama said. For good measure, he took a swipe at two of Trumps rivals for the Republican nomination, saying the real estate magnates position on immigration was not much different from that of U.S. Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Obama urged conservatives who were troubled by the partys position to reflect on what it is about the politics theyve engaged in that allows the circus weve been seeing to transpire.

Republicans may generate less heat at Miami debate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidates may find themselves in a more subdued debate than usual on Thursday night in Miami, since nothing Donald Trumps rivals have thrown at him has made a major dent in his front-running campaign. After the histrionics of last weeks gathering in Detroit, the four remaining candidates are likely to search for higher ground as they offer closing arguments to Republican voters, particularly those in Florida and Ohio, who vote next Tuesday in nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election.  The burden is particularly heavy on U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Ohio Governor John Kasich, who must do well in their home states or face pressure to exit the race. While Kasich is holding his own against Trump in Ohio opinion polls, Rubio has lagged far behind Trump in Florida. Trumps victories in Michigan, Mississippi and Hawaii on Tuesday added to his momentum after a week of attacks by mainstream Republicans who are offended by his statements on Muslims, women and illegal immigrants and alarmed by his threats to international trade deals. Trump defended his calls for a tougher U.S. stance on free trade on Thursday, saying the United States has been taken advantage of in negotiations with other countries. He also cited currency devaluations as a particular problem. I like free trade but you have to be represented by very, very good and smart and cunning people and we are not, Trump said in an interview on CNBC. Other countries are and thats why theyre all taking advantage. The tough-talking billionaire businessman told CNN on Wednesday he expected the debate to be a nicer, softer, lighter debate, I hope. But he added: Ill be ready. Im the only one who can beat Hillary, a reference to Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton. The tone could be set by Trump, 69, who forecast before several previous debates that he would take a more measured approach, only to quickly get into a verbal brawl with his rivals. The CNN-hosted debate will be held at the University of Miami at 8:30 p.m. (0130 GMT on Friday). I would focus on a positive uplifting message that takes us back to why theyre running for president and whats at stake in this election, said Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney. In Detroit last Thursday, Trump came under sustained fire from Rubio, 44, over parts of his business empire such as Trump University, a now-defunct venture that critics said offered a flimsy education. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas piled on Trump over his past support for Democratic causes. Trump blasted Rubio throughout the debate as a lightweight and Cruz as a liar. The Trump-Rubio debate clash in Detroit followed an abrupt change in Rubios campaign to begin raising personal questions about Trump, such as saying he had small hands, a statement Trump saw as a reference to his penis size. Rubio said he now regretted the personal insults. In terms of things that have to do with personal stuff, yeah, at the end of the day, its not something Im entirely proud of. My kids were embarrassed by it, and if I had to do it again, I wouldnt, Rubio told MSNBC on Wednesday. Cruz, 45, who would like to knock Rubio and Kasich out of the race so he could draw more support from anti-Trump Republican voters, will seek to use the debate to position himself as the best Trump alternative. Trump is clearly trying to reach out and be a little more statesmanlike, said Cruz backer Saul Anuzis, a former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. Cruz is going to make the case as to why he can beat Trump and be the viable alternative. From our perspective, we think its a two-man race, were the only one with a path. Rubio is fighting for survival and is facing something of a last stand in Florida. Rival campaigns said Rubio may feel a need to return to the optimistic message he stuck to for months before getting sidetracked by Trump. Rubio told Fox News on Wednesday the campaign was always going to come down to who wins Florida. The nominee has to win Florida. You cant be the Republican nominee if you dont win Florida, he said. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz have one shot at denying Trump the nomination - preventing him from assembling the required 1,237 delegates to win the nomination outright, which would mean delegates would have to choose the nominee at their July 18-21 convention in Cleveland. Trump said on CNN on Wednesday that 1,237 was an artificial number and that if he entered the convention with more delegates than his rivals, he should be the nominee. While he has vowed to wage war against the party if he is denied the nomination at the convention, Kasich, 63, said it was possible for Republicans to have a contested convention and emerge united. Can you go to a convention and come out united? Absolutely, he told a Fox News town hall on Wednesday.

Senate banking panel approves Szubin for key sanctions post,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate Banking Committee approved Barack Obamas choice to be the Treasury Departments undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence by a 14-8 vote on Thursday, nearly 11 months after the president nominated him. Obama nominated Adam Szubin in April 2015 for the post, which oversees U.S. sanctions as well as efforts to cut off money illegally flowing to nations such as Iran and North Korea and groups including Islamic State. But his nomination got caught up in partisan fighting over foreign policy, particularly the international nuclear agreement with Iran announced in July, between the administration of Obama, a Democrat, and Republicans who control Congress. Senator Richard Shelby, the banking panels chairman, did not allow votes on any of Obamas nominees until after surviving a challenge in Alabamas primary on March 1. All eight of the no votes on the committee were from Republicans, although four Republicans joined all of the panels 10 Democrats in recommending Szubin. The nomination must still be approved by the full Senate. Shelby, who voted no, told reporters the nominee is a nice man, and qualified for many jobs. But the policies he would have to carry out, a lot of us oppose them. In a statement issued later, he said, Mr. Szubins role at the Treasury Department has required him to both promote and defend the Administrations ill-conceived Iran nuclear agreement. I could not support his nomination today because of his participation in facilitating a deal that I believe is crippling to our national security. The deal between Iran and major powers eases international sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbs on Irans nuclear program. The banking panel was the only committee in the U.S. Senate that did not vote on any Obama nominee in 2015. About 14 are still outstanding. Shelby said he did not know when the full Senate might vote on Szubin, who is currently acting undersecretary. The simple fact is that the Senate should have unanimously confirmed Mr. Szubin last spring instead of keeping him in limbo for almost an entire year, Senator Sherrod Brown, the committees top Democrat, said in a statement. Besides Shelby, Republican Senators Mike Crapo, Tom Cotton, Dean Heller, Mark Kirk, Ben Sasse, Tim Scott and Pat Toomey opposed Szubins nomination. Republicans Bob Corker, David Vitter, Mike Rounds and Jerry Moran backed him. ",politicsNews,"March 10, 2016 ",1

"Cruz, Rubio want to send more prisoners to Guantanamo","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House hopefuls Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and 13 other Republican U.S. senators on Thursday demanded that Islamic State fighters be sent to the Guantanamo Bay detention center, which would boost its population as President Barack Obama moves to close it. The lawmakers introduced a resolution expressing the need to detain the fighters at the controversial military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after reports that U.S. special operations forces had captured leaders of the militant group. There should be no confusion in the minds of our enemies that, if captured, they will be sent to the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay to be interrogated, Rubio said in a statement.  Rubio, Cruz, billionaire front-runner Donald Trump and Ohio Governor John Kasich face off in a presidential debate on Thursday night in Miami. The resolution was led by Senator Steve Daines. In addition to Rubio and Cruz, the co-sponsors were Senators Jerry Moran, Cory Gardner, Tom Cotton, Mark Kirk, Orrin Hatch, Joni Ernst, Johnny Isakson, John Boozman, Pat Roberts, Jim Inhofe, Tim Scott and David Vitter. The measure would be nonbinding but underscores the strong resistance in the Republican-controlled Congress toward Obamas efforts to close the detention camp. Obama launched a final push to persuade Congress to close the detention center for suspected members of groups such as al Qaeda last month. The Obama administration has been trying for years to make good on a pledge the president made at the beginning of his first term in 2009 to close the facility but has faced stiff political opposition. Republican lawmakers insist the prison is an essential tool for holding and interrogating suspects who threaten the United States. Opponents of the detention center say that holding prisoners for years without charge or trial is a human rights violation that goes against fundamental U.S. values and potentially endangers American military personnel.

Trump calls global currency devaluations 'dangerous' for U.S,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday blasted currency devaluations around the world for hurting the U.S. economy and costing American jobs, and defended his calls for a tougher U.S. stance on trade. Asked about the European Central Banks decision on Thursday to cut interest rates, Trump told CNBC that such devaluations were driving manufacturing and other jobs outside of the United States. We just sit back and do nothing, Trump said. Thats getting to be very dangerous as far as Im concerned. A more effective economic move than devaluations would be charging a tax on products made abroad and sold in the United States, particularly those from China, Trump said. China is the grand master of all, Trump said. I have great relationships and business relationships with China, and even those people say they cant believe what theyre getting away with. Additionally, the front-runner for the Republican nomination in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election said that while he supports free trade if it is fair, the United States has been taken advantage of in negotiations. Trump also said if elected president he would move quickly to stop corporate inversions - when a U.S. company acquires an overseas firm and reduces its tax bill by moving its headquarters to the purchased firms location. Trump said he thinks corporate inversions cost the United States twice as much as estimated. He said drugmaker Pfizer Inc and other companies that have recently left the country show there are things that are very structurally wrong with what were doing. I think its $5 trillion, but I dont think our country has any idea what it is, but I think its much more than $2.5 trillion, he said, referring to U.S. tax revenue lost when companies pull off corporate inversions. Trump said Republicans and Democrats agree they want to halt such inversions, but they cant make a deal because they dont have leadership. I could make a deal in 15 minutes by getting people in a room, Trump said. Everybody wants that money to come into the United States. ... It would be so easy.

U.S. hedge fund managers pour money into 2016 race and Trump is a factor,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major U.S. hedge fund managers are on pace this year to more than double the amount they gave in the 2012 election campaign, with independent fundraising groups backing Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Ted Cruz receiving the most so far. About $47 million has been lavished on presidential candidates and lawmakers and the political action committees that support them by two dozen of the industry's top managers in the first 13 months of this election season, according to a Reuters review of Federal Election Commission filings. (For a list of the top givers see tmsnrt.rs/1nlPYZv) Most of the hedge fund support going to Cruz and Clinton has come from a handful of people out of the two dozen managers studied. Robert Mercer, co-chief executive of Renaissance Technologies, for example, has given $11 million to Keep the Promise I, a Super PAC that supports Cruz. Mercer is an enigmatic computer programmer who is a powerful financial force in conservative politics. Cruz wants to abolish the tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service, slash income and payroll taxes and impose a new business transfer tax. Cruzs wife, Heidi Cruz, is a Goldman Sachs executive in Houston. Clintons main benefactor is billionaire George Soros, a long-time patron of Democratic and humanitarian causes and chairman of Soros Fund Management. Soros alone is responsible for $7.3 million of the $11.7 million that has gone to Super PACs and other committees supporting Clinton. The hedge fund managers spokespersons either declined to comment or did not respond to queries from Reuters. But Whitney Tilson, a hedge fund manager who runs Kase Capital, said one reason fellow managers are spending more this election is Donald Trump, the front-runner for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. There are some pretty heated emotions about Donald Trump, said Tilson, who plans to support the Democratic Party nominee. Trump, who says he is self-funding his campaign, supports closing a loophole that lets some hedge fund managers pay less than the usual income tax rate on performance fees they get known as carried interest. Clinton supports this, too. The Managed Funds Association, an industry lobbying group, declined to comment on policy aims under the next president. There are other worries, too, about a Trump presidency.After months of campaigning and debates, Trumps economic and financial policy positions are still sketchy or unknown. A Trump presidency could bring tremendous uncertainty and instability, said Gregory Wawro, a political science professor at Columbia University.  Wawro speculated that Trumps popularity with blue-collar and middle-class voters could prompt the Republican Party to reassess an approach to taxes and economic issues that has favored top earners and major corporations in recent years.  The surge of hedge fund donations has had little effect on the Republican race so far. Cruz is running well behind Trump while U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who is seen by establishment Republicans as their best hope to stop Trump winning the nomination, is a distant third. Conservative Solutions, a Super PAC that backs Rubio, received $2.5 million from Paul Singer, the long-timeRepublican fundraiser who runs Elliott Management, and another $2.6 million in contributions from hedge fund manager Kenneth Griffin of Citadel Investment Group. Two other Republican candidates with major hedge fund backing, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, have dropped out of the race. Christies Super PAC, America Leads, received about $3 million from Steve Cohen of Point72 Asset Management, while Right to Rise, a PAC that supports Bush, drew $450,000 in donations from managers including Citadels Griffin, David Tepper of Appaloosa Management and Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital Management. In the Democratic race, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders has eschewed donations from Wall Street. He has racked up a string of wins in early state nominating contests with attacks on Wall Street and calls for a more equitable distribution of the countrys wealth. Overall, hedge fund contributions to 2016 presidential candidates and lawmakers and the PACs supporting them favored Republicans over Democrats by about 3 to 2.

Republicans sue State Department for Clinton emails,"(Reuters) - The Republican National Committee filed two lawsuits on Wednesday seeking to obtain emails related to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintons tenure as U.S. secretary of state. Clinton, front-runner to be her partys candidate in Novembers general election, has faced questions about her emails since it emerged a year ago that she used a private email account and a private server during her time in the post from 2009-2013. Clinton has apologized for the email arrangement, which is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but has said she did nothing wrong and believes the government will vindicate her. The RNC said it filed the lawsuits after the State Department failed to respond in a timely manner to a Freedom of Information Act request submitted in December. It sought the information to ensure the public has information to decide if Clinton is fit to serve as president, the RNC said in a statement. The first lawsuit seeks emails, BlackBerry Messenger or text messages between then-Secretary of State Clinton and several key senior aides, including her chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, and director of policy planning, Jake Sullivan. The second lawsuit seeks emails and other electronic exchanges between nearly a dozen State Department officials and any Clinton associate using one of more than a dozen different internet domain names. It covers the period between Feb. 1, 2013, when Clinton left the job, and Dec. 4, 2015. The request includes any emails to the State Department officials from Clintons campaign website, HillaryClinton.com, or the website of former President Bill Clintons foundation, ClintonFoundation.org. The suit also targets emails from domains like MediaMatters.org, a liberal non-profit group that seeks to counter what it believes is misleading conservative information in the U.S. media.

Rubio says he regrets getting personal with Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio voiced regret on Wednesday about making personal attacks against front-runner Donald Trump, a strategy that has failed to slow the New York billionaires momentum.Rubio, Trump, Ohio Governor John Kasich and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the four remaining Republican presidential candidates, participated in a round of Fox News-sponsored town hall events a day before they meet for another debate on Thursday in Miami. Rubio, whose campaign is fighting for survival after a series of disappointing performances in nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election, has drawn fire for a line of attack in recent weeks in which he got personal with Trump. He called him a con artist and said among other things that he had small hands, a charge that Trump took to mean as questioning the size of his manhood. Until Rubio got personal, the U.S. senator from Florida had largely stayed above the fray and had focused his assault on Trump from a policy standpoint. He told Fox News The Kelly File that if he had to do it over again, he would handle the issue differently. My kids were embarrassed by it. My wife didnt like it. I dont think it reflects good. Thats not who I am. Thats not what my campaign is going to be about or will ever be about again, Rubio said. Id do it differently  on the personal stuff. Im not telling you he didnt deserve it, but thats not who I am and thats not what I want to be, he added. Rubio, 44, fared poorly when Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho and Hawaii voted on Tuesday. He needs to win his home state of Florida next Tuesday or face calls for him to exit the race. He said opinion polls showing him lagging far behind Trump in Florida were not accurate. The fact of the matter is the only poll that counts is the one theyll take on Tuesday when they count the votes that these people are going to cast and were going to win in Florida, he said. Cruz, 45, looking to emerge as the main Trump alternative should Rubio and Kasich falter, said he would keep the focus of the campaign on substantive issues. I dont have any views on Donald Trumps anatomy, Cruz said at his Fox News town hall. Kasich, at his Fox News town hall, said he believed he had a path forward if he wins his home state of Ohio on Tuesday, but that it involved a convention fight when Republicans gather to officially pick their nominee in Cleveland in July. A contested convention would result if Trump, 69, does not win the required 1,237 delegates, forcing delegates to decide whether to back him at the convention or find a consensus candidate such as Kasich, 63. President Gerald Ford and challenger Ronald Reagan staged a spirited nomination fight at the 1976 Republican National Convention, but no Republican convention has gone beyond a single ballot since Thomas Deweys third-ballot win in 1948.  Trump, who has come under withering attack by mainstream Republicans for his statements on Muslims, illegal immigrants and trade policy, said at his Fox News town hall he had attracted many new voters to the Republican Party with his crossover appeal. He said establishment Republicans would be risking the energy he had brought to the race by trying to prevent him from winning. They would be so foolish to throw it away, he told host Sean Hannity.

White House interviewing five potential U.S. Supreme Court nominees: source,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is interviewing five potential nominees for the U.S. Supreme Court vacancy created by the death last month of Justice Antonin Scalia, a source familiar with the process told Reuters on Wednesday. The source said those under consideration were federal judges Sri Srinivasan, Jane Kelly, Ketanji Brown Jackson, Paul Watford and Merrick Garland. The five have been reported to be on the short list of potential nominees, but the source said they were the only ones currently under consideration. Outside groups have said that President Barack Obama is likely to consider someone who is a woman or a member of a racial minority and was previously confirmed to a judgeship by a strong majority in the U.S. Senate. The process of filling the spot that was held by Scalia, one of the courts most conservative justices, has ignited a partisan battle in Washington. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would not hold hearings on anyone nominated to the Supreme Court by Obama, a Democrat. Republicans who control the Senate do not want to see the court shift ideologically to the left and say the next justice should be picked by the winner of the Nov. 8 election.  Senate Democrats are demanding a vote on Obamas nomination. Kelly, who worked as a lawyer in Iowa, is considered a strong candidate because she has been supported by Republican Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which holds hearings on potential nominees.

U.S. court to re-examine decision striking down of Texas voter ID law,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A Texas law previously struck down requiring voters to show authorized identification before casting ballots will be re-examined, the U.S. Court for Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said on Wednesday.      The court, which said its full bench of judges will participate, did not set a date or elaborate on why it will hold the review of the law a three-judge panel from the court said in an August 2015 decision violated the U.S. Voting Rights Act through its discriminatory effects. The measure was signed into law in 2011 by then Texas Governor Rick Perry, a Republican, and has been in effect since  even as the legal challenges have wound their way through the courts. Plaintiffs have argued the law hits elderly and poorer voters, including minorities, hardest because they are less likely to have such identification. They contend the measure is used by Republicans as a way suppressing voters who typically align with Democrats.  The measure, which supporters say will prevent voter fraud, requires voters to present a photo identification such as a drivers license, passport or military ID card. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican welcomed the courts decision. Todays decision is a strong step forward in our efforts to defend the states Voter ID laws. Safeguarding the integrity of our elections is a primary function of state government and is essential to preserving our democratic process, he said in a statement. Critics contend that voter fraud is a miniscule problem overblown by Republicans for political purposes. Republicans contend voter fraud erodes the fabric of the democratic process. Civil rights groups have urged the court not to re-hear the case. U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos ruled in October 2014 that the law, which was challenged by the administration of President Barack Obama and civil rights groups, was unlawful under the Voting Rights Act and U.S. Constitution in part because it discriminates against minority voters. The Obama administration has been trying to counter a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June 2013 that overturned parts of the Voting Rights Act. That ruling freed several states, mostly in the South, from strict federal oversight. ",politicsNews,"March 10, 2016 ",1
"No Obama meeting with Fidel Castro, dissident talks on track: White House","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House has ruled out an encounter between President Barack Obama and revolutionary leader Fidel Castro in Cuba this month and is confident the Cuban government will not create obstacles to a meeting between Obama and dissidents in Havana, a top adviser said on Wednesday. Despite the goal of improving ties between former Cold War foes, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Obama would not use his trip to meet Cubas demands that he shutter Radio and TV Marti, U.S. broadcasters created to transmit anti-communist programing to the island nation. Obama plans to hold talks with Cuban President Raul Castro during his historic March 20-22 visit but will not meet with Castros brother, a legendary figure who took power in a 1959 revolution and led Cuba for 49 years. Weve had no discussion about that meeting taking place, and we certainly wouldnt seek it, Rhodes, who was one of the negotiators in secret talks that led to a thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations, told Reuters in an interview. Asked if a meeting was ruled out, Rhodes said: Yes. A meeting with the elder Castro could overshadow a trip that is meant to focus on the future of the U.S.-Cuba relationship rather than its troubled past. Castro, 89, stepped down from power after a series of health problems and rarely leaves his Havana home, though he occasionally meets visiting dignitaries. The White House has said previously it did not expect a Fidel Castro meeting to occur but did not say it was ruled out. The administration made clear when it set up Obamas trip that he would meet with anti-government dissidents in Havana despite the Cuban leaderships objections to what it sees as meddling in the countrys internal affairs.  Rhodes said the list of participants had not been finalized and the meeting would take place in a U.S. facility, which suggests the U.S. embassy or ambassadors residence.  That meeting would take place after official events with Raul Castro. Cuban dissidents in the past have reported being detained in their homes or picked up by police en route to major international events such as summits or papal visits, but Rhodes said he did not anticipate that happening for Obamas trip. We havent worked out the logistics, but ... they have not suggested that they will throw up those types of obstacles, he said, adding the United States would be watching whether Cuba detained or harassed activists in connection with the visit. Two of Cubas most prominent dissidents, Berta Soler and Jose Daniel Ferrer, were detained on Tuesday, according to dissident groups. Susan Rice, Obamas national security adviser, on Wednesday met with Cuban-American activists and U.S. human rights advocates and told them Obama would meet Cuban independent civil society representatives chosen by his aides, the White House said. Obamas Republican critics have accused him of playing down human rights concerns in order to pursue rapprochement with Cuba, which began in December 2014 and is now seen as a major piece of his foreign policy legacy. The Cuban government has done little to reciprocate for a series of U.S. measures that eased restrictions on U.S.-Cuba travel and trade. It is unclear whether it will make any large gestures during Obamas visit, the first by a sitting U.S. president since 1928. Rhodes countered that the outreach to Cuba was aimed at helping the local population while opening up commercial opportunities for Americans. The administration plans to roll out further measures next week to chip away at decades-old restrictions to commerce. Obama also wants to lift the embargo on Cuba, which is only possible through congressional action. Republican leaders in Congress oppose such a move.  Other differences remain. The Obama administration is not considering returning the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay to the Cuban government, and Rhodes said it would not make changes to the Radio and TV Marti broadcasters at this time.  Both issues are irritants that the Cubans consider obstacles to full normalization with Washington.  The Cubans dont like Radio Marti and TV Marti for sure, Rhodes said. Theres only so much you can get to. The U.S. government launched Radio Marti in 1983 and later added TV Marti to transmit anti-communist news and information into Cuba, where the government has a monopoly on the media. A decision on whether to put an end to a U.S. program that encourages Cuban doctors and nurses on overseas assignments to defect was not tied to the trip either, Rhodes said.

Fate of lawsuit brought by Trump model to be decided this month," NEW YORK (Reuters) - A judge will decide by the end of this month whether to proceed with a proposed class action lawsuit filed by a Jamaican fashion model against Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trumps modeling agency, the judges office said.  Alexia Palmer accuses Trump Model Management LLC of lying to the federal government in its work-visa application that said she would be paid a $75,000-a-year salary while living in the United States, according to court documents.RECOMMENDED: Iran tests more missiles, says capable of reaching Israel Instead, according to court papers, Palmer received a total of $3,880.75 during the three years she was under contract with the agency. The complaint alleges fraudulent misrepresentation and violations of U.S. immigration and labor laws. It asks for $225,000 in back pay.  The suit was originally filed in October 2014. A decision on a pending motion by Trump Model Management to dismiss is expected by the end of March, the clerk for Judge Analisa Torres, who is presiding over the case in the U.S District Court, Southern District, told Reuters.  If Torres rules the case can proceed, it could revive attention on Trumps foreign labor practices at a time when the celebrity billionaires rise in American politics has riveted the worlds attention.  Trumps lawyers have called the case frivolous and without merit. In court documents, they said Palmer wasnt an employee and was more than adequately compensated for a very brief stint as a fashion model, which they say amounted to less than 10 days of work over three years.  Reuters could not independently confirm that assertion.  At the end of the day, this model just didnt have a successful career, and we fully expect to win, said Lawrence Rosen, a lawyer for Trump Model Management.  Although Trump owns the modeling agency, the suit does not name him. Trumps campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said in a statement that Trump Model Managements treatment of Palmer was in line with standard practice in the modeling industry.  Palmers lawyer, Naresh Gehi, says his client was cheated of earnings and seduced by a life of glamour that never materialized. The visa application the company filed with the government requires that people are paid the full amount, Gehi said. Its a requirement.  Palmer, who was 17 when she came to New York in 2011, was not available to comment.  Sylvia Ayass, a lawyer who has worked with models on visas like Palmers, said agencies typically pay what they state on visa applications.  Trump has won Republican frontrunner status in the 2016 election in large part by positioning himself as a champion of the American worker who will deport illegal immigrants, build a wall with Mexico and do away with the off shoring of U.S. jobs.  This is not the first time Trumps labor practices have drawn criticism. A Reuters story published in August revealed that Trumps companies sought to import at least 1,100 workers on temporary visas since 2000. Of those, 250 were filed for foreign fashion models, according to the Reuters analysis of federal Department of Labor data.  Using a federal visa program called H-1B that allows U.S. employers to hire specialized foreign labor, Trumps modeling agency offered Palmer at least $75,000 per year for three years. It listed that salary on her H-1B visa application in 2011, according to the court documents reviewed by Reuters.  Its not the industry norm to use H-1B visas, which are usually reserved for highly skilled specialized labor like engineers, programmers and medical specialists. O-1 visas are more common, modeling agency lawyers and executives said. The O-1 is typically used by artists and athletes.  Though H-1B use is rare, a Reuters analysis found that in the past three years, modeling agencies have submitted 181 applications for H-1B visas for foreign models. Of those, 173 stated that the model would be paid an hourly wage, ranging from as little as $8.40 an hour to as much as $500 an hour.  The Trump Model yearly salary listed in the federal database of H-1B applications was the outlier.  Rosen, the lawyer for Trump Model Management, said the $75,000 a year figure was simply a guess, not a guarantee.  Under that contract, Palmer agreed to promptly reimburse Trump Model Management for any and all costs and expenses that the agency incurred relating to her modeling.  According to the suit, the agreement stipulated that Trump Model Management would take a 20 percent cut of Palmers earnings but instead took 80 percent by deducting charges for everything from postage to walking lessons to mobile phone costs and limousine rides, as well as $4,000 in administrative fees, according to court documents.  The suit said it was seeking class-action status to represent other models who believe they were misled and underpaid after coming to the United States with sponsorship from Trumps modeling agency.

Pennsylvania gun control advocates challenge law on city gun rules,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Pennsylvania gun control advocates on Wednesday asked the states top court to knock down a 2014 law allowing gun-rights lobbying groups to sue cities that adopt gun restrictions and recoup legal costs if they prevail. Firearms advocates, including the National Rifle Association, contend the law is necessary to prevent gun owners from becoming ensnared by a patchwork of municipal ordinances that violate their right to bear arms. Gun control advocates challenged the law on a technicality - that it passed as part of what they called an unrelated piece of legislation. These two bills were cobbled together for political expediency at the end of the legislative session, Martin Black, representing five Democratic lawmakers who sued to overturn the law, told the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.More than 80 towns across Pennsylvania repealed gun laws - ranging from requirements that owners report lost or stolen firearms to bans on guns in public parks - rather than face hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal bills to defend ordinances that were seldom enforced. Five municipalities, including Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, have faced lawsuits under the law. The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the right to bear arms, and efforts to regulate gun ownership are often fiercely contested. Wednesdays arguments focused on the tortured legislative history of the bill and whether its passage violated a provision of the states Constitution that specifies that laws must focus on a single issue. A lower court found last June that the passage was unconstitutional because Republican lawmakers tucked the firearms legislation into a bill dealing with scrap metal. That bill passed on the final day of the 2014 legislative session and was so rushed that Republican Governor Tom Corbett signed the wrong bill.  Republican legislators said at the time that the language was necessary because towns were ignoring laws that made it a criminal offense for towns to pass gun restrictions. What does suing the city over a firearms matter have to do with the theft of copper wire? asked a skeptical Justice David Wecht. Attorney Nick Orloff, arguing on behalf of Republican legislators, said both bills dealt with crime prevention. Its meant to deter crime, Orloff said. But Shira Goodman, executive director of CeaseFire PA, scoffed at that idea. Say the city of Philadelphia passes a soda tax, Goodman said. If I dont drink soda, I dont get to sue because I didnt pay the tax. ",politicsNews,"March 9, 2016 ",1
Clinton's surprise Michigan loss exposes risks for her on trade,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clintons unexpected defeat in Michigan has laid bare growing voter anger over international trade, raising warning flags for her ahead of a possible presidential election showdown against Republican front-runner Donald Trump. Trump has built his campaign on pledges to scrap international trade deals and do more to protect American workers from foreign competition, tapping the same groundswell of discontent that propelled Clintons rival Bernie Sanders to victory in the Midwestern state on Tuesday. Clinton remains heavily favored to win the Democratic nomination. But the setback in Michigan could signal further troubles in upcoming primaries in other Rust Belt states such as Ohio, forcing her further to the left on economic issues and possibly influencing her choice for an eventual running mate, strategists said. The backlash against 20 years of trade liberalization has stalled the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), a sweeping Pacific trade deal backed by President Barack Obama and threatens to stymie the trade agenda for years to come. Its politically radioactive to support free trade right now, said Greg Valliere, a Washington analyst for Horizon Investments, a financial firm. Clintons troubles with her partys left wing  and with white, working class voters more generally  may steer her toward a trade skeptic such as Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio as a vice presidential running mate, said Democratic strategist Steve Jarding. Political pundits had expected Clinton to pick someone to increase her appeal to Hispanic or other minority voters, such as U.S. Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro. Sanders, 74, is unlikely to end up as Clintons running mate, partly due to his age, Democrats said. Both Sanders, a democratic socialist, and billionaire Trump have harnessed anti-trade sentiment in their insurgent White House bids, criticizing deals like NAFTA as job killers that have depressed the living standards of working Americans. Exit polls from Michigan, a hub of the U.S. auto industry, show widespread voter skepticism on trade that may have helped Sanders and Trump win their respective party primaries.  She made a fundamental mistake early on in this campaign to try to stay in the center, Democratic strategist Steve Jarding said of Clinton. This cycle, there is no center. Sanders campaigned heavily against foreign trade in a state that has been hammered by overseas competition since the 1980s. Some 58 percent of his supporters in Michigan exit polls said that trade takes away U.S. jobs, while a slight majority - 53 percent - of Clinton backers said trade creates U.S. jobs. The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, estimates that Michigan would lose 5 percent of its jobs if TPP were to take effect, the highest proportion of any state. Gary Hunley, a substitute teacher in Dearborn, Michigan, said he believed Clinton was partially to blame for stagnant wages because NAFTA was enacted under her husband Bill Clintons presidency in the 1990s. She was not a passive first lady, Hunley said. Clintons stance on trade is more nuanced than Trumps and Sanders. After NAFTA was enacted, she voted against a free-trade deal with Central America while serving as a U.S. senator in the following decade. As Obamas secretary of state, Clinton helped negotiate the TPP with Japan, Vietnam and other Pacific Rim countries.  As a presidential candidate, Clinton has said after reading the final language of the deal she would vote against it because it does not adequately protect U.S. workers.  Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters Wednesday there were no plans to adjust her stance and that he would put Secretary Clinton up against any candidate in this race on trade, including Trump.  Despite backing by the Obama administration, Republican lawmakers and many business groups, Republican leaders in Congress have shown no sign that they will bring TPP up for a  vote this year. The Obama administration says the deal has high labor and environmental standards that were not part of NAFTA. Im not sure that has fully been absorbed in the public mindset, U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice told Reuters. [L1N16H1VJ] The deal may fare no better under the next president. Sanders and Trump oppose TPP, and Senator Ted Cruz, who is in second place in the Republican contest, has said he would not vote for it this year. Theyve listened to the public and politicians have caught up with the public on this, Brown, the Ohio Democratic senator, told Reuters. The evidence that the TPP would help the U.S. economy much is less than conclusive. The Peter G. Peterson Institute, a pro-trade think tank, estimates that it would boost economic growth by just 0.5 percent after 15 years. The deal would not boost employment overall, but would result in a churn of 53,700 jobs lost and created each year, and it would boost incomes by 0.5 percent, the institute found.  Another estimate by the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University found the trade deal would slow growth by 0.54 percent after 10 years and cost 448,000 jobs in the United States.

Florida lawmakers: Couples can move in without saying 'I do',"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (Reuters) - Florida lawmakers on Wednesday gave the thumbs-up to living together without being married, sending to the governor a bill repealing the states Reconstruction-era ban on cohabitation by unmarried couples.  The old law made it illegal to lewdly and lasciviously live together without being married to each other - language that presumably differentiated between romantic couples sharing a bed and non-romantic roommates splitting the rent. In either case, sponsors said, it is a law that is impossible to enforce but dangerous to have on the books. You shouldnt have statutes that are not being enforced, said state Representative Michelle Rehwinkel Vasilinda, a Tallahassee Democrat and bill sponsor. Youd have to arrest a half-million people, if we enforced this. The repeal statute leaves in place a section of the 1868 law making it a misdemeanor to engage in open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior, regardless of marital status. It is difficult to determine if anyone gets arrested for cohabitation, since the offense is combined in the state with public lewdness, said Rehwinkel Vasilinda, a law school instructor.  But the law could be used in a discriminatory manner if a jealous ex-spouse or prosecutor wanted to harass a person or unmarried couple, she said. The cohabitation ban is the latest in a string of antiquated and rarely-if-ever-enforced sex laws being repealed across the country - either by new laws, referendum, or court action, the most notable being bans on same-sex intercourse struck down by the courts in recent years.  If Floridas repeal passes the governors muster, only Mississippi and Michigan will be the holdouts on laws requiring couples to marry before sharing roof and bed, according to a staff analysis of the Florida bill.  The bill was also sponsored by state Senator Eleanor Sobel, a Hollywood Democrat.  The repeal earned the overwhelming support of the Florida lawmakers, with a unanimous vote in the state Senate and five dissenters in the House.  Among them was Representative Jennifer Sullivan, a Republican from Mount Dora, who said she ran on a pro-family platform and could not vote to legalize cohabitation. Based on my own faith and what I believe, I voted accordingly, she said. My faith affects everything I do and who I am, so Im just being consistent with who I said I was as a candidate.

"U.S., Canada put pipeline fight in the past with state dinner","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is eager to turn the page on the years-long fight over a crude oil pipeline with Canada and celebrate its close economic and security ties with its northern neighbor, U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said on Wednesday. Trade between the United States and Canada and joint efforts to curb climate change will loom large on the agenda for the meeting between President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Washington on Thursday. It will be followed by a star-studded state dinner meant to recognize the importance of the bilateral relationship, the first state dinner to honor Canada in 19 years. Trudeaus Liberals came to power in November by ousting right-wing Conservative leader Stephen Harper, whose ties with Washington deteriorated as he hectored Obama over the Keystone XL pipeline. President Barack Obama blocked the project last year, a victory for environmentalists who had campaigned against the pipeline. The spat is in the past, Rice said. In any bilateral relationship, there are going to be issues of difference and occasional friction, she told Reuters in an interview.  The complexity and the breadth and the depth of the U.S-Canada relationship is such that no single issue can overshadow the totality of the relationship, she said. Obama and Trudeau will discuss the next steps for the Beyond the Border initiative, a plan to speed travel and trade, Rice said. With the longest peaceful border and $2 billion a day in trade in both directions, we have an enormous shared stake in a border that is open for business and open for travel - and safe, Rice said. Trudeau campaigned to strengthen ties with the United States, but also promised he would pull out six fighter jets from the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Rice said the White House is satisfied with steps that Trudeau took to beef up training, surveillance and other support to the coalition. Taken as a whole, we view the Canadian stepped-up contribution to the counter-ISIL campaign as being very, very valuable and welcome, Rice said, using an acronym for Islamic State. The White House has also watched closely as Trudeau welcomed 25,000 Syrian refugees to Canada in four months. Weve seen thus far that Canada is taking very seriously its responsibility to its own citizens and to our common security to be vigilant as it welcomes these new refugees, Rice said.

Florida legislature approves controversial abortion restrictions,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (Reuters) - Florida legislators on Wednesday approved abortion restrictions that include requirements for physicians similar to a Texas law currently under review by the Supreme Court and prohibited state funding for routine care at abortion clinics. The measure imposes regulations that could force clinics to close, provider Planned Parenthood said. Supporters argue it aims to protect womens health, while opponents called it an attack on groups assisting women in terminating pregnancies. Lets get Florida out of the abortion business, said State Senator Aaron Bean, a Republican from Jacksonville, during a heated debate. Thats what this bill does. The legislation passed largely along party lines in the Florida House and Senate, both controlled by Republicans. Republican Governor Rick Scott did not immediately say if he will sign it. Florida is among many states adopting new abortion laws as conservatives seek to chip away at the U.S. Supreme Courts landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision to legalize abortion. Another Florida law passed last year requiring women to wait 24 hours before getting an abortion recently took effect. The newly passed legislation requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, a type of formal affiliation that can be difficult to obtain, while tightening rules on disposal of aborted fetal tissue. Clinics would have to meet the more stringent safety standards of ambulatory surgery centers and also face annual inspections. The legislation blocks state funding for low-income women receiving routine care, such as sexually transmitted disease screening and birth control, at clinics that perform abortions.   What were doing is pulling the rug out from under women who have enough problems in life, said State Senator Gwen Margolis, a Miami Democrat.   The bill is similar to a 2013 Texas law that included admitting privilege requirements for doctors and stringent regulations for clinic buildings. It is under review by the Supreme Court, considering its first major abortion case in years. A ruling is expected by late June. Florida would, in one bill, do the damage it took Texas years to inflict on women, said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in a statement. The high court has temporarily blocked a similar Louisiana law that had closed clinics in the state.  The Florida legislation would not stop anyone from ending a pregnancy, argued state senator Kelli Stargel, a Republican from Lakeland. This legislation makes certain that our limited taxpayer dollars are not being used to support organizations that provide elective abortions, she said. ",politicsNews,"March 9, 2016 ",1
Senators close to finishing encryption penalties legislation: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Technology companies could face civil penalties for refusing to comply with court orders to help investigators access encrypted data under draft legislation nearing completion in the U.S. Senate, sources familiar with continuing discussions told Reuters on Wednesday.   The long-awaited legislation from Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, may be introduced as soon as next week, one of the sources said.  It would expose companies like Apple Inc, which is fighting a magistrate judges order to unlock an iPhone connected to the mass-shooting in San Bernardino, California,  to contempt of court proceedings and related penalties, the source said.  Senators are expected to circulate the draft bill among interested parties next week and hope to introduce it soon after, though a timetable is not final, the source said. The Senators proposal would not seek criminal penalties, as some media reports have stated, the sources said. The controversial proposal faces an uphill climb in a gridlocked Congress during an election year and would likely be opposed by Silicon Valley.  Tech companies have largely supported Apple in its legal fight against the Justice Department, which is seeking access to a phone used by Rizwan Farook, one of two shooters in the San Bernardino attack last December in which 14 were killed and 22 wounded. It is particularly unlikely the proposal will gain traction in the U.S. House of Representatives, which staked out positions strongly supporting digital privacy in the wake of revelations about government-sanctioned surveillance of communications by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. Last year, amid stiff private sector opposition, the White House backed away from pushing for legislation to require U.S. technology firms to provide investigators with mechanisms to overcome encryption protections.  But the issue found renewed life after the shootings in San Bernardino and Paris. An August email from Robert Litt, the top U.S. intelligence community lawyer, obtained by the Washington Post, noted that momentum on the issue could turn in the event of a terrorist attack or criminal event where strong encryption can be shown to have hindered law enforcement. Separately, Democratic Senator Mark Warner and Republican Representative Michael McCaul last week introduced legislation to create a national commission to further explore solutions to the so-called going dark problem, where strong encryption has made it more difficult for law enforcement to access communications belonging to criminal suspects.

Kerry says no pressing need for more U.S.-Canada pipeline: CBC,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - The United States sees no urgent need for a new energy pipeline between Canada and the United States, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday, in a broadcast interview ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The U.S. government will evaluate new proposals individually, but is looking at new, cleaner technologies, Kerry said to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. We have some 300 pipelines, its not as if were pipeline-less, Kerry said, according to a story on the broadcasters website. Things change, technologies in particular help to change things, and we need to push the technology curve. Trudeau will attend a state dinner on Thursday, becoming the first Canadian leader to do so since 1997, as the two countries aim to fix a frayed relationship. U.S. President Barack Obama last year blocked the cross-border Keystone XL crude oil pipeline proposed by TransCanada Corp in a victory for environmentalists. ",politicsNews,"March 9, 2016 ",1
Cuba issues bristling editorial ahead of Obama visit,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba said it would welcome President Barack Obama to Havana later this month, but the Communist government had no intention of changing its policies in exchange for normal relations with the United States. In a long editorial on Wednesday in Communist Party newspaper Granma and other official media, Cuba demanded Washington cease meddling in its internal affairs and said Obama could do more to change U.S. policy. The White House brushed off the piece and defended the presidents trip next month as an opportunity to engage both with Cubas government and its citizens.    Obama will visit on March 20-22, 15 months after he and Cuban President Raul Castro agreed to end more than five decades of Cold War-era animosity.  They have restored diplomatic ties, and Obama has relaxed a trade sanctions and travel restrictions, leading Republican opponents and some of the presidents fellow Democrats to question whether Washington was offering too much without reciprocation from Havana. But the editorial made it clear that Cuba still has a long list of grievances with the United States, starting with the comprehensive trade embargo. Obama wants to rescind the embargo but Republican leadership in Congress has blocked the move. Cuba also objected to U.S. support for its political dissidents, whom some Americans consider champions of human rights but whom the Cuban government views as an unrepresentative minority funded by U.S. interests. (The United States) should abandon the pretense of fabricating an internal political opposition, paid for with money from U.S. taxpayers, the nearly 3,000-word editorial said.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters that Obamas long agenda includes visiting with political opposition of the Cuban government and standing up for, in a very tangible way, the universal human rights of the Cuban people. Obama visit will be only the second by a U.S. president and the first since the 1959 revolution led by Fidel Castro that overthrew a pro-American government. The editorial said Cuba no one should assume Cuba had to renounce any of its principles or cede the slightest bit in its defense to do so. The two countries have also negotiated greater cooperation on law enforcement and environmental issues and agreed to resume scheduled commercial flights and postal services. Obama has removed Cuba from a list of state sponsors of terrorism. The editorial acknowledged Obama had taken positive steps but criticized their limited nature and the existence of other regulations and intimidation caused by the overall blockade that has been in force for more than 50 years.

Missouri Senate Republicans pass anti-gay religious amendment,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A 39-hour Democratic filibuster in the Missouri Senate ended on Wednesday when Republicans forced a vote and approved a proposal to prohibit sanctions against groups and wedding vendors that discriminate against same-sex couples for religious reasons. The resolution to amend the states constitution passed 23-9 after the majority Republican caucus used a parliamentary maneuver to end the filibuster, which began at 4:00 p.m. CST on Monday, said Lauren Hieger, communications director for the Missouri Senate Majority Caucus. The amendment must be voted on again in the Senate next week before passing to the lower house, where Republicans have a majority, and then to the states voters, Hieger said. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat, applauded the effort by the Senate minority to block the resolution. Rewriting our states constitution to condone discrimination would be contrary to our values and harmful to our economy, Nixon said in a statement on Wednesday. The legislation is among a series of measures introduced around the country by conservatives in response to last years U.S. Supreme Court legalization of same-sex marriage. The measures seek to protect religious groups and companies from being fined or punished if they decline to provide services such as wedding cakes or flowers to same-sex couples. Republicans who backed the amendment said it was about religious freedom, but Democrats said it would enshrine discrimination in the states constitution. Given their minority position in both chambers of Missouris General Assembly, Democrats chose to filibuster, debating overnight on Monday and Tuesday to block the initiative. Inspired by senators heroic stand against discrimination in #MO. The nation is watching & cheering you on! Nixon tweeted on Tuesday night. In our pluralistic society, we should have room to respect the religious freedom of Missourians, Republican Senator Bob Onder, who sponsored the bill, told reporters at a news conference on Wednesday morning. He said the language of the bill was modified in a compromise on Tuesday to narrowly define wedding vendors. The American Civil Liberties Union civil rights group said it would work to fight the bill in Missouris House of Representatives. This amendment raises serious constitutional concerns because it singles out same-sex couples for discrimination, Jeffrey Mittman, executive director of ACLU of Missouri, said in a statement.

U.S. senator does not expect Pakistan F-16 sale to be blocked,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on Wednesday he does not expect an upcoming vote on a $700 million sale of F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan to keep the deal from going ahead. However, he said there was still discussion of whether U.S. taxpayer funds could be used to finance the purchase. President Barack Obamas administration announced on Feb. 12 that it had approved the sale of the Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) aircraft as well as radars and other equipment to Pakistan. It drew immediate criticism from India and concern from some members of Congress.  Republican Senator Rand Paul in late February invoked legislation known as the Arms Export Control Act in the hope of stopping the sale by passing a Resolution of Disapproval, calling Pakistan an uncertain ally. Cardin told reporters he opposed Pauls resolution and expected it would fail, with the chambers Republican and Democratic leaders opposing it. The measure could be taken up by the Senate as soon as Thursday. Cardin said lawmakers had concerns about Pakistans nuclear program, commitment to fighting terrorist organizations and cooperation in the Afghanistan peace process but generally supported the sale. It was not controversial that Pakistan needs to modernize its air force and its counter insurgency and counter-terrorism activities, particularly in the mountainous territory of the border with Afghanistan, he said. Congress is currently considering a request to reprogram some funds, in other words, use them for a different purpose than allocated in a budget bill, to help finance the deal. Cardin said he was not yet prepared to make a judgment on whether U.S. taxpayer funds should be used to help Pakistan with the purchase.     ",politicsNews,"March 9, 2016 ",1

FBI hints Iran now cooperating in hunt for missing former agent,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation hinted on Wednesday that authorities in Iran had recently been trying to help locate Robert Levinson, a retired FBI agent who disappeared exactly nine years ago after traveling to an Iranian resort island to meet a fugitive from U.S. justice. We are encouraged by recent cooperation between the government of Iran and the United States, and believe that our ability to locate Bob and reunite him with his family requires a shared commitment by the Iranian government, the FBIs Washington Field Office said in a prepared statement. The statement quoted FBI Director James Comey saying that his agency was doing everything in our power to investigate all leads.  The FBI statement did not elaborate further. The White House also said that finding Levinson remains a top priority for the United States, but added that the U.S. would continue to call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to provide assistance in his case, as agreed to as part of the prisoner exchange finalized earlier this year. Five Americans were released by Iran in January to coincide with the lifting of economic sanctions in return for curbs on Tehrans nuclear program. The White House offered clemency to seven Iranians who were convicted or facing trial in the United States. Levinsons family continued to urge the U.S. government to press Iran for his release. In a statement, Levinsons wife, Christine, said: Weneed the United States government and the country of Iran to work together to resolve what happened to Bob and return him safely to his family. Levinson disappeared after flying from Dubai to Kish Island in the Gulf in March 2007. There he met with Daoud Salahuddin, an American Islamic militant who fled to Iran while facing charges in the murder of an Iranian embassy official based in Washington. Levinson, working then as a private investigator, was seeking information on alleged corruption involving former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and his family, said sources familiar with his work. Months after he disappeared, U.S. government sources acknowledged that Levinson also maintained an unorthodox contractual relationship with the analytical branch of the Central Intelligence Agency. A handful of CIA officials were forced out of the agency and several more were disciplined after an internal agency investigation. The Iranian government has never publicly acknowledged any role in Levinsons abduction, though at the time of his disappearance a government-affiliated media outlet broadcast a story saying he was in the hands of Iranian security forces. Some FBI investigators strongly believe Levinson is still alive, while officials at other U.S. agencies believe he died some time ago. ",politicsNews,"March 9, 2016 ",1

U.N. torture envoy concerned at water-boarding rhetoric in U.S. race,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. torture investigator voiced concern on Wednesday at calls by some Republican candidates in the U.S. presidential race to authorize water-boarding in interrogating detainees, noting that it was illegal under domestic and international law. Republican candidate Donald Trump softened his stance on torture last Friday, saying he would not order the U.S. military to break international laws on how to treat terrorism suspects. The night before, he indicated he might order U.S. military to break the law on interrogation tactics, including waterboarding. Trumps rival and number two in the Republican primaries, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, said last month he would only allow limited use of the practice. He said he didnt believe waterboarding met the international definition for torture. Candidates in the United States have again discussed whether waterboarding is torture or not and have actually promised to bring it back and to bring even harsher techniques, Juan Mendez, U.N. special rappporteur on torture, told a news briefing in Geneva. The Bush administration allowed the use of waterboarding - the practice of pouring water over a cloth covering a detainees face to mimic the sensation of drowning - around conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. President Barack Obama banned it days after taking office in 2009. The Bush administration itself had withdrawn the torture memos when it was discovered that these things were happening as a matter of policy, Mendez said. Even the Republican administration had already recognized that these things are illegal. They are illegal as a matter of international law, they are illegal as a matter of constitutional law in the United States, they are illegal as a matter of military law...and they are immoral anyway, he said. Speaking as a U.S. citizen, rather than in his U.N. role, he said: Yes, I think the damage in the standing of the United States as a law-abiding nation and as an example to other states to fight crime and terrorism within the strictures of the rule of law is very seriously damaged by this kind of rhetoric. The Senate Intelligence Committee released a report in 2014, despite the objection of Republicans, that detailed what it called torture tactics used by the Central Intelligence Agency, including extensive use of waterboarding.

Sanders campaign sues Ohio for not allowing youth votes in primary,"(Reuters) - Bernie Sanders Democratic presidential campaign has sued Ohios secretary of state in federal court over what it calls an unconstitutional attempt to prevent young people from voting in the states March 15 primary election. It is an outrage that the secretary of state in Ohio is going out of his way to keep young people  significantly African-American young people, Latino young people  from participating, the U.S. senator from Vermont said in a statement released on Tuesday. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Columbus and  joined by six Ohio 17-year-olds, alleged that a directive by Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted would arbitrarily discriminate against young voters. Citing U.S. Census figures, it said such voters were more likely to be black or Latino than older groups of voters. Sanders, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 election, has attracted support from young voters but has lagged behind rival Hillary Clinton in winning votes among minorities. Ohio is one of more than 20 states where 17-year-olds who will be 18 by the time of the general election are allowed to vote in primaries, the campaign statement said. Husted ruled last December that those voters would not be allowed to participate in the presidential primary. He denied there had been any changes to voting rules.  We are following the same rules Ohio has operated under in past primaries, under both Democrat and Republican administrations. There is nothing new here, Husted said on Twitter. If you are going to be 18 by the November election, you can vote, just not on every issue.  He said that 17-year-olds were not permitted to elect candidates, which is what voters are doing in a primary when they elect delegates to represent them at their political partys national convention.

Obama starts interviewing candidates for Supreme Court vacancy: NPR,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama has started to interview candidates for the U.S. Supreme Court to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last month, National Public Radio reported on Tuesday, citing sources close to the process. Among the interviewees are Chief Judge Merrick Garland of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia; Judge Sri Srinivasan of the same court; Judge Paul Watford of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals based in San Francisco; Judge Jane Kelly of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals based in St. Louis; and U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who serves in Washington, D.C., NPR reported.

Suspect in shooting of Idaho pastor arrested,"(Reuters) - A man suspected of shooting an Idaho pastor who led a prayer at a rally for U.S. Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz was arrested on Tuesday and was facing attempted murder charges, police said. Kyle Odom, 30, was taken into custody in Washington D.C. in connection with the Sunday afternoon shooting of Pastor Tim Remington outside the Altar Church, Coeur dAlene Police Department Chief Lee White said in a late Tuesday news conference. Odom was apprehended by Secret Service officers after he tossed several items, including flash drives, over the fence of the White House, White said. The items thrown by Odom were deemed non-hazardous, the U.S. Secret Service said in a statement.  The attack on the pastor is the latest in a spate of highly publicized shootings in the United States that have made gun control an issue in the presidential race. Remington had led a prayer at a Cruz rally on Saturday and was shot by Odom, an ex-marine, the next day in the church parking lot in a preplanned attack, police said. The senior pastor was shot six times, including in the skull, after Sunday morning service, John Padula, outreach pastor at the church told Reuters. Remington regained consciousness on Monday evening as a candlelight vigil for his recovery was underway, Padula said. He opened one eye and gave me a thumbs up, Padula said, adding that Remington does not have feeling in his right arm but appears to be improving. Without God, there is no way hed be here. There is no apparent connection between the shooting and Remingtons appearance at the Cruz rally, Padula noted.  Cruz, an outspoken supporter of gun rights, could not be reached for comment on Tuesday, but a campaign spokeswoman told NBC News on Monday that they were praying for Remingtons recovery. Odom flew from Boise, Idaho to Washington D.C., on March 7, White said. An investigation into his plans was ongoing. The police chief, who previously said Odom had a history of mental illness, read a statement from Odoms family saying they were thankful for his safe apprehension. Local broadcaster KXLY reported that a Facebook page linked with Odom, who police said suffered from mental illness, was updated on Tuesday with a statement claiming that Remington was part of an ancient Martian civilization that ruled Earth.

Ryan says U.S. Congress will press for new sanctions against Iran,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday that lawmakers would continue to press for new sanctions against Tehran until the regime ends its violent, provocative behavior against the U.S. and our allies. Ryan, whose Republican party opposed the landmark nuclear agreement the Obama administration and five other world powers reached with Tehran last year, said Irans latest reported missile test violated international law. Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) test-fired several ballistic missiles on Tuesday, state television said, challenging a United Nations resolution and drawing the threat of a diplomatic response from the United States. U.S. and French officials had earlier said a missile test by Iran would violate U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, which calls on Iran not to conduct any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Several Republican lawmakers called for more U.S. sanctions in response, but there were no immediate plans to introduce new legislation. The House last month passed a measure that would have limited President Barack Obamas ability to lift sanctions under the nuclear pact, but there are no plans for the Senate to take up the legislation, which Obama is expected to veto. Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said his staff was working on an alternative that could win enough support to pass the Senate, but which would require Democratic support. Were having discussions right now and trying to see what type of legislation is passable, he told Reuters. ",politicsNews,"March 8, 2016 ",1
Trump presidency would not hurt 2024 Olympics bid-LA mayor,"BEVERLY HILLS, Calif (Reuters) - Even as U.S. presidential hopeful Donald Trump raises concerns among world leaders, the mayor of Los Angeles is confident that whoever reaches the White House will not hurt his citys chances of landing the 2024 Olympics. This is something that transcends politics, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said at the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) media summit on Tuesday. Sports doesnt ask what your party affiliation is. When the dust settles on these presidential campaigns and we have a new president he or she will squarely be behind Los Angeles bid to bring these Games back to the U.S. This is something that breaks down walls and something that brings us together. Making that pitch to the International Olympic Committee, who will select a 2024 host in 2017, could prove challenging if Trump wins the U.S. presidency in November and follows through on his plans to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and ban Muslims from entering the United States. Los Angeles is up against European glamor cities Paris, Rome and Budapest in the race to host the 2024 Summer Games. USOC chairman Larry Probst conceded that at a time when Los Angeles is throwing out a welcome mat to the world the anti-immigration rhetoric being put forward by some presidential candidates will not make the challenge any easier. At the end of the day this is about building positive relationships with the IOC membership, Probst said after a USOC board meeting where they were briefed by LA24 officials. There are extraneous things we cant control. We have to work as hard as we can at building those relationships with the voting members. The USOC has felt the sting from an international backlash before as New Yorks bid for the 2012 Summer Games and Chicagos attempt to land the 2016 Olympics were soundly rejected, much of that attributed to a strong anti-American sentiment within the IOC at the time. Our relationship within the IOC was not terrific if you look back six or seven years ago and (we) have worked really hard to rebuild those relationships, said Probst. That process is well underway and I think we are in a much better place than where we were a few years ago. The feedback has been positive across the board. I have heard nothing but compliments about everything so far. Countries bidding to host and Olympics have counted on their leaders to put them over the top. Russian President Vladimir Putin led his countrys bid for the 2014 Sochi Winter Games while British Prime Minister Tony Blair went to Singapore to trumpet Londons successful bid for 2012 Olympics. Politicians, if they are good, reflect the people they represent and I know how the American people feel about the Olympics and I know how they feel about Olympians and Paralympians, said Garcetti. I know that the Paralympic Games and Olympic Games is something that touches our hearts and any good President is going to follow with that spirit. ",politicsNews,"March 9, 2016 ",1
Attorney General Lynch asks not to be considered for Supreme Court vacancy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch asked not to be considered as a nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last month, the Justice Department said on Tuesday. Lynch, 56, was rumored to be under consideration by Democratic President Barack Obama. She is held in high regard within the administration, received bipartisan support for her nomination as attorney general and would be the first black woman to serve on the Supreme Court. Given the urgent issues before the Department of Justice, she asked not to be considered for the position, the department said in a statement. In recent weeks, other names have emerged on Obamas short list, including Sri Srinivasan, Jane Kelly and Paul Watford, all of whom serve as federal appeals court judges.  In an interview with Fox News last week, Lynch responded to speculation she was being vetted for the job. I havent had those conversations. Im very happy with my job, Lynch said.  Justice Department spokeswoman Melanie Newman said that while Lynch was deeply grateful for the support of those who suggested her as a high court nominee, she is honored to serve as attorney general, and she is fully committed to carrying out the work of the Department of Justice for the remainder of her term.   The process of filling the spot that was held by Scalia,  one of the courts most conservative justices, has ignited a partisan battle in Washington. Republicans who control the U.S. Senate do not want to see the court shift ideologically to the left and have said they will not hold a vote on Obamas nominee. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the next Supreme Court justice should be chosen by the winner of the Nov. 8 presidential election.  ",politicsNews,"March 8, 2016 ",1
Senator Shelby starts to break banking nominee logjam,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby on Tuesday started to ease the backlog of 16 Obama administration nominees stalled before the panel, scheduling a March 15 confirmation hearing for two Securities and Exchange Commission nominees. The move follows Shelbys resounding Republican primary victory in Alabama a week ago for a sixth term in the Senate.  The committee will question Lisa Fairfax and Hester Peirce for the SEC positions at the hearing as well as Matthew Jeppson to be director of the U.S. Mint. But 13 other nominations remain, including for two Federal Reserve Board governors, the U.S. Treasurys top anti-terrorist finance official and a U.S. Export-Import Bank board member. Without the EXIM board member approved, the trade bank cannot approve large loans or guarantees above $10 million, effectively locking it out of deals for Boeing Co commercial aircraft or major power equipment made by General Electric. Conservatives, including Shelby, had waged a major campaign to close the trade bank last year, idling it for more than five months before Congress voted to renew its charter. He told Reuters in December that the EXIM nomination would be a lower priority for him.   The Fed nominees, former community banker Allan Landon and University of Michigan economist Kathryn Dominguez, would restore the central banks board to its full capacity of seven members.  Many had written off their chances of being confirmed, in part because of the testy relationship between Congress and the Fed, which has opposed Republican bills it says would curb its independence.

Netanyahu's no to Obama no big deal but poorly signaled: White House,"WASHINGTON/TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel would have shown good manners had it informed the United States directly rather than through the news media that it was turning down a proposed summit meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama, the White House said on Tuesday. But spokesman Josh Earnest said there was no offense taken by the decision which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday ascribed to a desire to steer clear of the U.S. presidential election campaign. It was the latest episode in a fraught relationship between the right-wing Israeli leader and the Democratic U.S. president that has yet to recover from deep differences over last years U.S.-led international nuclear deal with Israels foe Iran. In a stark reminder of the paralysis in peace talks which Obama tried to revive earlier in his tenure, an American tourist was stabbed to death on a boardwalk in Tel Aviv in the most serious of several Palestinian attacks on Tuesday. The stabbing occurred about the time U.S. Vice President Joe Biden began a two-day visit to Israel. Biden met former Israeli president Shimon Peres and was due to hold talks on Wednesday with Netanyahu in Jerusalem and with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the occupied West Bank. With a wave of Palestinian street attacks now five months old, U.S. officials did not expect a peace breakthrough during Bidens visit. A 2010 Biden visit was marred by acrimony over a Jewish settlement plan Israel announced during his trip.  The White House said on Monday it had been surprised to learn first from Israeli media that Netanyahu had decided against coming to a conference of the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC in Washington on March 20, and to see a suggestion in some reports that Obamas unavailability had been one of the reasons. It said Netanyahu had been offered a March 18 meeting with Obama, ahead of the presidents landmark visit to Cuba on March 21 and 22. Asked whether the Netanyahu government should have told the Obama administration before the media, Earnest said on Tuesday, I think its just good manners.  Zeev Elkin, an Israeli cabinet minister close to Netanyahu, countered that Israeli ambassador Ron Dermer had given the White House advance warning the trip might not happen. Netanyahus office cited the U.S. election campaign in saying he would not travel to Washington for the AIPAC event, and voiced appreciation for Obamas willingness to host him. In 2012, Netanyahu hosted Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney in Israel in what many Democrats saw as a bid to undermine Obamas attempt to secure a second term. Israel denied meddling. While candidates for the Republican and Democratic presidential nomination have been vying to assert their credentials as friends of Israel, Obama is not up for re-election in November, having served a maximum two terms.  Earnest said Biden was not in Israel to handle talks over a memorandum of understanding about the United States providing military support to Israel. There was a separate channel through which those negotiations were taking place, he said. ",politicsNews,"March 8, 2016 ",1
U.S. Senate banking panel sets hearing for Obama's SEC nominees,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Banking Committee has set a hearing date for President Barack Obamas two nominees to the Securities and Exchange Commission, a move that follows Democrats complaints about a backlog of nominations. The committees hearing for the nominees, Democrat Lisa Fairfax and Republican Hester Peirce, will take place on March 15, more than five months after Obama announced their selection, according to a schedule published on Tuesday.   Senate Banking Committee Democrats, in a letter on Feb. 22, asked the panels chairman, Republican Senator Richard Shelby, to clear the backlog of 16 nominations by Obama to posts related to financial oversight, national security and other areas. If confirmed, Fairfax and Peirce would restore the SECs commission to five members. The agency has been overseen by three commissioners since last year when Republican Daniel Gallagher and Democratic Luis Aguilar stepped down.  The situation has heightened the agencys challenges in recent years of getting a consensus. Only three SEC commissioners remain: Kara Stein is a Democrat; Mike Piwowar, a Republican; and Chair Mary Jo White, an independent. On Feb. 22, White said that she intends to wait until the SEC once again has a full five-member panel before moving forward to appoint a new head of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a body created in the wake of the Enron scandal to police corporate auditors. Another topic that has proven particularly controversial at the SEC are regulatory waivers. Banks and other companies that break criminal laws or face civil fraud charges must apply to the agency for waivers to keep operating normally. Last year, Commissioner Stein began publicly dissenting on waivers, saying the agency was too often rubber-stamping them and creating a policy of too-big-to-bar. Obama tapped Fairfax and Peirce after months of delays and pressure from liberal groups to nominate someone who will be tough on Wall Street. ",politicsNews,"March 8, 2016 ",1
"Obama in 'excellent' health, still using nicotine gum: doctor","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama is in excellent health thanks to daily exercise and a good diet, driving his cholesterol level lower than it was a year and a half ago, his doctor said on Tuesday. Obama, 54, a former smoker, continues to use nicotine gum once in a while and takes medication for occasional acid reflux symptoms, the presidents physician, Ronny Jackson, said in a memo released by the White House. The results from Obamas physical examination last month showed that his total cholesterol level fell to 188 from 213 in May 2014. His weight dropped to 175 pounds (79 kg) from 180 over that period. Obama is 6 feet 1-1/2 inches (1.87 metres) tall. The presidents overall health remains excellent and is improved from his last formal assessment, Jackson wrote. Obamas last assessment was released in June 2014. His adherence to a healthy diet and a consistent exercise program has resulted in an improved lean body mass and lower cholesterol level. All clinical data indicates that the president is currently very healthy and that he will remain so for the duration of his presidency.    Obama leaves office in January 2017.

"After Jindal, Louisiana reels from corporate tax giveaways","(Reuters) - Near the end of his eight years as Louisiana governor, Bobby Jindal, a tax-slashing conservative and presidential hopeful, acknowledged that the states business tax breaks had gone too far. The truth is, we have a system of corporate welfare, Jindal said during an April speech to legislators. The comment resonates now as the state faces its worst budget crisis in three decades - largely because of the soaring cost of subsidies, as well as personal income tax cuts, championed by Jindal. Business tax subsidies peaked in 2012, when the state exempted 88 percent of corporate income taxes, or about $1.8 billion. It has exceeded 80 percent since then, according to the Louisiana Department of Revenue. For a graphic showing how corporate tax exemptions soared as state revenue fell, see tmsnrt.rs/1T7qbm9 Plummeting oil prices dealt the latest blow to state revenues. Deficits are projected at $940 million for the fiscal year ending June 30 and about $2 billion for next year.  Its gotten pretty bad, pretty rapidly, said the state legislatures chief economist, Greg Albrecht, who believes Louisiana is heading into a recession. Jindal has kept a low profile since leaving office in January and could not be reached for comment. In a January speech, he highlighted efforts to cut government and stimulate the economy without raising taxes. You look at the projects  the employers coming in and those who are expanding  weve seen tremendous progress, he said.  In 2008, when Jindal became governor at 36, he was a rising GOP star, often mentioned as a potential presidential candidate. He cultivated that image, staking his political fortunes on a platform of slashing taxes, dismantling big government and attracting business.  The next year, Jindal helped push through legislation to cut personal income taxes and worked to enhance Louisianas already robust corporate tax breaks.  In July of 2009, he signed bills that created or expanded nine tax credits to sectors including film, port cargo and infrastructure. The credits are typically worth 20 to 40 percent of a companys in-state spending, or in some cases spending on payroll or research. In all, annual corporate tax exemptions rose during Jindals term by about $1 billion, to $1.96 billion in 2014, according to state data. His tax-cutting hit a wall in 2013 when he failed to convince a Republican-controlled legislature to abolish personal and business income taxes. He really wanted to go to a national stage, run for president, and say he repealed the personal income tax, said Robert Travis Scott, president of the Public Affairs Research Council, a nonpartisan organization. Many of Jindals political successes had consequences for Louisianas budget. A state-commissioned study found that film tax credits, for example, cost the state an estimated $171 million in 2014.  The state ends up with the short end of the stick, said Loren Scott, author of the study, which also found some economic benefits.  Among the biggest beneficiaries of Louisiana subsidies is the petrochemical industry. One massive project under construction in Southwestern Louisiana - Sempra Energys $6 billion liquefied natural gas processing complex and export terminal - will receive a $2.2 billion property tax break over a decade, records show. The plant will create 130 permanent jobs with average salaries of $80,000, records show. The California-based company also got rebates on some payroll costs and a capital investment tax credit. Louisianas subsidies are getting more scrutiny in the budget crisis. Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards, who took office in January, has proposed cutting incentives but faces resistance from Republican legislators and business groups. The previous administration, Edwards said, blew a hole in our state budget by writing checks for tax credits, rebates, or refunds to corporations with no consideration of whether Louisiana receives a good return on our investment. Jindal advisor Curt Anderson said the subsidies resulted in new jobs and higher wages.  His decision to shrink the government and grow the private sector economy was purposeful.  Business groups continue to support the incentives, saying they are invaluable to the state economy.  In terms of economic development, Jindal was an outstanding governor, said Michael Hecht, president of Greater New Orleans Inc. Corporations are being scapegoated. Falling oil prices and personal income tax cuts also played major roles in the crisis, according to state data. Oil-related revenues are projected to drop by nearly $400 million this fiscal year, the data shows. Personal income tax breaks pushed by Jindal and predecessor, Democrat Kathleen Blanco, reduced revenues by about $800 million annually, said Albrecht, the state economist. Most Louisiana business subsidy programs preceded the Jindal administration, but their use and cost shot up during his tenure, said Jan Moller, director of the nonpartisan Louisiana Budget Project. The governor, he said, directed state economic development officials to aggressively pursue companies and give them as many incentives as possible. As Louisiana faced mounting shortfalls, Jindal sought solutions that didnt involve raising taxes.  Despite the fact that the state was hemorrhaging money, he just wanted to keep his tax virginity for his presidential campaign, said Edward Chervenak, a political science professor at the University of New Orleans, echoing a theme common among Democrats and Republicans alike in the state. Having signed a pledge not to raise taxes, Jindal turned to one-time fixes, such as offering tax amnesty to delinquent taxpayers and raiding state trust funds. That included drawing down $520 million from the Medicaid Trust Fund for the Elderly and $540 million from a reserve fund for state employee healthcare, according to Republican state Treasurer John Kennedy. Jindal failed last year to sell the states tobacco settlement, worth $1.2 billion over time, for an upfront lump sum of $750 million - a move Kennedy compared to a junkie selling his TV or smartphone to buy another fix. Lawmakers now face tough choices. Healthcare and education budgets - particularly colleges - already have been slashed and could see more cuts. And legislators are considering raising sales taxes by up to 2 cents.  State RepresentativeJulie Stokes, a Republican from the New Orleans suburb of Kenner, said her GOP colleagues have been reluctant to raise taxes, and she understands. Look, I dont want to talk about it - Im a conservative Republican from a conservative Republican district, she said. But I just feel like weve got to lose the talking points and have an honest dialogue. ",politicsNews,"March 8, 2016 ",1
Missouri Democrats filibuster proposed gay discrimination amendment,"(Reuters) - Democratic senators in Missouri were in the 20th hour of filibuster on Tuesday, trying to block a Republican-proposed amendment to the state constitution that would prohibit penalties on religious groups that discriminate against same-sex couples.  The Democratic caucus began the filibuster at 4 p.m. on Monday and members said they planned to continue until Wednesday. A filibuster is a prolonged debate - often around the clock - aimed at blocking progress of an initiative. The proposed amendment in Missouri is the latest in a series of measures introduced around the country by conservatives in reaction to last years U.S. Supreme Court legalization of same-sex marriage. The measures seek to protect religious groups and companies from being fined or punished if they decline to provide services such as wedding cakes or flowers to same-sex couples.  The most offensive thing is that it would put discriminatory language into the constitution of the state. But it would also put general revenue of the state at risk, Senate Minority Leader Joe Keaveny, a Democrat, told Reuters. He pointed to a similar Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana that led to groups threatening to cancel conventions in Indianapolis. If the resolution to amend the constitution, SJR 39, passes the Senate, it would go to the states House of Representatives and then to Missouri voters for approval. Republicans dominate both houses of Missouris General Assembly, with 24 of 34 Senate seats and 116 of 163 House seats. Keaveny said Republicans could respond to the filibuster by forcing a vote on the resolution to amend the constitution, but said that would be an unusual step. They could withdraw the resolution, or put it on an informal calendar to debate at a later date. Republican Senator Bob Onder, who sponsored the resolution, said the resolution does not discriminate, but protects vulnerable religious institutions.  We are fighting for fairness and the right for people to freely live out their faith while not infringing on the rights of others, he said.  The language of the proposed amendment says it prohibits the state from imposing a penalty on a religious organization who acts in accordance with a sincere religious belief concerning same sex marriage, which includes the refusal to perform a same sex marriage ceremony or allow a same sex wedding ceremony to be performed on the religious organizations property. Although the amendment does not mention companies, Keaveny said Democrats believe it would allow businesses to claim religious belief as a defense for refusing service to same-sex couples.

Virginia becomes first U.S. state to regulate fantasy sports,"(Reuters) - Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has signed a bill that makes the state the first in the United States to regulate fantasy sports, a multibillion-dollar online business whose legality has been challenged across the country. The measure signed by McAuliffe, a Democrat, mandates that players be 18 or older, offers players limits on how much they can bet, requires annual audits and bars employees from competing in company contests. It takes effect on July 1. This bill, which was passed by super majorities of both chambers, will empower Virginia to regulate this emerging industry and keep consumers safe from abuses, Brian Coy, a McAuliffe spokesman, said in a statement. The governor signed the bill on Monday. The growing fantasy sports industry dominated by DraftKings and FanDuel has drawn increased attention from state regulators over the past year, with the attorneys general of New York, Illinois and Nevada questioning their legality. The games are illegal in several states. The companies charge customers to take part in mostly single-day games in which they draft a roster of players whose performance on the field earns points. In statements on a sports gaming website, spokesmen for  DraftKings and FanDuel welcomed the Virginia measure. Texas reached a deal with FanDuel last week in which the company will halt paid operations in the state on May 2. ",politicsNews,"March 8, 2016 ",1
"Final sentencing reform bill near, says Senate's Grassley","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley said on Tuesday that amendments to a bill to lower sentences for certain non-violent drug offenders are close to being finished.  Grassley said the amendments, which go further to ensure violent offenders are not released, will build more support for the bill among Republican leadership in the Senate, which will decide whether to bring the bill up for a vote.  We are very close to making some changes in this bill so we can get it brought before the United States Senate, Grassley said. Lowering the sentences of drug offenders sentenced under older and more severe laws has been touted as one of the lone areas of bipartisan agreement in a sharply divided U.S. political climate.  Grassley, who once stood in opposition to sentencing reform, introduced a comprehensive criminal justice bill in October that was endorsed by the White House.  In January, a group of Republicans led by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton raised concerns about the bill, citing its potential to qualify thousands of violent criminals for early release.  Criminal justice reform advocates say the legislation would not guarantee the release of violent criminals but simply allow their cases to be reevaluated by a judge.  Grassley called Cottons concerns legitimate and reasonable when speaking at Georgetown University Law School on Tuesday.  Though he did not provide specifics on the amendments, Grassley did say his team of legislators may have to drop parts of the bill that would have allowed offenders caught with firearms in their possession to have their sentences lowered.  We may have to jettison some changes in the firearm offenses and we may be able to do a better job to make sure that no one with a serious history of violence can get any relief under the bill, Grassley said.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not made any guarantee that he will bring the bill to the Senate floor for a vote. But Grassley said the amendments will increase those chances.  Im confident that with the changes that were making in the bill that well get even more support for our bill, Grassley said.  And with more support, Im confident that we will be able to go to the leaders in the Senate and persuade them that this bill is exactly what the American people need to see happen in the United States Senate.

Exclusive: U.S. to announce further easing of Cuba restrictions on March 17 - sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obamas administration will announce further measures to ease travel and trade restrictions on Cuba on March 17, ahead of his historic visit to the Communist-ruled island this month, U.S. congressional sources said on Tuesday. The new rules will mark the latest effort by Obama to use his executive powers to sidestep the U.S. Congress and chip away at the more than half-century-old U.S. economic embargo against Cuba. The anticipated announcement appears timed as a gesture toward Cuba just days before Obama flies to Havana for a March 21-22 visit in another step aimed at ending decades of animosity between the former Cold War foes. It will be the first visit to Cuba by a sitting U.S. president since 1928. The measures are expected to include changes to make it easier for individual Americans to visit Cuba if they qualify under 12 authorized categories of travel such as educational or cultural visits, as well as further loosening of trade and banking rules, said the sources, who were briefed on the matter by administration officials. Though details were still being finalized, the package could also include revised regulations on how the U.S. dollar can be used in trade with Cuba, a person familiar with the discussions said. U.S. regulations restrict or prohibit the Cuban government from using the dollar for international transactions. The White House wants to make a splash on the economic front before Obama gets to Havana, and this is one way to do it, according to the source, who was consulted by Obama aides ahead of the visit. It will come a couple of days before he leaves. Obama plans to hold talks with Cuban President Raul Castro in Havana but also intends to meet dissidents to show that Washington remains committed to promoting human rights on the island, a source of tension with the Cuban government. The White House has invited members of Congress to accompany the president, and congressional aides told Reuters about 20, mostly Obamas fellow Democrats, were expected to go.  Obamas moves to normalize relations with Cuba have encountered stiff resistance from some lawmakers, mostly Republicans but also some Democrats, since the policy shift was first announced on Dec. 17, 2014. They feel the White House is not getting enough back from Castros government in exchange for the eased regulations. The administration believes that moves to loosen the embargo would help meet its goal of benefiting the Cuban people. But even some Democratic aides said they were taken aback by news there would be further moves by the White House without concessions from Havana. Shouldnt we get something from the Cubans in return? one asked. The mainstay of the new regulatory package is expected to be further easing of limits on travel by Americans to Cuba at a time when U.S. airlines are rushing to apply for routes to the island following the recent signing of a bilateral agreement for regular scheduled flights. The rules changes are likely to allow more people to go on self-directed people to people and cultural trips without having to rely on group tours or be sponsored by an organization, two people familiar with the discussions said. But a ban on general tourism to Cuba will remain in force. It is part of the broader U.S. embargo and can only be lifted by Congress. Obama has called for an end to the embargo but Republicans say that will not happen during his presidency, which ends in January 2017. We continue to look at additional regulatory changes that could be made as part of the administrations efforts to further normalize relations with Cuba, an Obama administration official said. But the official declined to provide specifics. ",politicsNews,"March 8, 2016 ",1
"White House seeks new climate measures, trade progress in Trudeau visit","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau are set to discuss new ideas for curbing climate change and expanding trade during an Oval Office meeting this week, White House officials said during a preview on Tuesday. Trudeau, who pledged to repair frayed ties with the United States when he took office in November, will meet with Obama on Thursday ahead of a star-studded state dinner. The White House, which sees a natural partner in Trudeau, hopes the two countries can commit to cut methane emissions from the energy sector by 40 percent to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025, and endorse an initiative to stop routine flaring from oil and gas fields, said Todd Stern, the U.S. climate envoy. The commitment of both leaders to addressing this global challenge is clear and I expect under their leadership North America will make significant progress this year, Stern told reporters. Stern said the two countries also are looking at ways to make carbon emissions from the aviation sector neutral, starting in 2020 through the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization.  The United States also hopes to accelerate the timetable to phase out HFCs, industrial gases that have far more potential to trap the earths heat than carbon dioxide, through an amendment to the Montreal Protocol, Stern said. On trade, a hot-button issue for both Democrats and Republicans in the race to succeed Obama in the Nov. 8 presidential election, the leaders are likely to discuss two longstanding irritants, softwood lumber and meat labeling. A deal governing Canadian softwood lumber exports expired last year, and the two nations are talking about a new arrangement, said Mark Feierstein, the White House National Security Councils senior director for the Western hemisphere. Were open to exploring all options with Canada at this point, Feierstein said, declining to put timelines on when a deal may be reached. The White House also hopes Canada will formally end its World Trade Organization case against a U.S. labeling law that the WTO ruled hurt Canadian beef and pork exports, he said. The United States repealed the law in December. ",politicsNews,"March 8, 2016 ",1
Republican Kasich says does not need delegate lead to win nomination,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ohio Governor John Kasich, who has staked his Republican presidential campaign on the upcoming contests in the Midwest, said on Monday he would not need a lead in the delegate count before his partys convention to win the nomination, according to media reports. In order to be the nominee, you have to have a certain number of votes, Kasich said after a town hall in Monroe, Michigan, which holds its presidential primary on Tuesday. Youve got to win. You dont just say, Well, I have more than anybody else, therefore Im in, Kasich said, according to the Washington Post. Kasich, who is rising in some opinion polls to compete with Ted Cruz for second place in Michigans Republican primary, has embraced the idea of a brokered convention to choose the nominee if no one gets a majority of delegates in the nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election. New York billionaire Donald Trump is at the top of the dwindling Republican pack with the highest delegate count, but victories on Saturday by Cruz, the U.S. senator from Texas, cut into his lead. Kasich trails all his rivals, including U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, in delegates won. Kasichs best showing so far in the presidential nominating contests was second place in New Hampshire. He is hoping for a similar result in Michigan and an outright win in his home state on March 15 to keep his campaign viable. He bristled on Monday when asked about contentions by some Republicans that he is a spoiler in the race to beat Trump, whose rhetoric on immigrants, Muslims and women has raised alarm within the Republican establishment and beyond. Maybe theyre spoiling it for me. Maybe they all ought to get out, Kasich said on Fox News on Monday.   (Reporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Peter Cooney) This article was funded in part by SAP.

Trump already a tainted name in Indonesia after Muslim ban remarks,"BOGOR/JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuters) - Few villagers living near a half-built golf course in Indonesias West Java province know the name Donald Trump, and fewer still are aware that one of his firms will be managing a six-star hotel and luxury resort in their backyard. But in the capital Jakarta, a growing number of Indonesians want the U.S. presidential candidate and his businesses banned from the worlds most populous Muslim-majority nation after Trump pledged to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the United States if elected. The anger simmering across the Pacific is a likely preview of the strained relations a Trump presidency could expect not only in Indonesia, but from the rest of the Muslim world. Indonesia, whose more than 200 million Muslims largely practice a moderate form of Islam, has close relations with the United States. Many Indonesians think highly of President Barack Obama, who spent part of his childhood in Jakarta.   If (Trump) continues his racist position, it will bring danger to American assets, Hasanuddin, a parliamentarian who is also a member of the assemblys commission overseeing foreign policy, told Reuters. Donald Trumps arrogance could be harmful for U.S. citizens around the world. Fadli Zon, the deputy speaker of the house, told Reuters he would seek restrictions on U.S. trade and investment if Trump became president.  The United States is Indonesias second-largest export market, worth about $16 billion last year, and is a popular study destination with children of the elite. An online petition, set up anonymously, is urging Indonesian President Joko Widodo to ban the billionaire and his businesses from the country and has received more than 45,000 signatures.  Donald Trump doesnt want Muslims of the world to enter the United States... so we should do the same to him, signatory Ayu Dyah wrote on the petition website. Condemn, refuse and boycott every Donald Trump business and his affiliations...We should prove that we have power.  Widodo has not responded to the petition. Trumps comments on Muslims have already provoked strong reactions elsewhere, with British politicians in January debating barring the real estate tycoon from entering the country, where he also has business interests. The hostility toward Trump could threaten his companys expansion efforts into Southeast Asias largest economy, Indonesian lawmakers and government officials said. Its just his statement hurts many people in this Muslim-majority country, Edy Putra Irawady, Indonesias deputy chief economic minister, told Reuters. Surely it will be a black shadow for his business. Representatives for Donald Trump did not respond to requests for comment. Trump Hotels Collection last year announced a partnership with Indonesias PT Media Nusanta Citra (MNC) to manage new luxury hotels on Bali and in West Java, the Trump units first foray into Asia. In Bali, one of Asias most popular holiday destinations, Trump Hotels will operate a six-star hotel built atop a cliff overlooking the Indian Ocean and Tanah Lot, a popular sea temple located on a small rock formation. MNC, which will be building both resorts, declined to comment on Trumps politics. Business is business. The implication for wider Indonesia, we have to see later, said Syafriel Nasution, corporate secretary of MNC Group, adding that he had not seen any damage to the companys brand due to its relationship with Trump. MNC Group is controlled by billionaire Hary Tanoesoedibjo, Indonesias 28th richest person, who also owns four national television stations and last year launched a new political party. A senior member of Muhammadiyah, Indonesias second-largest Muslim organization, said protests were possible if Trump becomes president, though none were yet planned.  Indonesian Muslims are very strongly united, said Abdul Muthi, the groups secretary general. If he is elected, there will be a strong reaction from Indonesian communities to any business that is run by Donald Trump.  In West Java, near where Trumps golf resort will be built, one villager said he had never heard of Trump and wouldnt be protesting against him. If we protest, he will likely close his business, said Agus, who owns a small mobile phone shop. And for the time being, earning money is hard.

U.S. rebuffs Koch-controlled coal company's bid for royalties,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration has rejected a plea by billionaire investor William Koch to refund as much as $14 million in royalties on a now-shut Colorado mine, according to a letter explaining the decision. The Interior Department last week ruled that Oxbow Mining, a subsidiary of Koch-controlled Oxbow Carbon LLC, is not entitled to a royalty rate reduction since the move would do nothing to return the mine to life. Reducing royalty rates has been a tool used by the federal government for decades when maximizing coal production was part of a national energy policy. Oxbow closed its Elk Creek site in western Colorado two years ago after setbacks such as a fire and partial collapse made working the underground mine too costly, according to the company and regulatory paperwork. Oxbow has said it has no plans to reopen the facility, which once employed more than 200 people. Machinery is being sold for scrap and the mine is ready to be sealed, according to regulatory paperwork. These circumstances indicate that a royalty rate reduction will not expand recovery or promote further development of the leases, the Interior Departments Bureau of Land Management wrote last week in a letter made public on Monday. Royalty rate reduction and other such programs meant to promote coal production on public lands are now under scrutiny since President Barack Obama has vowed to curb the nations reliance on fossil fuels, which contribute to global warming. William Koch was an heir to the Fred C. Koch family fortune, and two of his brothers, Charles and David, are leading figures in conservative politics. While William Koch is not as politically prominent as his brothers, he has been a significant political donor to conservative causes in the past. A spokesman for Koch and Oxbow did not immediately respond to a call for comment. Rocky Mountain coal has been valued at $35 a ton or more in the last several years, according to a Reuters review of Energy Information Administration data. Because the BLM recommends a royalty rate reduction on 13.1 million tons of coal, the decision positions Oxbow to receive at least a $14 million refund on fuel mined since 2012, according to a Reuters calculation.",politicsNews,"March 8, 2016 ",1
"Bloomberg opts out of U.S. presidential bid, calls for centrism","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said on Monday he would not mount an independent bid for the U.S. presidency because he feared it would increase the chances that Republicans Donald Trump or Ted Cruz could end up in the White House. A billionaire media mogul who combined business-friendly fiscal policies with liberal views on gun control and other social issues, Bloomberg could have potentially appealed to centrist voters in a year when candidates from the far left and right of the political spectrum have gained traction. But Bloomberg, 74, said he had concluded that any candidate would be unlikely to win a clear majority in a three-person race. That would throw the election into the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, which would be able to hand the White House to Trump, a real-estate billionaire, or Cruz, a conservative U.S. senator from Texas.   That is not a risk I can take in good conscience, he wrote on Bloomberg View, an opinion website that is part of his media empire. Bloomberg never received much interest from American voters.     About 12 percent of likely voters said they would support him in a three-way race for president with Democrat Hillary Clinton and Trump, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national poll conducted from Wednesday to Monday.   Among respondents, 41 percent said they would support Clinton and 31 percent would support Trump. The poll of 1,695 likely voters had a credibility interval of 3 percentage points. Bloomberg said Trump, who is leading the battle to win the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election, had backed policies that would undermine religious tolerance and threaten national security. Trump has called for building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, deporting the countrys illegal immigrants and temporarily barring Muslims from entering the country.  He has run the most divisive and demagogic presidential campaign I can remember, preying on peoples prejudices and fears, Bloomberg wrote of Trump. He said Cruz, a favorite of evangelicals and the conservative Tea Party movement, was divisive as well. Bloomberg also hit out at Clinton and her rival for the Democratic nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont, for criticizing free trade and the financial industry. Extremism is on the march, and unless we stop it, our problems at home and abroad will grow worse, he wrote. Spokespeople for Trump and Cruz did not immediately respond to requests for comment about Bloombergs criticism.  Bloomberg founded and is majority owner of Bloomberg L.P., a news and financial information provider that competes with Thomson Reuters Corp TRI.TO. The fear of a general election contest between Trump and Sanders, a democratic socialist, had driven Bloomberg to begin seriously exploring an independent run, a senior adviser said on condition of anonymity.  But with Clinton pulling away from Sanders in the Democratic race, Bloomberg concluded the path to victory and the rationale for running were gone, the aide said. Clinton reacted to the news with polite praise, saying she had the greatest respect for Bloomberg. He has to make his own decisions, but I look forward to continuing to work with him, she said on Fox News. Sanders, when asked about Bloombergs decision not to run, said election laws should be changed to make it easier for people who are not rich, or not friendly with rich people, to run for office.  I think its a bad idea for American democracy that the only people who feel in many ways they can run for president are people who have so much money, he said on Fox News.

Clinton's pledge to curtail fracking falls on unconvinced ears,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clintons vow to regulate oil and gas fracking almost out of existence was met with skepticism Monday, failing to convince either industry or environment groups that she would - or could - end the controversial drilling practice if she becomes president. The front-runner for the Democratic party nomination used a debate in Flint, Michigan on Sunday night to oppose fracking anywhere local communities were against it, wherever it polluted air or water, and whenever companies refused to disclose what chemicals they use in the process.   By the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place, she said. But supporters and opponents of fracking dismissed her position as campaign rhetoric that would collide with the limited powers of a president to control an activity largely regulated at the state level. Defenders of fracking said no president would try to put the brakes on a drilling technique that has flooded the U.S. with cheap oil and gas. Secretary Clintons answer is essentially campaign hyperbole, and meant to appease her environmental constituency, said Bruce Bullock, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Texas Southern Methodist University, in a blog post in the Dallas Morning News. In reality, it has little substance to it. Green groups welcomed Clintons shift from her past support for fracking. But they also urged her to stop laying down conditions and caveats. Clinton will continue to struggle to convince climate advocates that she is serious about addressing the crisis until she comes out for a full ban on fracking, said Yong Jung Cho, campaign coordinator of grassroots groups 350 Action. As secretary of state, Clinton supported fracking as a way to reduce U.S. dependence on imported energy, and even led a push to spread shale extraction to allies in Europe to wean them off Russian gas.[L1N0VX2JT] Her pledge in Flint to curtail the practice followed the blunt declaration against fracking by Senator Bernard Sanders, her sole rival for the nomination. Sanders challenge has shifted some of Clintons positions in the campaign, and her statement on fracking now comes closer to wider Democratic party sentiment. Secretary Clinton has been pushed to the left by Senator Sanders, said Kathleen Sgamma, vice president of government affairs at the Western Energy Alliance. Sgamma said Democrats from President Barack Obama to Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper support fracking and the economic benefits its brings to many states.  Sometimes things said in the heat of a debate are later wisely set aside when faced with the economic and national security consequences of shutting down the technique that unlocks huge domestic sources of energy that would otherwise have to come from Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran, she said. The Clinton campaign said the candidate has previously criticized fracking when it clashed with local opposition. If a local government says no (to fracking), not here, they should be able to do that, Clinton said during a campaign stop in Keene, New Hampshire last October. But fracking for natural gas has also drastically reduced the amount of coal being burned to produce electricity, and has been mostly supported by the Obama administration.  David Koranyi, director of the Eurasian Energy Future Initiative at the Atlantic Council said Clintons very circumspect answer to the question in Flint actually reflected the Obama administrations current approach to fracking, which  seeks to continue expanding shale production with more environmental oversight. I believe wrapped in her strong statement is a pragmatic approach that recognizes the merits of natural gas as a bridge fuel in the process of decarbonization, he said.  Clintons harder line did, however, delineate the clear differences between Democrats and Republicans on the issue. All Republican contenders have strongly defended fracking, leading Louis Finkel of the American Petroleum Institute to attack Clintons position as a political stunt by those who are spouting populist rhetoric for political points. The importance of fracking to the American economy, he said, means the Democrats are not being honest with American voters.

Israel's Netanyahu declines offer to meet with Obama: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declined an offer to meet U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House later this month and canceled his trip to Washington, the White House said on Monday. Netanyahus decision to nix his U.S. visit marked the latest episode in a fraught relationship with Obama that has yet to recover from their deep differences over last years U.S.-led international nuclear deal with Iran, Israels arch foe. The White House said the Israeli government had requested a Netanyahu meeting with Obama on either March 18 or 19 and that two weeks ago he was offered a March 18 encounter. We were looking forward to hosting the bilateral meeting, and we were surprised to first learn via media reports that the prime minister, rather than accept our invitation, opted to cancel his visit, White House spokesman Ned Price said in an emailed statement. Reports that we were not able to accommodate the prime ministers schedule are false, he said. The White House has announced Obamas plans to be in Havana on March 21 and 22 for a historic visit aimed at moving closer toward normalized relations with Washingtons former Cold War adversary. There was no immediate word from Netanyahus office about the cancellation, which also comes as the two close allies are struggling to negotiate a new 10-year, multibillion-dollar defense aid agreement for Israel. Israels Channel 10 TV, citing unnamed Israeli sources, said Netanyahus decision to scrap the trip appeared to be motivated by reluctance to be perceived as interfering in the U.S. presidential election campaign, should any candidates seek to meet him in Washington.  Netanyahu also saw little to show for such a trip, given that the new defense Memorandum of Understanding is far from being agreed yet, Channel 10 said. Several Israeli media quoted Israeli officials as saying that no appropriate time could be found for the meeting before Obamas departure for Cuba. Netanyahu had been expected to visit Washington this month not only to see Obama but to address the annual conference of the leading U.S. pro-Israel lobby, AIPAC. In the past he has sometimes spoken to the group via satellite. The prime minister made a speech to the U.S. Congress last March criticizing the then-emerging Iran nuclear deal and was denied a meeting with Obama during that visit in what was widely regarded as a diplomatic snub. But the two leaders met at the White House in November and sought to mend ties. In recent months, differences over defense aid have underscored continuing tensions over the Iran deal. Netanyahu and his aides suggested in February if Israel were unable to reach an accord with Obama, it could wait for the next  president to secure better terms. Current U.S. defense aid to Israel, worth about $3 billion annually, expires in 2018. The two sides are seeking an extension before Obama leaves office in January 2017. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, on a five-day trip to the Middle East, is due to visit Israel later this week and hold talks with Netanyahu. ",politicsNews,"March 7, 2016 ",1
"Oklahoma governor wants to use reserve fund to shore up schools, prisons","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin on Monday proposed drawing $72 million from the states Rainy Day Fund to spare public schools and prisons from severe cutbacks as the oil-rich state grapples with deepening budget cuts linked to the collapse of energy prices. Fallin, a Republican, suggested using $51 million for public schools to prevent a four-day school week and $21 million for the Department of Corrections to head off draconian cuts to prisons.  The Rainy Day Fund contains $385 million, of which $144.4 million is available to address the 2016 fiscal year revenue failure, according to Fallins office.   The deepened revenue failure cuts have changed the budget situation in a way that requires immediate action, so I support accessing the Rainy Day Fund for common education and prisons, Fallin said.  She said withdrawing from the fund was the most responsible option available to keep vital services at acceptable levels until an agreement on recurring revenues can be reached between the governor and the legislature.   The Rainy Day Fund option is a one-time fix, but we need to do the tough work to establish a permanent fix in the budget we pass this session, she said.  Oil-related tax revenue accounted for 10 percent of Oklahomas budget at the peak of the shale oil boom in 2014.  The state has already cut spending on education, which accounts for a third of its $7 billion budget, by $25 million in the 2015-2016 fiscal year, and another $20 million cut looms.  On Monday global oil prices jumped more than 5 percent to $40 a barrel, the highest price so far this year.  ",politicsNews,"March 8, 2016 ",1
Apple case exposes ongoing government rift over encryption policy,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Even as the Department of Justice battles Apple in court over access to encrypted data, the Obama administration remains split over backing requirements that tech manufacturers provide law enforcement with a back door into their products, according to a dozen people familiar with the internal debate. FBI Director James Comey and the DOJ - who are fighting to access an iPhone tied to the San Bernardino attacks  have long tried and failed to convince other departments to join the broader battle against unbreakable encryption, the current and former government officials said. Federal justice officials argue that strong encryption makes it harder to track criminals, a central contention in the iPhone case. But officials in other departments - including Commerce, State and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy - counter that encryption is integral to protecting U.S. secrets and the technology industry. The issue has been discussed in meetings of the interagency National Security Council and elsewhere. Some government officials also worry that confronting the tech sector on the issue could heighten distrust of American products overseas and drive terrorists and top criminals to seek foreign-made encryption.  Several key officials in the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security opposed the fight with Apple based on those concerns, the sources said. Luke Dembosky - until recently the deputy assistant attorney general for national security and the senior cybersecurity prosecutor on some of the biggest hacking cases in recent years - cast the broader disagreements over encryption as very healthy.  Its a very big government, and everyone is trying to do the right thing, said Dembosky, who last week joined the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton LLP. There are countries where they dont have these debates.  NSA Director Michael Rogers has taken a middle ground, saying that strong encryption is important but compromise is desirable.  Years of interagency debates over encryption have left the Obama administration lacking a cohesive policy stance on the issue, many tech industry leaders have said.  The Justice Department last month persuaded a federal judge to order Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to write software to help unlock an iPhone used by shooter Rizwan Farook in the December attack in San Bernardino. Apple is fighting the order, calling the case an overreach by prosecutors that threatens the security of all iPhones. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for later this month. As is customary in such cases, the decision to take action against Apple was made without consulting the White House, said two sources familiar with the matter. The DOJ and FBI pursue all such matters independent of the White House, a senior administration official said.  The official added that the White House does not intend to seek legislation mandating back doors. In an interview, John Carlin, assistant attorney general for national security, dismissed suggestions that some administration officials did not support the Justice Departments action in the Apple case. The effort was never intended to settle the encryption debate, he said, but rather to assist San Bernardino County, which asked for help in unlocking Farooks county-owned iPhone 5c.  The tech industry has united behind Apple, with more than 40 companies this week submitting legal briefs arguing that compliance with the judges order would undermine encryption and public trust in Internet security.  By contrast, the division among government agencies has left some administration officials in an awkward position of publicly supporting the Justice Departments case against Apple while also acknowledging the need for strong encryption. They have been more vocal about their concerns behind closed doors, according to four people who have spoken with them or their subordinates.  Just to cut to the chase, Im not a believer in back doors or a single technical approach, Defense Secretary Ash Carter told a largely pro-Apple crowd at the RSA security conference onWednesday. I dont think we ought to let one case drive a single solution.  Congress is also divided on the issue, with liberal Democrats joining libertarian Republicans in opposing government back doors. The lack of consensus prompted the White House last year to abandon a push for legislation that would require U.S. technology firms to provide law enforcement a way around encryption.  Privately, however, President Obama sought a compromise, asking large telecommunications and technology firms, including Apple and Microsoft, to work toward an exceptional access agreement that would provide investigators access to content that is typically encrypted, said two sources with knowledge of the discussion.  An Apple spokesman said that the company never seriously considered installing a back door and tried to shift the discussion to a broader conversation about law enforcement cooperation.  Either way, Apple CEO Tim Cook lambasted the White House for not publicly affirming support for strong encryption at a January summit in San Jose, Calif. between technology executives and senior national security officials convened largely to discuss online extremism, sources familiar with the meeting said.  Cooks comments aggravated White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, who thought the iPhone maker was backtracking on its earlier commitment to work collaboratively on resolving law enforcements encryption concerns, according to one person with knowledge of the situation.  That confrontation helps explain why, after months of apparent respectful disagreement in public and private pursuit of compromise, both sides suddenly came to battle heavily armed.  Amid the hostilities between Apple and the FBI, some have called for President Obama to weigh in to help resolve the standoff. Im waiting to hear what the president has to say about it, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, who supports Apple, said in an interview. I know [White House Press Secretary] Josh Earnest has said he is for the Justice Department, [but] I want to hear from the president. ",politicsNews,"March 5, 2016 ",1
"Lawmakers to go to Cuba with Obama, who mulls more trade moves","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will be accompanied on his historic visit to Cuba this month by up to 20 members of Congress, and is also considering further measures to ease travel and trade restrictions around the time of the visit, U.S. sources said on Monday. Details were being worked out, but congressional sources told Reuters the White House hoped the delegation would include Republicans as well as Obamas fellow Democrats, to underscore bipartisan support for his moves toward normal relations with the Communist-ruled country. Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who has been one of his partys leading proponents of easing the embargo restrictions, said there was a good chance he would join the trip. A spokesman for Flake later confirmed he would be going. Congressional aides and sources outside the government who were consulted on the matter said timing was still uncertain, but the administration could roll out more changes to travel, trade and banking rules before or during the March 21-22 visit. They will unveil a regulations package as it gets closer to the trip, further easing of travel, and further commerce and trade (changes), said one person familiar with the discussions. Obamas aides are considering regulatory changes to make it easier for individual Americans to visit Cuba as long as they qualify for 12 authorized people-to-people categories of travel, the sources said. Until now, most have been allowed to visit Cuba only on group tours or to see family on the island. The White House is also weighing possible revisions and clarifications of how the dollar can be used in trade with Cuba, a person familiar with the discussions said. The White House said on Feb. 18 that Obama would visit Havana on March 21 and 22 in another step toward ending decades of animosity between the former Cold War foes. It will be the first visit to Cuba by a sitting U.S. president since 1928. News of Obamas trip prompted sharp criticism from some members of the Republican-controlled Congress, where there is strong opposition to normalizing relations with Havana, mostly from Republican lawmakers. Some Republicans want more normal relations with Cuba, as do most Democrats. But the issue is complicated on Capitol Hill because two senators vying for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, both Cuban-Americans, strongly oppose Obamas policy shift.  Obama said the trip would help accelerate changes in Cuba since he and President Raul Castro announced moves to restore ties in late 2014. Administration officials hope it will give Washington more leverage to make progress on opening business opportunities for U.S. companies. Opponents say Obama has demanded too little from Havana, particularly in the area of human rights, to end the embargo imposed in 1960. The administration believes that moves to loosen the embargo would help meet its goal of benefiting the Cuban people. Obama has used his executive powers to ease some trade and travel restrictions since announcing his new Cuba policy 15 months ago. Some major U.S. airlines have begun asking regulators to approve routes to Cuba. So many lawmakers are expected to make the trip that the White House is arranging a separate aircraft to transport them, congressional aides said. As the president has done on past trips, he has invited a group of senators and House members to join him on his upcoming trip to Cuba. Further details on the members travel will be available closer to the departure date, a White House official said on condition of anonymity. Analysts said establishing U.S.-Cuban business relationships would make it difficult for the next U.S. president to roll back Obamas policy changes after he leaves office next January, if a Republican opponent of the policy wins the election. Businessman Donald Trump, the leading Republican candidate, told the Daily Caller in an interview published in September that he supported the Obama administrations opening with Cuba. But the embargo cannot be lifted without Congress approval and Republicans say that will not happen while Obama is president. ",politicsNews,"March 7, 2016 ",1
"Pennsylvania governor raises minimum wage for state workers, contractors","HARRISBURG, Pa. (Reuters) - Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf raised the minimum wage for state workers and employees of some contractors by 40 percent to $10.15 an hour on Monday, a gesture aimed in part at putting pressure on Republican lawmakers. Wolf, a Democrat, who signed an executive order to make the change, acknowledged that only 450 of the states 79,000 employees, mainly temporary workers hired during tax season, are currently paid less than $10.15 an hour. He said he hoped to send a message to the Republican-dominated Legislature to enact a similar increase for all Pennsylvania residents. An increase in the minimum wage will lead to increases in employee morale, productivity, and quality of work and decreases in turnover and the cost of training and supervision, said Wolf, who lacks the power to order the statewide increase.  At a press conference, Wolf said a statewide increase would benefit business in the long run. Fourteen states have a minimum wage of at least $10. The governor said inflation had pushed the value of the states current $7.25 minimum wage below the poverty line. Going forward, the state would adjust the minimum wage for government workers to keep up with inflation, he said. Wolf did not specify where the money would come from when questioned during the news conference.  Pennsylvania has been without a state budget since July 1 because of Republican resistance to raising taxes and Wolfs refusal to sign a budget that he said would lead to a gaping structural deficit. The wage increase announced for state employees would cost the state $1.5 million and will take effect immediately. It would apply to many but not all contractors doing business with the state, costing the state an extra $2.6 million.  About 60 percent of that will go to contract employees at the states photo license bureaus, but only when those contracts are renewed.  The minimum wage increase will not apply for now to human service agencies funded by the state, Wolf said, because they are already stressed by delayed funding caused by the budget stand-off. Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman accused Wolf of acting like President Barack Obama by seeking to implement policy changes through executive orders. Choosing to take symbolic executive action on this issue instead of working with the legislature underscores his failures to collaborate,Corman said in a statement. ",politicsNews,"March 7, 2016 ",1
U.S. 'disappointed' by India's visa refusal for religious rights panel,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department was disappointed India had refused visas to members of a U.S. commission that examines violations of religious freedom around the world, a spokesman said on Monday. The commission, made up mainly of professors and leaders of non-profit groups appointed by the president and members of Congress, had planned to travel to India last week but New Delhi failed to issue them visas. The Indian Embassy said in a statement on its web site that a foreign entity like the U.S. commission had no standing to pass judgment on the state of Indias constitutionally protected rights. Robert George, a professor of jurisprudence at Princeton who chairs the commission, said last week it was unfortunate that a secular democracy like India had refused a visit from the panel, which has been permitted in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and China, which restrict religious freedoms. State Department spokesman John Kirby said the United States was disappointed by this news. Were supportive of the commission and the important role they play in reviewing facts and circumstances of violations of religious freedom around the world, Kirby said. He declined to say whether the State Department had discussed the issue with counterparts in New Delhi. But he did say the United States remained engaged in a number of discussions with the government on the issue. The commission said in its 2015 report on religious freedom that incidents of religiously motivated and communal violence had reportedly increased for three consecutive years. It said that despite Indias status as a pluralistic, secular democracy, New Delhi had long struggled to protect minority religious communities or provide justice when crimes occurred, creating a climate of impunity. Non-governmental organizations and religious leaders, including from the Muslim, Christian, and Sikh communities, attributed the initial increase in violence to religiously divisive campaigning in the 2014 general election by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, which won the vote. Since the election, religious minorities have been subject to derogatory comments by politicians linked the BJP and numerous violent attacks and forced conversions by Hindu nationalist groups. Despite a much-heralded fresh start in U.S.-India relations under Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the BJP, the United States has run into problems arranging visits by other American officials, including the head of its office to combat human trafficking and its special envoy for gay rights.

Virginia Senate approves electric chair amid drug shortage,"RICHMOND, Va. (Reuters) - The Virginia state Senate on Monday approved a bill making the  electric chair the default method of execution if lethal injection drugs are unavailable. The bill passed the Republican-controlled Senate by a 22-17 vote. The Republican-dominated House has already approved the measure. After a lower chamber vote on a minor amendment, the measure will go to Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe for approval. A spokesman for the governor said the measure would be reviewed when it arrived. Virginia is one of eight states that allows electrocution as a method of execution, letting condemned inmates choose between it and lethal injection. If they do not choose, lethal injection is used. Virginia, along with other states, has struggled to get lethal injection drugs because pharmaceutical companies have protested their use in executions. The last death row inmate in Virginia to choose the electric chair for execution was in 2013. Inmate Ricky Gray, who killed six people in Richmond in 2006, had been scheduled for execution on March 16, adding urgency to the legislative debate. Grays execution has been postponed by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, pending a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court about whether to hear the case. Gray has not indicated which method of execution he preferred. The legislation has fueled debate in Virginia over whether capital punishment, especially the electric chair, constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The electric chair is outdated and barbaric, Senator Scott Surovell, a Democrat from northern Virginia, said during a floor debate. He lost an effort to amend the bill by requiring the Virginia Department of Corrections to explain in detail why it was not able to obtain lethal drugs before opting for electrocution. State Senator Mark Obenshain, a Republican from the Shenandoah Valley, argued that if the amendment passed it would have further delayed execution of death row inmates. Some (people) just have black hearts. Theyre beyond redemption, said Obenshain, an unsuccessful Republican  candidate for state attorney general in 2013. ",politicsNews,"March 7, 2016 ",1
Obama says both left and right are wrong on Wall Street rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday defended his efforts to rein in Wall Street, telling Americans that his administration cracked down effectively on banks and trading firms after the financial crisis of 2007-2009. Obama, now in the last 10 months of his presidency, met at the White House with Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and other top regulators to talk about their progress implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act he signed into law in 2010.  He railed against rhetoric in the Nov. 8 presidential election campaign suggesting that Dodd-Frank failed to work. I want to emphasize this because it is popular in the media and the political discourse, both on the left and the right, to suggest that the crisis happened and nothing changed. That is not true, Obama told reporters after the meeting. On the left, Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders has said Wall Street regulations have not gone far enough. He wants to break up big banks and has criticized his rival Hillary Clinton for being too close to Wall Street. On the right, Republicans have complained that Dodd-Frank favored big banks and hurt the ability of small banks to make loans. Obama said regulators appear set by the end of the year to have achieved most of the goals he set out for the financial system in 2008, when he first took office, although he noted there was still work to do on rules for hedge funds and asset managers in what he called the shadow banking system. One of our projects is to make sure that we are covering some of those potential gaps, he said. We may need at some point help from Congress to do that. Regulators also need to complete rules on executive compensation to make sure Wall Street is less incentivized to take big reckless risks that could end up harming our financial sector, he said. Obama told reporters the Republican-controlled Congress has tried to weaken regulations established after the financial crisis and starve regulators with budget cuts. Whether you are a Democrat or a Republican or a Tea Party member or a socialist, if you are concerned about making sure that Wall Street is doing the right thing, check to make sure that your member of Congress is not trying to cut the budgets of these various agencies, Obama said.

"Canada's Trudeau: won't support Trump, but understands his appeal","OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday said he would neither fight Donald Trump, nor support him, but understood the Republicans appeal for people fed up with politics, who he said had also voted for controversial Toronto mayor Rob Ford. Trudeau - who will visit Washington this week for talks with President Barack Obama - took office last November and will be in power when the next occupant of the White House takes over in January 2017. Trudeau also suggested Trump might not be serious about policy platforms such as tearing up the North American Free Trade Agreement, which could badly damage Canadas economy. Im not going to pick a fight with Donald Trump right now. Im not going to support him either, obviously, Trudeau told a live forum hosted by the Huffington Post when pressed to condemn the Republican. Trudeau said he was watching the United States closely to see how it deals with what is obviously a very real set of issues around frustration toward the body politic which had been seen around the world. He cited the case of Ford, the former populist mayor of Toronto who gained global notoriety for admitting to smoking crack while in office. We had a mayor called Rob Ford here for a while and theres a lot of people who didnt get it. But he tapped into a very real and legitimate sense that people had around who politicians were, said Trudeau. The prime minister seemed less concerned when asked about Trumps proposals to temporarily bar Muslims from the United States and deport millions of illegal immigrants. Lets see if the things that he needed to say in order to secure the Republican nomination are the same things he chooses to say in order to win the Presidency, if thats what happens, he said.

U.S. takes North Korea nuclear threats seriously: State Department,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Monday the United States took North Korean threats to use nuclear weapons seriously and urged Pyongyang to halt its provocations, including testing nuclear devices and long-range rockets. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered his country last week to be prepared to use nuclear weapons at any time and to be ready to carry out a pre-emptive attack, state media reported. His comments came as U.S. and South Korean forces conducted annual military exercises amid heightened tensions on the peninsula following the Norths recent nuclear and missile tests, which prompted the United Nations to impose new sanctions on Pyongyang. We certainly do take those kinds of threats seriously ... and again call on Pyongyang to cease with the provocative rhetoric, cease with the threats and quite frankly, more critically, cease with the provocative behavior, the actual conduct, that has led to yet another round of international sanctions, State Department spokesman John Kirby said.

NY judge dismisses attempt to block Canada-born Cruz from state's ballot ,"ALBANY, New York (Reuters) - A New York judge on Monday dismissed a challenge to Canadian-born Ted Cruzs eligibility to run in the states Republican presidential primary election next month, saying the challengers had missed a key deadline for filing. Two New York residents, Barry Korman, 81, of Manhattan and William Gallo, 85, of Manhasset, Long Island, on Feb. 19 filed the petition to block Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, from getting onto the April 19 ballot, saying his birth in the Canadian province of Alberta makes him ineligible to be president.  State law requires that a petition challenging eligibility be filed within three days of when a candidate files to be placed on the ballot. Korman and Gallo filed their petition more than two weeks after Cruz filed his paperwork to get on the ballot, the judge said. Weinstein said at an earlier hearing that the case could cause chaos if it went ahead.  The case was one of several similar challenges to Cruzs eligibility to run for the White House - including suits in Alabama, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Texas. The Illinois suit was dismissed last week on a technicality. Republican front-runner Donald Trump has repeatedly brought up questions about whether Cruz meets the constitutional requirement to be president.  The Constitution says that to be president, a person must be a natural-born citizen of the United States. Cruz has argued that he is eligible to run because of his mothers U.S. citizenship, and many legal experts say it is unlikely any judge in the United States would block his presidential bid. Cruzs father is a Cuban immigrant. A lawyer for the objectors, Roger Bernstein, said an appeal is likely.  (Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Leslie Adler) This article was funded in part by SAP.

"Bloomberg opts out of U.S. presidential bid, calls for centrism","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said on Monday he would not mount an independent bid for the U.S. presidency because he feared it would increase the chances that Republicans Donald Trump or Ted Cruz could end up in the White House. A billionaire media mogul who combined business-friendly fiscal policies with liberal views on gun control and other social issues, Bloomberg could have potentially appealed to centrist voters in a year when candidates from the far left and right of the political spectrum have gained traction. But Bloomberg, 74, said he had concluded that any candidate would be unlikely to win a clear majority in a three-person race. That would throw the election into the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, which would be able to hand the White House to Trump, a real-estate billionaire, or Cruz, a conservative U.S. senator from Texas.   That is not a risk I can take in good conscience, he wrote on Bloomberg View, an opinion website that is part of his media empire. Bloomberg never received much interest from American voters.     About 12 percent of likely voters said they would support him in a three-way race for president with Democrat Hillary Clinton and Trump, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national poll conducted from Wednesday to Monday.   Among respondents, 41 percent said they would support Clinton and 31 percent would support Trump. The poll of 1,695 likely voters had a credibility interval of 3 percentage points. Bloomberg said Trump, who is leading the battle to win the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election, had backed policies that would undermine religious tolerance and threaten national security. Trump has called for building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, deporting the countrys illegal immigrants and temporarily barring Muslims from entering the country.  He has run the most divisive and demagogic presidential campaign I can remember, preying on peoples prejudices and fears, Bloomberg wrote of Trump. He said Cruz, a favorite of evangelicals and the conservative Tea Party movement, was divisive as well. Bloomberg also hit out at Clinton and her rival for the Democratic nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont, for criticizing free trade and the financial industry. Extremism is on the march, and unless we stop it, our problems at home and abroad will grow worse, he wrote. Spokespeople for Trump and Cruz did not immediately respond to requests for comment about Bloombergs criticism.  Bloomberg founded and is majority owner of Bloomberg L.P., a news and financial information provider that competes with Thomson Reuters Corp TRI.TO. The fear of a general election contest between Trump and Sanders, a democratic socialist, had driven Bloomberg to begin seriously exploring an independent run, a senior adviser said on condition of anonymity.  But with Clinton pulling away from Sanders in the Democratic race, Bloomberg concluded the path to victory and the rationale for running were gone, the aide said. Clinton reacted to the news with polite praise, saying she had the greatest respect for Bloomberg. He has to make his own decisions, but I look forward to continuing to work with him, she said on Fox News. Sanders, when asked about Bloombergs decision not to run, said election laws should be changed to make it easier for people who are not rich, or not friendly with rich people, to run for office.  I think its a bad idea for American democracy that the only people who feel in many ways they can run for president are people who have so much money, he said on Fox News.

Foreign diplomats voicing alarm to U.S. officials about Trump," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Foreign diplomats are expressing alarm to U.S. government officials about what they say are inflammatory and insulting public statements by Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, according to senior U.S. officials.  Officials from Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia have complained in recent private conversations, mostly about the xenophobic nature of Trumps statements, said three U.S. officials, who all declined to be identified.  READ MORE: Trump's foreign policy team is still TBD As the (Trump) rhetoric has continued, and in some cases amped up, so, too, have concerns by certain leaders around the world, said one of the officials.  The three officialsdeclined to disclose a full list of countries whose diplomats have complained, but two said they included at least India, South Korea, Japan and Mexico.  U.S. officials said it was highly unusual for foreign diplomats to express concern, even privately, about candidates in the midst of a presidential campaign. U.S. allies in particular usually dont want to be seen as meddling in domestic politics, mindful that they will have to work with whoever wins.  Senior leaders in several countries  including Britain, Mexico, France, and Canada  have already made public comments criticizing Trumps positions. German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel branded him a threat to peace and prosperity in an interview published on Sunday.  Trump's campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the private diplomatic complaints.READ MORE: Nike suspends ties with Sharapova after failed drug test RECOMMENDED: Gun silencers, not just for hitmen Japans embassy declined to comment. The Indian and South Korean embassies did not respond to requests for comment.  A spokesperson for the Mexican government would not confirm any private complaints but noted that its top diplomat, Claudia Ruiz Massieu, said last week that Trumps policies and comments were ignorant and racist and that his plan to build a border wall to stop illegal immigration was absurd.  The foreign officials have been particularly disturbed by the anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim themes that the billionaire real estate mogul has pushed, according to the U.S. officials.  European and Middle Eastern government representatives have expressed dismay to U.S. officials about anti-Muslim declarations by Trump that they say are being used in recruiting pitches by the Islamic State and other violent jihadist groups.  On Dec. 7, Trumps campaign issued a written statement saying that he was calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our countrys representatives can figure out what is going on.  Trump subsequently said in television interviews that American Muslims traveling abroad would be allowed to return to the country, as would Muslim members of the U.S. military or Muslim athletes coming to compete in the United States.  There are also concerns abroad that the United States would become more insular under Trump, who has pledged to tear up international trade agreements and push allies to take a bigger role in tackling Middle East conflicts.  European diplomats are constantly asking about Trumps rise with disbelief and, now, growing panic, said a senior NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity.  With the EU facing an existential crisis, theres more than the usual anxiety about the U.S. turning inward when Europe needs U.S. support more than ever.  Another of the senior U.S. officials said the complaints are coming mostly from mid-to-low ranking diplomats  described as working level - rather than from the most senior officials.  The responses have ranged from amusement to befuddlement to curiosity, the official said. In some cases, weve heard expressions of alarm, but those have been more in response to the anti-immigrant and anti-refugee sentiment as well as the general sense of xenophobia.  More than a hundred Republican foreign policy veterans pledged this week to oppose Trump, saying in an open letter that his proposals would undermine U.S. security.  On Tuesday, General Philip Breedlove, the United States top military commander in Europe, said that the U.S. elections were stirring concerns among Americas allies.  I get a lot of questions from our European counterparts on our election process this time in general, said Breedlove, who did not mention Trump by name. And I think they see a very different sort of public discussion than they have in the past.  While not confirming the content of private diplomatic contacts, some foreign officials acknowledged their governments concerns about Trump.  A British official noted that in January, Prime Minister David Cameron said: ""What Donald Trump says is, in my view, not only wrong, but actually it makes the work we need to do to confront and defeat the extremists more difficult.""RECOMMENDED: Apple users targeted in first known Mac ransomware campaign A Chinese official referred to a statement last week from Chinas foreign ministry spokeswoman. Asked whether China was concerned about Trumps proposal to place high tariffs on Chinese goods, Hua Chunyin declined to comment on specific candidates. But she said I want to stress that China and the United States have major responsibilities in maintaining international political and economic stability.  Representatives of other countries publicly attacked by Trump, including Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam either had no comment or did not respond to requests for comments.  Several American foreign policy experts said foreign diplomats have complained to them as well.  All foreign diplomats Ive talked to are amazed at the Trump phenomenon and worried about it, especially in the Middle East and Europe, said Elliott Abrams, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank who handled Middle East affairs at the National Security Council from 2001 to 2009 under then-President George W. Bush.  (Reporting by Mark Hosenball; additional reporting by Jonathan Landay, Phil Stewart, David Brunnstrom, and Emily Flitter; editing by Stuart Grudgings.)  This article was funded in part by SAP.

Factbox: The race to the U.S. presidential nominations: How delegates are selected ,"The Democratic and Republican nominees for the Nov. 8 presidential election are decided in a series of state-by-state contests. The key to winning the nomination for each party is ultimately not about the popular vote, but about securing the number of delegates needed to win the nomination at each partys convention - July 18-21 in Cleveland for the Republicans and July 25-28 in Philadelphia for the Democrats. The following is a guide to the nominating process: Q: Is the delegate selection process the same for the Republican and Democratic parties? A: No. The parties set their own rules. One thing that is the same is that at each party convention, a candidate needs to reach only a simple majority of the delegate votes to win the nomination. Q: How many delegates are there? A: The Democratic convention will be attended by about 4,763 delegates, with 2,382 delegates needed to win the nomination. The Republican convention will be attended by 2,472 delegates, with 1,237 delegates needed to win. Q: I keep hearing about superdelegates. Are they different from other delegates? Do both the Republicans and Democrats have superdelegates? A: Superdelegates, officially known as unpledged delegates, are a sort of wild card in the nominating process, but only the Democrats have them. The category was created for the 1984 Democratic convention, and according to political scientists, they are a legacy of the 1980 convention when there was a fight for the nomination between President Jimmy Carter, who was seeking a second term in the White House, and Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts. Members of Congress were frustrated by their lack of influence, because delegates elected to support one candidate could not switch to support another. So Democratic members of the House of Representatives led an effort to win a role for themselves. That resulted in the creation of superdelegates. Unlike other delegates, superdelegates may change what candidate they are supporting right up to the convention. There is no fixed number of superdelegates because the group is defined by various categories whose members change from one election cycle to another. Here is who gets to be a superdelegate:  All Democratic members of the House of Representatives and the Senate; the Democratic governors; the Democratic president and vice president of the United States; former Democratic presidents and vice presidents; former Democratic leaders of the U.S. Senate; former Democratic speakers of the House and former Democratic minority leaders. Throw in the members of the Democratic National Committee and the former chairs of the DNC and you finally have the whole pool of superdelegates. Q: What about the other delegates? Do they get to choose which candidate to support? A: Both the Democratic and Republican parties send delegates to their conventions based on the popular vote in the primary elections and caucuses held in each of the 50 states. But the parties have different rules on how delegates are allotted to a candidate. The Democratic Party applies uniform rules to all states. In each state, delegates are allocated in proportion to the percentage of the primary or caucus vote in each district. But a candidate must win at least 15 percent of the vote to be allocated any delegates. The Republican Party lets states determine their own rules, although it does dictate some things. Some states award delegates proportionate to the popular vote, although most such states have a minimum percentage that a candidate must reach to win any delegates. Some other states use the winner-take-all method, in which the candidate with the highest percentage of the popular vote is awarded all the delegates. Other states use a combination of the two methods. States that use the proportionate method may instead use the winner-take-all method if one candidate wins more than 50 percent of the popular vote.  In addition, the Republican Party requires that all states with nominating contests held between March 1 and March 14 use the proportional method, meaning that all the states holding votes on Super Tuesday will have to award delegates proportionally.  Q: What happens to delegates if a candidate drops out of the race? A: Another good question, because we have certainly seen that happen this year. For the Democratic Party, in every state, delegates are reallocated to the remaining candidates. For the Republican Party, it varies by state. In some states, delegates are required to stick with their original candidate at least through the first ballot at the Republican National Convention. In some other states, if a candidate drops out, his or her delegates may immediately pledge to another candidate. There is also a middle ground in which those delegates are reallocated to the remaining candidates.

"Amid state dinner glamor, a serious agenda for Obama-Trudeau talks","OTTAWA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Canadas charismatic Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will be traveling to Washington this week for talks with U.S. President Barack Obama, hoping to revitalize a frayed relationship and draw rare attention to Canadian issues. Trudeaus Liberals came to power in November by ousting the right-wing Conservative leader Stephen Harper, whose ties with Washington deteriorated as he hectored Obama in a failed bid to gain approval for a major Canada-U.S. pipeline. Trudeau, who has basked in international media attention since coming to power and whose progressive politics are much more in tune with Obamas, will attend a state dinner Thursday, becoming the first Canadian leader to do so since 1997. We want to strengthen our relationship with the United States at a time when it is key for our agenda of economic growth, Foreign Minister Stephane Dion said in an interview on Monday.  Canada sends 75 percent of its exports to the United States. It is also the United States largest trading partner and biggest supplier of oil, but has found it hard to stand out. Wed sometimes like to think that Americans would pay attention to us from time to time, Trudeau said in an interview with the CBS television show 60 Minutes that aired on Sunday. Trudeau will press his message on Thursday, holding talks with Obama, lunching with Secretary of State John Kerry and then attending the state dinner. Canada wants to avoid a fresh trade fight over its softwood lumber exports, while the United States will reiterate long-standing concerns about how much information Ottawa shares on terror suspects, say officials involved with the talks. The two sides are also set to sign a declaration committing to the fight against climate change, sources said. Canadas not an issue that gets a lot of attention normally, said a senior U.S. administration official. (But) Id be hard-pressed to identify a relationship thats more important day in, day out, and that affects more Americans day in, day out. Trudeau has a higher profile than any Canadian leader since his father, former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, was in power four decades ago. The New York Times and Vogue magazine are among the U.S. outlets that have run sympathetic profiles about him. Still, his visit may be overshadowed by the raucous race between Republican candidates vying to run for the White House. Thursdays dinner coincides with a Republican debate in the battleground state of Florida. ",politicsNews,"March 7, 2016 ",1
"Flint becomes U.S. Democratic flash point, but residents want action","FLINT, Mich. (Reuters) - The Flint water crisis has united Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders in outrage, but some residents suffering through the citys major public health scandal want more than talking points from the presidential contenders. As Flint becomes the focal point of the Michigan primary battle when it hosts a nationally televised debate on Sunday, residents want to see Clinton and Sanders push harder for funding to replace the citys crumbling water pipes, pay for long-term medical needs and lower their water bills. We dont want our pain to be exploited as a political backdrop. We need more from both of the candidates, said Nayyirah Shariff, a Flint resident and co-founder of the activist Flint Democracy Defense League who has met with both Clinton and Sanders. The crisis in Flint, a predominantly black city of 100,000,  was triggered when an emergency city manager installed by Governor Rick Snyder switched the citys water supply from Lake Huron to the nearby Flint River to save money. The change corroded Flints aging pipes and released lead and other toxins into the water supply, exposing thousands of residents including children to high lead levels that have sparked serious health problems. The crisis has sparked national outrage and led to calls for Snyder to resign. Both Democratic presidential contenders have raced to condemn the water contamination and criticize Republican Snyder for a slow state response, linking it to broader racial and economic inequities. But Melissa Mays, who has suffered seizures since the contamination and has three children with elevated lead levels in their blood, said she has not gone to local events where Clinton and Sanders met with residents. Im not going to be used like that. Im not going to be a token, said Mays, founder of Water You Fighting For?, another activist group. Do something first, then Ill show up. President Barack Obama declared a state of emergency in Flint in January, but lawmakers in Congress have been unable to agree on a funding package to replace aging pipes. The issue will get a full national airing from the Democratic presidential candidates in a debate in Flint scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. EST on Sunday.  Republican presidential candidates have steered clear of  Flint on the campaign trail, but when U.S. Senator Marco Rubio was asked about Flint during Thursdays debate in Detroit he defended Snyder and said the politicizing of the crisis was unfair. The U.S. presidential election is in November. Both Clinton and Sanders, who are vying for support from black voters in Michigan and nationally, have highlighted the crisis in Flint as an example of racial and economic inequality. Clinton was quick to jump on the issue, sending aides to Flint to meet with local officials, visiting the city on Feb. 7 and pressing for adding the debate in Flint. She was rewarded with an endorsement from Flint Mayor Karen Weaver and several black pastors in the region. Sanders also waded into the controversy, quickly calling for Snyders resignation, but he did not visit Flint until Feb. 25, more than two weeks after Clinton. Clinton gets credit from some residents for her aggressive approach, even if some see it as political expediency. She has certainly tried to bring a great deal of awareness to what has gone in Flint, said Rev. Allen Overton, a member of the Flint-area Concerned Pastors for Social Action group and a Clinton supporter. Sanders is trying to catch up. The Rev. Dan Scheid of St. Pauls Episcopal Church in Flint said the crisis raises questions about race and class - issues ripe for political exploitation. The cynic in me would say there is an understandable level of opportunism taking place, Scheid said. But any attention the candidates can bring in putting this injustice in front of the country is helpful. Keri Webber, whose entire family has been afflicted with an array of illnesses, including a daughter with lead in her bones, said she was frustrated by the parade of politicians expressing sympathy for Flint but taking few concrete steps to help. The Democrats are trying to build a name off us, and the Republicans couldnt tell you where Flint, Michigan, is, Webber said.

"Mexican president says won't pay for Trump wall, makes Hitler warning"," MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexicos president has said his country will not pay for White House hopeful Donald Trumps proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and likened his strident tone to the ascent of dictators like Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.  President Enrique Pena Nietos comments, published in Mondays Excelsior newspaper, were among the most critical public comments yet by a foreign leader of the New York billionaire.  READ MORE: Diplomats sound alarm bells over 'President Trump' Trump, front-runner to win the Republican Party presidential nomination for the Nov. 8 election, has sparked outrage in Mexico with his campaign vow to build a wall along the southern U.S. border to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs, and to make Mexico pay for it.  Asked by Excelsior whether there was a scenario under which Mexico would pay if Trump won the presidency, Pena Nieto was clear. There is no scenario, he said. I have to say that I regret (the plan), and of course, I cant agree with this American politicians position.  Trump, who has also aroused concern among many in his own party with his proposals, has accused Mexico of sending rapists and drug runners across the border and vowed to increase fees on some Mexican visas and all border crossing cards to help make Mexico pay for the wall.  Pena Nieto attacked the populism of the Trump campaign, which he said sought to put forward very easy, simple solutions to problems that are obviously not that easy to solve.  And there have been episodes in human history, unfortunately, where these expressions of this strident rhetoric have only led to very ominous situations in the history of humanity, the Mexican president added.  Thats how Mussolini got in, thats how Hitler got in, they took advantage of a situation, a problem perhaps, which humanity was going through at the time, after an economic crisis.  And I think what (they) put forward ended up at what we know today from history, in global conflagration. We dont want that happening anywhere in the world, Pena Nieto said.  Mexican Finance Minister Luis Videgaray called Trumps wall a terrible idea in an interview last week, while former Mexican presidents Felipe Calderon and Vicente Fox have both compared Trump to Hitler.  In spite of his comments, Pena Nieto stressed that his administration will seek to reach agreement and maintain a respectful relationship with whoever wins the U.S. presidency.  Foreign diplomats are expressing alarm to U.S. government officials about what they say are Trumps inflammatory and insulting public statements.  ",politicsNews,"March 7, 2016 ",1
"Clinton, Sanders both say they can beat Trump during feisty Michigan debate","FLINT, Mich. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential contenders Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton sparred in a debate on Sunday over who had the best chance to beat Republican front-runner Donald Trump, and mocked the level of discourse in the Republican White House race. Near the end of a Michigan debate that featured sharp clashes over trade and the auto industry bailout, as well as a lengthy discussion of religion, Clinton and Sanders both said they could not wait to face the brash billionaire in the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. I think Donald Trumps bigotry, his bullying, his bluster, are not going to wear well on the American people, Clinton said. We have to end the divisiveness, we have to unify the country. Sanders said he would love to run against Trump and noted many opinion polls showed him faring better against him than Clinton did. He and Clinton urged voters to compare the substance of their debate with the Republican versions, which last week featured name-calling and Trump defending his penis size. We are, if elected president, going to invest a lot of money in mental health, Sanders said, then cracked a joke. And when you watch these Republican debates, you know why we need to invest in mental health. Trump frequently says he will beat either Clinton or Sanders. I am the one person that she does not want to run against, he said of Clinton on Saturday.  The debate in Flint, which is suffering a water contamination and public health crisis, came as Sanders has struggled to slow Clintons march to the presidential nomination. Sanders picked up some good news on Sunday with a projected win in Maines caucus. Clinton, 68, a former secretary of state and first lady,  has spoken on the campaign trail of the need for more love and kindness, a contrast to Trumps rhetoric about his plans to deport illegal immigrants and temporarily bar Muslims from entering the country. I dont intend to get into the gutter with whoever they nominate, but instead to lift our sights, Clinton said in the debate. Describing herself as a praying person, she said it was hard to imagine living under the pressure of the White House without being able to fall back on prayer and on my faith. Sanders, asked if he was deliberately keeping his Jewish faith in the background on the campaign trail, said his fathers family was wiped out in the Holocaust. He described going shopping with his mother as a boy in Brooklyn, New York, and seeing people with numbers on their arms from Nazi concentration camps. I am very proud of being Jewish, and that is an essential part of who I am as a human being, Sanders said. Earlier, the two candidates exchanged angry jabs over trade, with Sanders accusing Clinton of backing disastrous trade policies that moved manufacturing jobs out of cities like Flint and Detroit and shifted them overseas. But Clinton said Sanders opposition to the 2009 auto bailout, a crucial issue in a state that is home to the U.S. auto industry, would have cost millions of jobs. The bailout, which Clinton supported, passed Congress and has been credited with helping save the U.S. industry. Sanders, 74 a U.S. senator from Vermont and democratic socialist, also questioned the sincerity of Clintons conversion to opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal. The two contenders cut each other off on several occasions, a rare occurrence in a race that has been much more polite than the raucous Republican presidential campaign. Excuse me, Im talking, Sanders said to Clinton when she tried to interrupt. If youre going to talk, tell the whole story, Clinton responded. Sanders pressed his charge that Clinton was too close to Wall Street and demanded again that she release the transcript of paid speeches she has given to Wall Street firms. Clinton said she would release them when all the candidates, including Republicans, also release transcripts of similar talks. Throwing up his hands, Sanders said: Ill release it. Here it is. There aint nothing! I dont give speeches to Wall Street! The debate was held in Flint to highlight the citys water contamination crisis, and both candidates expressed outrage at Flints plight and demanded Republican Governor Rick Snyders resignation. The crisis in Flint, a predominantly black city of 100,000, was triggered when an emergency city manager installed by Snyder switched the citys water supply to the nearby Flint River from Lake Michigan to save money. The change corroded Flints aging pipes and released lead and other toxins into the water supply, exposing thousands of residents including children to high lead levels that have sparked serious health problems.

Ex-Marine chosen to direct U.S. extradition efforts,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice has hired a retired Marine Corps major general to head the office in charge of bringing overseas criminal defendants to the United States for trial, a task that has grown in importance as the work of U.S. prosecutors increasingly crosses national borders. Vaughn Ary, a lawyer who was in the Marine Corps for 28 years, has been chosen as director of the departments Office of International Affairs, according to an internal personnel announcement seen by Reuters.  A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the appointment. Ary could not be reached for comment.  Ary resigned last year as the convening authority for U.S. military commissions, a job that put him in charge of operations at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, tribunals. He had angered some defense lawyers and military judges by pushing a plan to increase the pace of trials at the Guantanamo naval base by requiring judges to live there. The plan was scrapped. The Justice Departments Office of International Affairs is in the middle of negotiating the extradition of drug kingpin Joaquin El Chapo Guzman from Mexico. In another case, it has asked countries such as Switzerland and Honduras to hand over defendants in a sweeping investigation of corruption in soccer and its world governing body, FIFA.  The office is also charged with negotiating the transfer of evidence across borders through agreements known as mutual legal assistance treaties. More resources are going toward the office as a result of the increase in workload, Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell of the Justice Departments Criminal Division said on Friday in a speech at a legal conference in San Diego. Caldwell said she was very excited about a new director of the Office of International Affairs, and said that the person would start on Monday. She did not name the person.

"German minister calls Trump a threat, Merkel lauds Clinton","BERLIN (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel has branded leading U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump a threat to peace and prosperity while Chancellor Angela Merkel said it had always been a pleasure to work with Democrat Hillary Clinton.  The comments by Gabriel, Germanys vice chancellor and leader of the Social Democrats, are the clearest sign yet that ruling politicians in Europe are increasingly worried about the outcome of the U.S. presidential elections. Whether Donald Trump, Marine le Pen or Geert Wilders - all these right-wing populists are not only a threat to peace and social cohesion, but also to economic development, Gabriel told Welt am Sonntag newspaper in an interview published on Sunday. Gabriel said that Trump and French National Front leader Le Pen were promising voters a way back into a fairytale world in which economic activity only happened within national borders but that history had shown such isolated economies had no prospect. We have to make the effort to explain how we want to shape globalization in a fair way, Gabriel said. Politicians in Germany and elsewhere in Europe have watched nervously as businessman and reality TV star Trump has moved from long shot to front-runner of the Republicans seeking the partys nomination ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. Trump has described Merkels welcoming policy towards refugees as insane and predicted it would cause rioting in Germany. He has also praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been at odds with Europe since Moscows annexation of Ukraines Crimea region two years ago. Merkel told Bild am Sonntag newspaper in an interview she did not know Trump personally. When asked about his attacks against her refugee policy, the chancellor said: I dont see any reason why I should reply to him. At the same time, Merkel said of Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton: I value her long political experience, her commitment for womens rights, family issues and health care. I value her strategic thinking and that she is a strong supporter of the transatlantic partnership. Whenever I had the chance to work together with Hillary Clinton, it was a great pleasure. Germany does not face a federal election until next year. But a new anti-immigrant party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), has emerged as a threat to Merkels conservatives. The AfD wants Germany to shut its border to migrants and use force to repel them if necessary.  (Reporting by Michael Nienaber; Editing by Ralph Boulton) This article was funded in part by SAP.

"Cruz, Trump split four states in setback for Republican establishment","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz split victories in four nominating contests with front-runner Donald Trump on Saturday, bolstering Cruzs argument that he represents the partys best chance to stop the brash New York billionaire. The results were a repudiation of a Republican establishment that has bristled at the prospect of either Cruz or Trump winning the partys nomination and has largely lined up behind U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who was shut out in all four contests. I think its time that he dropped out of the race, Trump said of Rubio after the contests. I want Ted one on one. Cruz won Kansas and Maine on Saturday, while Trump won the bigger states of Louisiana and Kentucky, holding onto his lead in the race for the Republican nomination for the November 8 presidential election, even though Cruz captured more delegates on Saturday. The next big contest, and a crucial one, will be Tuesdays primary in the industrial state of Michigan. Republicans in three other states, Mississippi, Idaho and Hawaii, also will vote on Tuesday. Puerto Rico Republicans will vote on Sunday. In the Democratic race, front-runner Hillary Clinton won in Louisiana, and her rival Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, won in Kansas and Nebraska, in results that did not substantially change Clintons big delegate lead. Mainstream Republicans have blanched at Trumps calls to build a wall on the border with Mexico, round up and deport 11 million undocumented immigrants and temporarily bar all Muslims from entering the United States. But the partys establishment has not been much happier with Cruz, who has alienated many party leaders in Washington. It looks like it will be the angry Trump voters against the purist conservative Cruz voters, said Washington-based Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. The establishment is just being left out. A spokesman for Rubio, who spent the past week launching harsh personal attacks on Trump, said the senator would push on with an eye on the March 15 contest in Florida. After we win the Florida primary, the map, the momentum and the money is going to be on our side, spokesman Alex Conant said in a statement. Cruz, a first-term U.S. senator from Texas who has promoted himself as more of a true conservative than Trump, said the results showed he was gaining momentum in the race to catch the real estate mogul. Cruz, 45, has run as an outsider bent on shaking up the Republican establishment in Washington. A favorite of evangelicals, he has called for the United States to carpet bomb the Islamic State militant group and has pledged to eliminate the tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service and four cabinet agencies and to enact a balanced budget amendment. The scream you hear, the howl that comes from Washington, D.C., is utter terror at what We the People are doing together, Cruz told supporters in Coeur dAlene, Idaho, after his early win in Kansas. What were seeing is the public coming together, libertarians coming together, men and women who love the Constitution coming together and uniting and standing as one behind this campaign, Cruz said. Trump, 69, has a substantial lead in the delegates needed to secure the nomination at the Republican National Convention, but since winning seven of the 11 contests on Super Tuesday he has come under withering fire from a Republican establishment worried he will lead the party to defeat in Novembers election. [nL2N16C08F] But endorsements from establishment Republicans have failed to sway voters. Rubio won the backing of Kansas Governor Sam Brownback but still came in third there. The four Republican contests on Saturday together accounted for just 155 delegates. Cruz won 64 delegates on Saturday, while Trump took 49. The races on Saturday were open only to registered Republicans, excluding the independent and disaffected Democratic voters who have helped Trumps surge to the lead. The anti-Trump forces have a short window to stop the caustic businessman, who ahead of Saturday had accumulated 319 of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination at Julys Republican national convention, outpacing Cruz, who had 226 delegates. On March 15, the delegate-rich states of Florida, Illinois, Ohio, Missouri and North Carolina will vote. Both Florida and Ohio use the winner-take-all method to allocate Republican delegates, making the stakes in those states particularly high. All of the Republican contests on Saturday, and through March 14, award delegates proportionate to the popular vote, although some states set minimum thresholds to qualify for any delegates. If Trump takes both Florida and Ohio he would be nearly impossible to stop. There are a total of 358 delegates at stake in the five states voting March 15, including 99 in Florida and 66 in Ohio.  On the Democratic side, Clinton has opened up a big delegate lead and Sanders might have a tough time making up the difference. All states in the Democratic race award their delegates proportionally, meaning Clinton can keep piling up delegates even in states she loses. The three states holding Democratic contests on Saturday had a total of 109 delegates at stake. The early estimates were that Clinton, who appeared headed to a smashing nearly 50-point win in Louisiana, had won at least 48 delegates on Tuesday and Sanders 37. But Sanders made it clear he was not planning to end his White House quest anytime soon. We have the momentum. We have a path toward victory. Our campaign is just getting started, he said in a statement after his wins on Saturday. ",politicsNews,"March 5, 2016 ",1

"Appellate judges Garland, Srinivasan considered for U.S. top court: NYT","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is vetting federal appellate judges Merrick Garland and Sri Srinivasan as possible nominees to the Supreme Court to replace late Justice Antonin Scalia, the New York Times reported on Friday.  The FBI has been conducting background checks on Garland and Srinivasan, the Times said, citing a person with knowledge of the process. Scalia, a long-serving conservative justice, died on Feb. 13. Srinivasan, 49, has served on the U.S. Court of Appeals since he was confirmed on a 97-0 bipartisan vote in the U.S. Senate in May 2013. As a senior Justice Department lawyer in 2013, he was part of the legal team that successfully urged the high court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act, a law that restricted the definition of marriage to heterosexual couples for the purposes of federal benefits. Garland, 63, was appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1997 and became the chief judge in 2013. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Republicans say the decision on who to nominate to the Supreme Court should be left to the next president, who will be elected on Nov. 8. Under the U.S. Constitution, the president nominates Supreme Court justices and the Senate must confirm them. Earlier this week, the Times said that federal appellate Judge Jane Kelly was being vetted. Last month the National Law Journal reported that Ketanji Brown Jackson, a federal trial judge in Washington, was also being considered. Without Scalia, the court has four conservative and four liberal justices, meaning any potential Obama nominee could tip the court to the left for the first time in decades. Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval, a moderate Republican, took himself out of consideration for appointment to the Supreme Court recently. ",politicsNews,"March 5, 2016 ",1
Republican 'Dump Trump' effort struggles to gain traction,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. (Reuters) - A plan to block Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump struggled to gain traction on Friday as rival candidates rejected it, while Democrats reveled in the chaos they hoped would boost their chances of keeping the White House.  The countrys top elected Republican, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, said he was not interested in an effort to draft him into the White House race. And U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, a conservative presidential hopeful, ruled out a deal to pick a compromise Republican candidate at the partys July convention, which senior party figures see as their best chance to stop the unpredictable billionaire.   The D.C. power brokers will drop someone in who is exactly to the liking of the establishment. If that will happen we will have a manifold revolt in this country, Cruz said at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington. You want to beat Donald Trump, you beat Donald Trump with the voters, he said.  Party leaders worry Trump would not be able to beat Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in the election, but time is running out after he won most of the states that voted in this weeks Super Tuesday. Senior Republicans also fear Trumps plans to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and ban Muslims from entering the United States will turn off voters in November and upset U.S. allies. Others note his past support for liberal policies and question whether he has any agenda other than advancing himself. I dont think he actuallycarries the conservative mantle. Hes a little too crass for me, said Michele Minter, a San Diego executive assistant who was attending CPAC. Trump, a former reality TV star, often plays by his own set of rules. He canceled plans to speak at CPAC, normally an essential stop for ambitious Republicans, and will instead attend a rally in Kansas.  The real estate magnate, who is drawing support from many blue-collar Republicans concerned about illegal immigration and stagnant wages, has won most Republican nominating contests and leads in many polls for the primary contests still to come. Im not a normal Republican, he said to huge cheers at a rally in Warren, Michigan. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, the only candidate to ever challenge Trumps months-long lead in opinion polls, officially ended his White House bid. There are a lot of people who love me, they just wont vote for me, Carson said in a speech at CPAC, held in National Harbor, Maryland. A new group called the Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan filed papers with the Federal Election Commission on Thursday, seeking to raise money to push Ryan as a Republican alternative. Ryan, a budget wonk who was the Republican vice presidential candidate in 2012, is seen by many in the party as a unifier after he took the speakers job last year to unite establishment Republican lawmakers and conservative upstarts in the House. He is flattered, but not interested, Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said in an email on Friday. As Trump cements his front-runner status, senior party figures hope to deny him enough delegates to clinch the nomination, which would give them the chance to choose a compromise candidate at their convention in Cleveland. The last time that happened at a Republican convention was  in 1948 when Thomas Dewey was nominated.  Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said there was an 85 to 90 percent chance that the party will not face that scenario this year. Mitt Romney and John McCain, the partys last two presidential nominees, called on Republicans to halt Trumps rise by backing whichever candidate was strongest in their state, a form of tactical voting.  Few elected officials are rallying behind the Dump Trump banner. The partys 31 state governors, for example, are not lining up behind an alternative. Only five have endorsed Florida Senator Marco Rubio and one has backed Cruz, in a sharp contrast to previous years when governors overwhelmingly endorsed the partys eventual nominee. Rubio has only one state so far and is gearing up for what could be a make-or-break contest in his home state on March 15. Cruz said Saturday he planned to open 10 campaign offices there, in what could be an effort to force the rival senator out of the race. Trump is expected to extend his lead on Saturday, when a total of 155 delegates are at stake in Kansas, Louisiana, Maine and Kentucky.  Democrats were happy to let Republicans fight amongst themselves. We can sit back and let them light their own dumpster fire and wait until theyre finished, said Eddie Vale, spokesman for American Bridge, a Clinton-allied group which collects negative research on Republican candidates. Theyre giving us so much great video footage that we could run ads between now and November of nothing but Republicans attacking Trump, Vale told Reuters.                 Nationally, Trump has the support of 41 percent of Republican voters, compared to 19 percent who back Cruz and 16 percent who back Rubio, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling data.

Jenner's offer to be 'trans ambassador' for Cruz draws some fire,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Reality star Caitlyn Jenners offer to be a trans ambassador to U.S. Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz drew criticism on Friday from some members of the LGBT community, but major transgender rights organizations stayed out of the fray. Jenner told gay and lesbian publication The Advocate in an interview posted this week that she admired Cruz despite the social conservatives stance on transgender issues. The 66-year-old Olympic gold medalist turned television personality called Cruz a great constitutionalist and said she would like to advise him on questions relating to her community.   Yes, trans ambassador to the president of the United States, so we can say, Ted, love what youre doing but heres whats going on, Jenner, who last year became the most high-profile American to transition to a different gender, told The Advocate. The muted reaction to Jenners support for Cruz appeared to show the high level of esteem she enjoys in the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. But that did not stop some of its members speaking out. Doing my best to not send tweets to a woman I respect for her courage, but dang it, @Caitlyn_Jenner youre killing me with Cruz support! Chely Wright, the first country music star to come out as gay, wrote in a post on Twitter. Some in the LGBT community took a more pointed stand, citing Cruzs opposition to same-sex marriage and his criticism of government efforts to allow students to use a bathroom that conforms to their gender identity. In January, at a campaign stop in Iowa, Cruz said inflicting transgender students on teachers by allowing them to use a faculty restroom in line with their gender identity was better than having them share a bathroom with other students, according to video from NBC News. Zack Ford, the LGBT editor at ThinkProgress, a website affiliated with the left-leaning Center for American Progress, wrote in a post that Jenners support for Republicans like Cruz taints her credibility.  Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said Jenners comments highlight the fact a significant share of transgender people are Republicans.    One would hope that transgender people would support philosophies that are helpful and not harmful to trans people, she said, adding that Jenner might have taken that into consideration before offering her support to Cruz. A representative for the gay rights group GLAAD declined to comment and a spokeswoman for Cruz could not be reached.

Obama to visit Patagonian tourist city Bariloche on Argentina trip,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and the first lady will visit the lake-side Patagonian tourist city of Bariloche later this month during an official trip to Argentina, a U.S. diplomat told local radio on Friday. The trip will follow the couples visit to Cuba on March 21 and 22, another major step toward ending decades of animosity between former Cold War foes. They will meet with newly elected Argentine President Mauricio Macri on March 23 and fly to Bariloche the following day, Kevin Sullivan, deputy chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in Buenos Aires, told Radio Mitre. The stopover in ski-destination Bariloche, known for its crystal clear lakes and panoramic mountain vistas, appeared to be first lady Michelle Obamas idea, Sullivan said. I believe she heard what Bariloche is like ... and it seemed to her it would be a good place to share a little family time, Sullivan said. Relations have improved between Argentina and the United States since Macri took office in December. Macri has moved to open Latin Americas No. 3 economy to foreign investment by ditching trade and currency controls enacted by his predecessor. It seems to us to be a good moment for President Obama to get to know Argentina and have a dialogue with President Macri, Sullivan said. The agenda will include international cooperation, terrorism, human rights and energy investment. Argentina has some of the worlds largest untapped shale oil and natural gas formations. China is a major investor in Argentinas energy and grains sectors.  March 24 will be the 40th anniversary of the 1976 coup that installed a military dictatorship, which the United States initially supported. Argentina returned to democracy in 1983. Adolfo Perez Esquivel, who won the Nobel peace prize for his human rights work during the dictatorship, wrote an open letter to Obama this week saying that if the U.S. president stayed in Buenos Aires on the 24th, many Argentines would see that as a provocation. Marches and demonstrations in honor of the victims of the military junta are planned for that date in the Argentine capital. ",politicsNews,"March 5, 2016 ",1

Supreme Court temporarily blocks Louisiana abortion law,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court, two days after hearing a major abortion case from Texas, on Friday temporarily blocked a Louisiana law imposing regulations on doctors who perform abortions in a move that would allow two recently closed clinics to reopen. In a brief order, the court granted a request by abortion providers seeking to reinstate a lower-court injunction that blocked the Republican-backed 2014 law, which required doctors to obtain a formal affiliation with a local hospital. The abortion providers contend the law was designed to shut down abortion clinics by requiring hospital admitting privileges that are difficult for their doctors to secure. Louisiana will now have four clinics in total. The order noted that one of the eight justices, conservative Clarence Thomas, said he would have denied the application. The order said the courts action was in line with its decision in June to temporarily block part of a Texas abortion law that was challenged by abortion providers in a high-profile case. The justices heard oral arguments in that case on Wednesday. The Louisiana law mandates that physicians who perform abortions have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the abortion clinic. The regulation matches one in the Texas law. U.S. District Judge John deGravelles in January granted a preliminary injunction sought by abortion providers, finding the law violated the constitutional right to an abortion established by the Supreme Court in 1973. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked that decision on Feb. 24, allowing the law to go into effect. The high courts action sent mixed signals on how it might rule in the Texas case, in part because the justices previously allowed the Texas admitting privileges provision to go into effect. The action could suggest the court has greater concerns about admitting privileges requirements than were indicated during Wednesdays argument in the Texas case. Fridays move effectively put Louisianas law on hold while the justices prepare a ruling, expected by the end of June, in the Texas case. Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents abortion providers in both cases, welcomed the courts action. These underhanded tactics to cut off womens access to safe, legal abortion simply cannot stand, Northup said.  The Texas case also involves a separate provision that requires clinics to have costly, hospital-grade facilities. The Louisiana law was signed by Republican then-Governor Bobby Jindal in 2014.

White House adviser Rhodes to meet with Cuban Americans in Miami next week,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obamas deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes will travel to Miami next week to meet with leaders from the Cuban-American community to allay concerns about Obamas historic trip to Cuba later this month, a White House official told Reuters. Miami has long been at the heart of the Cuban-American community, and this trip will provide an opportunity to continue the important dialogue about the presidents efforts to normalize relations with Cuba, the official said. Rhodes, who helped negotiate the thaw in Washingtons relations with the island nation, will meet with human rights advocates, religious leaders, and private sector representatives during his March 11 trip. Obama goes to Havana in mid-March in what will be the first visit by a U.S. president to the Caribbean nation since 1928.  Republicans and some leaders in the Cuban-American community  oppose the trip, believing it will give legitimacy to the islands Communist government. Rhodes will seek to allay those concerns and discuss what the president hopes to achieve by going to Havana, the official said. Obama plans to meet with dissidents as well as President Raul Castro during his stay in Cuba. ",politicsNews,"March 4, 2016 ",1
Foreign policy thinkers praised by Trump have divergent views,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If Americans were looking for clarity on leading Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps world views, they might  have come away disappointed from Thursday nights debate. Asked who he trusts on national security, Trump had warm words for three men with world views that differ from one another, and who diverge sharply on some key issues from Trump himself. They are former diplomat Richard Haass and retired U.S. Army officers Gen. Jack Keane and Col. Jack Jacobs. His mention of the eclectic trio did little to satisfy mounting calls for him to announce a list of his campaign foreign policy advisors, who traditionally take top posts should he be elected. His debate comments appeared to be more words of admiration for the three men than a signal he was forming the nucleus of a national security team. Trump has been rejected by a significant swath of his partys foreign policy establishment. Almost 110 Republican foreign policy veterans have signed a letter pledging to oppose Trump, saying his proposals would undermine U.S. security. The three men Trump mentioned have different views of the 2003 Iraq invasion, arguably the most controversial foreign policy decision in a generation. Trump says he opposed the war, calling it a disastrous intervention and accusing the administration of then President George W. Bush of misleading Americans. Keane is a defense hawk who helped devise the 2007 Iraq surge  a move to send tens of thousands more U.S. troops to Iraq to quell sectarian strife  and served as an informal consultant to Bush. Keane told Reuters on Friday he has never spoken to Trump. Keane, now chairman of the board of the Institute for the Study of War think tank, said he has briefed seven presidential candidates from both parties, whom he declined to identify.  I dont comment publicly on any candidate, their proposals, their policies. I have never done. I wont do it, he said. Haass is a centrist foreign policy thinker and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank seen as a fixture of the U.S. foreign policy establishment. The State Departments policy planning director at the time of the Iraq invasion, he wrote later that he was largely against the war. I did not believe in the Iraq war, Haass said in a 2009 interview with National Public Radio. Trump has proposed barring Muslims from entering the United States, demanded that Mexico fund a wall to control illegal immigration across the U.S. border, and praised Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has called for building up the U.S. military while also saying he wants allies to pick up more of the burden in conflicts such as Syria and Iraq. He has vowed to destroy Islamic State. A spokeswoman for Haass, Iva Zoric, said that he briefed Trump on foreign policy in August 2015. In a tweet late on Thursday, Haass wrote: I do not endorse candidates. What I have done is offered to brief all candidates, & have briefed several, D(emocrat) & R(epublican) alike. Jacobs, now a frequent television commentator, won the Medal of Honor, the highest U.S. military decoration, in the Vietnam War. He has expressed skepticism regarding large scale American military interventions in the Middle East and has suggested that waterboarding, an interrogation technique that many call torture and that Trump has endorsed, is ineffective.  Trump softened his stance on torture on Friday, saying he would not order the U.S. military to break international laws on how to treat terrorism suspects. Jacobs has been critical of political leaders who send American troops on missions without what he considers a well-defined strategy. Jacobs, writing in 2007, criticized the post-invasion plan for Iraq, including the foolish decision to disband the Iraqi army. Pressed on Thursday night to identify his foreign policy advisers, Trump said that Haas and Keane were excellent and that he liked Jacobs very much. Jacobs declined to comment on whether he was helping Trump. I have many people that I think are really excellent but in the end its going to be my decision on national security matters, Trump said. Keane, who appears frequently before congressional committees and on television, has accused U.S. President Barack Obama of not acting forcefully to help moderates in Libya and Syria. He called Obamas 2011 withdrawal of U.S. combat forces from Iraq an absolute strategic failure, and charged that he lacks a strategy to contain the spread of Islamic State and help moderates in the region. Keane told Reuters that as a strict rule, he will not join campaigns as an advisor, nor endorse political candidates.   (Editing by Stuart Grudgings) This article was funded in part by SAP.

Republican candidate Trump reverses stance on torture,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump softened his stance on torture on Friday, saying he would not order the U.S. military to break international laws on how to treat terrorism suspects, as the top U.S. military commander was asked to weigh in on his comments. I do, however, understand that the United States is bound by laws and treaties and I will not order our military or other officials to violate those laws and will seek their advice on such matters, Trump said in a statement to the Wall Street Journal. I will not order a military officer to disobey the law. It is clear that as president I will be bound by laws just like all Americans and I will meet those responsibilities. In a Republican presidential debate on Thursday night, Trump indicated he might order the U.S. military to break the law on interrogation tactics, including waterboarding. Trump also suggested his willingness to target the families of terrorist suspects.  The exchange prompted Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a former 2016 White House contender and frequent Trump critic, to send Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a letter asking his thoughts on whether targeting relatives of terrorist suspects was legal under the laws of war and whether waterboarding or other more extreme interrogation techniques were legal for the U.S. military. Dunford has yet to make a public response to Grahams letter. Waterboarding is the practice of pouring water over someones face to mimic drowning as an interrogation tactic. Critics say it is torture. Democratic President Barack Obama banned use of the method days after taking office in 2009.  Asked during the debate what he would do if the U.S. military refused to carry out such orders, Trump said, They wont refuse. Theyre not going to refuse me. Believe me. Can you imagine? Can you imagine these people, these animals over in the Middle East, that chop off heads, sitting around talking and seeing that were having a hard problem with waterboarding? We should go for waterboarding and we should go tougher than waterboarding, Trump said on the Fox News debate.

Latest Hillary Clinton bio for kids highlights successes and failures,"POTOMAC, Md. (Reuters) - As Hillary Clinton sets her sights on becoming the first female president of the United States, the Democratic front-runner has found herself in another role - the subject of childrens books.  In Hillary Rodham Clinton: Do All the Good You Can, author Cynthia Levinson charts her rise from her youth in Park Ridge, Illinois, to her work as a U.S. senator and secretary of state. Levinson brought Clintons story this week to fourth graders at Cold Spring Elementary School in suburban Washington, whom she found were paying close attention to the presidential race.  I hope kids enjoy the book, and I hope that its thought-provoking for them, said Levinson, who went to Wellesley College with Clinton and interviewed mutual acquaintances and the former first lady for the book. The book is among several recent childrens biographies on Clinton. They include Hillary Rodham Clinton: Some Girls are Born to Lead by Michelle Markel and Jonah Winters picture book Hillary. While the books all include the theme of female strength, Levinson said she was keen to highlight both Clintons successes and failures, such as her vote for the U.S. war in Iraq and bungled healthcare initiative while first lady.  The grade-schoolers were divided over whether Clinton, 68, was the woman for the job.  Im more on Bernie Sanders side. Hillary Clinton is less direct than Bernie Sanders, said Sudhish Swain, 10, referring to Clintons rival for the Democratic nomination. Many students said they got their news about the election, which will be held in November, from the radio or school bus debates. We mostly agree that Donald Trump would not be a good president, said Tianlai Yang. Katherine Pease, 9, added: He lies, hes a hypocrite, hes a megalomaniac, and hes delusional, which, really, those four qualities arent good for a president. She showed off an op-ed piece she had submitted to the Washington Post urging Republicans to rally around one candidate to counter Trump. She said she hoped that candidate would be Ohio Governor John Kasich.  Kyle Baer said he liked Clinton but still would not vote for her if he were old enough.  The only thing I have against her is that shes already been a resident of the White House before, and I dont think she should be a resident again, he said.

"'Joe the Plumber' praises Trump, cites his 'beautiful women'","HOLLAND, Ohio (Reuters) - Joe the Plumber, the Ohio workingman who came to symbolize U.S. taxpayer frustration in the 2008 presidential election, is still angry. And like many angry voters, he likes insurgent Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump  in part because the New York billionaire dated attractive women. Hes a winner. Hes made billions. Hes dated beautiful women. His wife is a model. Thats not to sniff at. And a lot of people believe he can bring that kind of success to the White House, said Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher, 42, who shot to prominence during the 2008 campaign after then-Republican nominee John McCain seized on a confrontation Wurzelbacher had with then-Democratic candidate Barack Obama. Sitting in his Ohio house, a Ruger handgun on a table next to him, Wurzelbacher told Reuters he has yet to decide who to support but says he understands why so many people are drawn to the caustic Trump, a real-estate developer and former reality TV show host, and is unhappy with the Republican Party establishment lining up against him. He said Trumps position as an insurgent candidate who is willing to defy party leaders was a more important reason to vote for him than his wealth and the model-looks of his wife Melania. But he said he believed other voters were drawn to his larger-than-life image and glamorous lifestyle.  He also likes Ted Cruz, the conservative U.S. senator from Texas. He is scathing about Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida and the favorite of the Republican establishment to challenge Trump. And he dislikes John Kasich, the Ohio governor who narrowly trails Trump in his home state with less than two weeks until Ohios primary on March 15. Trump, 69, is the front-runner in the race for the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election, but party leaders worry policies that include building a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and temporarily banning Muslims from entering the United States will turn off voters and upset U.S. allies.    As a conservative, Wurzelbacher says he is willing to overlook Trumps previous heresies on issues such as gun control, abortion, gay marriage and even his past donations to Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner. The Obama administration, he says, is a miserable failure. In the 2008 campaign, Wurzelbacher made headlines when he asked Obama about his small business tax policy. During a videotaped exchange, Obama answered in part by saying, when you spread the wealth around, its good for everybody.   Wurzelbacher had told Obama he was interested in buying a plumbing business. Two days later McCain, Obamas opponent, cited Joe the Plumber as the quintessential American everyman who had exposed Obama as having what McCain called a socialist, wealth-distributing economic world view. It mattered little that Joe wasnt his first name. He never ultimately got a plumbing license in Ohio. But he says he was honorably discharged from the U.S. Air Force as a journeyman plumber. Soon after, Wurzelbacher appeared at rallies with McCain and his running mate, former Alaska governor Sarah Palin. He seemed enraged at Obamas economic policies.  Today, he is highly critical of Senator McCain, deriding his opposition to Trump as corrupt. They are not opposing Trump for the American people. They are doing it for their party, and I dont like that. Its control, power, greed. Trump scares them. Wurzelbacher, who had assailed unions along with Obamas decision to use taxpayer money to rescue the car manufacturers Chrysler and General Motors from bankruptcy in 2009, drew much criticism when it emerged that he took a job at a Chrysler plant in Toledo, Ohio, in 2014 - and joined a local union to get it. That was an experiment, Wurzelbacher said. He said he never intended to work at Chrysler full-time. He wanted to see inside a union factory so he could write about it, he said. He worked on the paint line for three months, and then left. He ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2012, winning the Republican primary for Ohios 9th congressional district but lost to Democratic Marcy Kaptur by a landslide. Wurzelbacher says his life has settled down since the madness of 2008. He got married five years ago. He has a three-year-old daughter and one-year-old son, and a 20-year-old son living in Kentucky. He now spends his time running two websites, JoeforAmerica.com, and one his wife inspired, livingloving.com. But he is disgusted by much of the debate in America. Political correctness is a huge issue. People are afraid to speak their minds. They are afraid of being labeled a racist or a homophobe. On guns, Wurzelbacher says the more people who have guns, the safer they will be. Asked how many guns he has, Wurzelbacher replied, not enough.

Democrat Clinton says China likely to commit more 'bad acts' in trade ,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton on Friday said that as the Chinese economy slows, China will engage in more damaging practices in global trade. But now that Chinas economy is slowing down we can expect even more bad acts from them, she said in a speech in Detroit. Itll look to dump products overseas to make up for lost demand at home. So we have to stop that right now. Clinton is the front runner for her partys nomination to the November presidential election.

Republican governors steer clear of 'dump-Trump' push,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As Republican leaders desperately seek ways to derail the presidential campaign of billionaire Donald Trump, many of the partys 31 state governors are staying out of the fray.  New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez endorsed Marco Rubio on Friday, making her only the 10th governor to back one of the four Republican presidential rivals left in the race. Much more typical is Governor Rick Scott of Florida, who said on Thursday he would not endorse a candidate before his states hotly contested March 15 primary. Such reluctance to commit contrasts sharply with previous elections, when governors lined up solidly behind eventual nominees, helping to winnow the field of candidates early on. The 2016 election differs because a chaotic race has divided Republicans, convincing many to keep a low profile in hopes of avoiding a possible backlash from voters who are increasingly contemptuous of party leaders, Republican officials say. Its a lose-lose political situation, said Fergus Cullen, a former New Hampshire Republican Party chairman. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie last week took a risk, after dropping out of the presidential contest himself, and endorsed Trump, the billionaire businessman. That decision has done little for either of them, according to a new poll. Almost two-thirds of 1,372 adults polled, both Republicans and Democrats, said Christies endorsement made no difference in their feelings toward Trump, the Republican front-runner. The nationwide Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted Feb 29-March 4. Christie has faced relentless criticism since he announced his support for Trump last week. Six newspapers in his home state have called on him to resign. In past elections, a governors endorsement could produce a burst of positive news coverage and the support of well-connected local leaders for a presidential contender. That would encourage other elected officials to endorse the candidate as well, creating an impression that the candidate was a favorite of those who knew best and encouraging others to drop out of the race, said David Karol, a University of Maryland political science professor who has found that endorsements were a strong predictor of electoral success between 1980 and 2004. The absence of most of the governors this late in the process really indicates the paralysis and division in Republican elite circles, Karol said. Ahead of Election Day on Nov. 8, many governors did not want to talk about Trump, who has unnerved his partys establishment with his abrasive tone and policy positions, including plans to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, deport 11 million illegal immigrants and temporarily bar Muslims from entering the country. Eighteen undecided Republican governors, contacted by Reuters, declined to be interviewed on their views of the race.  National Republican leaders are struggling for a strategy to stop Trump from becoming the nominee, as Democrats revel in the chaos they hope will boost their chances of keeping the White House. George W. Bush, elected president in 2000, had the support of 26 of the partys 30 Republican governors before primary voting even started, according to figures compiled by James Madison University political science professor Martin Cohen, who with Karol is a co-author of The Party Decides: Presidential Nominations Before and After Reform.  In 2012, 10 of 29 Republican governors had endorsed Mitt Romney by the time he clinched the presidential nomination. This year, governors are not sending a clear signal to voters. Five have endorsed Rubio, a senator from Florida who has won one nominating contest so far. Two have endorsed John Kasich of Ohio, the only governor left in the race, who has won no contests. Two have Trump. One has backed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Three others endorsed candidates who have since dropped out of the race. The governors who have made endorsements so far have had little impact. Rubio lost in Tennessee, South Carolina and Arkansas, despite the backing of governors in those states. Kasich got only 4 percent of the vote in Alabama on Tuesday after that states Governor Robert Bentley endorsed him.  Iowa Governor Terry Branstad called on voters in his state to reject Cruz before the states February caucuses. Cruz won. So far, only Texas Governor Greg Abbott has picked a winner. He endorsed Cruz, who won Texas on Tuesday. Trump has put many governors in a difficult position. The real estate developer is expected to easily win Mississippis Republican primary next Tuesday, for example, but his support for Planned Parenthood and government-backed health insurance, among other policies, put him at odds with the conservative positions backed by Governor Phil Bryant. Bryant will support Trump should he end up being the partys nominee, but he has not decided whether to endorse a candidate before the primary, an aide told Reuters.  In theory, governors should be in a position to shape the outcome of this years nominating contests. Republicans at the state level have delivered tax cuts, abortion restrictions and other conservative victories from Maine to Arizona, while their counterparts in charge of Congress have been locked in a stalemate with Democratic President Barack Obama. But the plethora of establishment-minded candidates this year has made it more difficult for governors and other senior officials to decide who to back, let alone try to shape the outcome with an endorsement.  Republican governors in Maryland, Florida, Wyoming, Indiana, Wisconsin, North Dakota, South Dakota, Arizona, Nebraska and Michigan declined to say whether they would back Trump if he were the partys nominee.  Governors in Utah, Oklahoma, North Carolina and Georgia have yet to endorse a candidate but would back Trump if he won the nomination, aides said.     Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker told reporters this week he would not vote for Trump in November.

Florida mayors press presidential debate moderators for climate airtime,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mayors of 21 cities in Florida on Friday called on the moderators of next weeks presidential debates in Miami to ask candidates how they would deal with rising sea levels caused by climate change, a concern of the states coastal communities. It would beunconscionable for these issues of grave concern for the people of Florida to not be addressed in the upcoming debate you will be hosting in the state, the mayors wrote in an letter to CNN, The Washington Post, Univision and the other media outlets hosting the Democratic and Republican debates on March 9 and March 10 in Miami.  The bipartisan group of mayors, who represent coastal cities and towns from Miami to Tampa, have complained that the issue of climate change has not been raised in the dozens of televised debates held to date. Of the four remaining Republican candidates, none say they believe that anything should be done to address climate change and all have called for federal environmental rules to be scaled back. One of the letters signatories, Pinecrest Mayor Cindy Lerner, traveled to New Hampshire in February to press Florida Republican candidate Senator Marco Rubio to discuss the issue. Rubio has said that the climate has always been changing and that he will not support policies to combat climate change that will destroy our economy. Billionaire businessman Donald Trump has called climate change a conspiracy invented by China, while Texas Senator Ted Cruz called climate science pseudoscientific theory. Ohio Governor John Kasich has said climate change is a problem but has not proposed a plan to address it. Democratic hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders have made climate change a top-tier issue that needs to be addressed. Southeast Florida is especially vulnerable to rising sea levels. Four counties in the region formed the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact six years ago to coordinate their response and pool funding to deal with its impact. The issue has gotten little attention in the national presidential debates.   The mayors provided debate moderators three questions on climate change, all of which were directed to Rubio. They warned that higher sea levels will pose a costly threat to Floridas economy. Florida coastal communities could experience about a 2-foot (60-cm) rise in sea level by 2060, the U.S. Geological Survey said.

The top U.S. diplomat told a congressional hearing on Feb. 23 that he might be in Cuba for a dialogue on human rights before the presidents scheduled trip March 21-22. But officials said on Thursday that Kerrys visit had been canceled amid concerns over Cubas human rights record.

Fox News Republican debate draws biggest audience of 2016 contests,"(Reuters) - A raucous Republican Party debate on Thursday drew the biggest audience for a televised U.S. presidential match-up in 2016, according to early ratings data, but viewership was well below the record set last August. The Fox News Channel (FOXA.O) debate among Republican front-runner Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and John Kasich drew 16.9 million viewers, according to early Nielsen data provided by the network on Friday. That was higher than the last Republican Party debate, which aired on cable channel CNN and Telemundo on Feb. 25 and brought in a TV audience of 14.5 million. Republican debates have drawn much higher TV audiences in this U.S. presidential cycle than those involving Democrats.  The debate was the four remaining candidates first face-to-face encounter since Super Tuesday nominating contests this week gave extra momentum to Trump but did not knock out his rivals.[L2N16C03W] Fox News holds the record for the largest audience for a non-sports cable TV program. Some 24 million Americans tuned in when it hosted the first of the U.S. presidential debates in August 2015. Thursdays debate in Detroit was the second-highest rated telecast in network history, Fox said. At Thursdays debate, Trumps rivals assailed him for shifting positions on the issues but said in the end they would reluctantly support him if he were their partys nominee.

"Trump nomination odds wane in online betting, third party run bets up","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trumps prospects of winning the Republican nomination for the White House have slid sharply in online wagering venues, and bets that Republicans could have a fractured convention or that Trump may run as a third-party candidate were increasing. Chances of Trump claiming the Republican mantle have fallen hard to 69 percent after cresting at 86 percent this week following his winning seven of 11 states in Super Tuesday voting, according to PredictWise, which aggregates betting on multiple venues into an implied probability. The billionaire businessman is still the prohibitive favorite, but it was the steepest slide in his imputed chances since his second-place showing in the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1.  Trump faces withering attacks from rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and from 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, who labeled him a danger to the Republican party and the United States. On PredictIt, a site aggregated into PredictWise probability, Trumps chances were 70 percent early Friday, up slightly from late Thursday when they fell to 68 percent, their lowest since Feb. 23. PredictIt is operated by Victoria University in New Zealand.  Online wagering venues such as Irelands PaddyPower, which express candidates prospects as traditional sports-betting odds, show Trump losing luster as Rubio and Cruz gain steam. PaddyPowers odds show Trump as a 2-to-5 favorite compared with a 1-to-7 favorite right after Super Tuesday. Odds on Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida, narrowed to 4-to-1 from 5-to-1 on Tuesday, and odds for Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, were 9-to-1 from 12-to-1 earlier this week. Intense squabbling among Republican candidates and efforts by establishment Republicans to block a Trump nomination at this summers Republican National Convention boosted bets that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the favorite for the Democratic nomination, would win the Nov. 8 general election. Clintons prospects of winning a head-to-head contest against Trump shot to above 60 percent earlier this week and stood at 57 percent on Friday, according to PredictIt. Trumps chances of trouncing Clinton sank to 27 percent on Friday from  39 percent in late February.  Republican infighting is fueling betting that Republicans will have a so-called brokered convention, which occurs when no candidate wins a majority of delegates before the convention, or that Trump will run as a third-party candidate. Chances for a brokered convention closed at 40 percent on Thursday on record volume in betting on PredictIt after starting the week at 23 percent. They were 39 percent early on Friday. The last brokered U.S. major-party convention was in 1952 when Democrats nominated Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson on the third ballot. The last brokered Republican convention was in 1948, when New York Governor Thomas Dewey won in three ballots. Neither candidate won the presidential election. Chances that Trump would run as a third-party candidate have ticked higher, but it remains a long-shot in betting circles. PredictIt put the chances of him running as an independent at 17 percent on Friday, from 14 percent on Thursday and 10 percent a week ago.

You're fired! U.S. school debaters' dim view of Trump's podium style,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump has dismissed fellow White House hopefuls as liars, journalists as disgusting people and Mexican immigrants as rapists with a belligerent public speaking style that has helped catapult him to the front of the Republican pack. The verbal tactics, on display in Thursday nights debate in Detroit, have given the billionaire real estate developer front-runner status in early primary contests and opinion polls of U.S. Republican voters. But they would not last long on an academic debate stage, according to high school and college competitors and their coaches. He would last one tournament and then be removed from the team, said Eric Di Michele, coach of the speech and debate team at Regis High School in New York, one of the countrys top-ranked teams. This kind of ad hominem attack followed by insults, Ive never seen it. Ad hominem attacks, a Latin phrase meaning directed at a  person rather than an idea, have long been a staple of the U.S. campaign trail where candidates are selling themselves as much as their ideas to voters. Referring to his closest rivals to be the Republican presidential nominee in Novembers election, Trump has repeatedly called U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas a liar and dismissed Senator Marco Rubio of Florida as little Marco. His wins in the early nominating contests have prompted some of his rivals to take a similar approach. Cruz has labeled Trump profane and vulgar. Rubio has poked fun at Trumps tan, suggested he urinated in his pants and rolled out a sexual double entendre about the size of his hands. With a flourish, Trump kicked back at that on Thursday night, flashing his hands at the audience and asking, Look at those hands. Are they small hands? before dismissing any suggestion he might be small elsewhere. I guarantee you there is no problem. Di Michele called it a surreal moment. In 34 years of coaching debate, Ive never seen any debater reference the size of any part of his anatomy, he said. Asked in Thursdays debate about his own use of personal attacks, Rubio argued, For the last year, Donald Trump has basically mocked everybody ... If theres anyone whos ever deserved to be attacked that way its Donald Trump.  Of the remaining Republican candidates, Ohio Governor John Kasich has steered away from the personal, sticking doggedly to policy amid Thursday nights sometimes chaotic exchanges. Trumps language, admired by his supporters as frank, has drawn wide criticism for its crude insults. Republican 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney attacked Trumps style as well as his policies in a speech on Thursday, citing the bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd third-grade theatrics. In schools, the campaign antics have inspired academic debaters to become more civilized. That sort of coarse language has made people more critical of the political parties, said Charlie Barton, a 17-year-old Regis senior debater. What weve seen is a greater shift away from that sort of rhetoric. NO LINCOLN-DOUGLAS HERE Academic debating, also known as forensics, has a long history in the United States and takes much of its form and inspiration from politics. Indeed, one style of debating is named after the storied 1858 debates between Abraham Lincoln and U.S. Senator Stephen Douglas of Illinois, which put the future president on the national stage. But the judging in academic debating is relentlessly focused on facts; students study examples and background before making their cases. The discipline can bear as much resemblance to current televised presidential debates as Greco-Roman wrestling does to chair-throwing WWE spectacles. They are less like politicians and more like lawyers, because they are not necessarily going for a vote on personality, they are arguing that their case is correct, said Derek Yuill, the speech and debate coach at Gabrielino High School in San Gabriel, California, a top-ranked U.S. forensics team. Some young debaters have watched the Republican matchups more as an example of what not to do. I really wish I could take on Donald Trump in some kind of debate round, because he especially among the candidates would not fare well in academic debate, said Jacqueline Dang, a 17-year-old senior at Gabrielino. He doesnt seem to have any kind of evidence or numbers to substantiate his claims, other than his poll numbers. College debaters have also been watching Trumps performance with bemusement, said Connie Lee, 18, the president of Dartmouth Colleges Parliamentary Debate Team. The name-calling and the ad hominem attacks get made fun of at debate-watching parties, Lee said. She said that while many collegiate debaters are politically liberal, they still respect skilled oratory from conservatives when they see it. Cruz, who holds a spot on Princeton Universitys debate hall of fame, is admired for his abilities. There are jokes about ambitious debaters being the next Ted Cruz, Lee said. A Trump spokeswoman said the campaign had no doubts about his debating ability. According to all the online polls, Mr. Trump has performed exceptionally well and won all the debates, spokeswoman Hope Hicks said by e-mail. Despite giving poor marks for Trumps debate performances, Gabrielinos Yuill said he does tell his students to note how well Trump gets into the spotlight to convey his message: Thats what I tell them, how important it is to get their attention.

Texas governor takes aim at 'caustic' tweeter who won county GOP race," (Advisory: This story contains content that may offend some readers) By Jon Herskovitz AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Thursday distanced the party from its newly elected leader in Travis County, a self-described caustic tweeter and author of political conspiracy books who says he uses sexually explicit language on social media to educate people. Robert Morrow, 51, beat the current Republican Party chairman in the county in Tuesdays primary, causing some officials in the party to tell local media they are seeing if they can prevent him from taking office. Robert Morrow in no way speaks for the Republican Party or its values. He cannot adequately represent the Travis County GOP, said John Wittman, a spokesman for the Texas governor. Morrow said on his Twitter feed shortly after his win, I am the face of the Re-Pube-Licking Party, and posted an idea for a pornographic video involving former first lady Barbara Bush. I put out caustic and inflammatory tweets because I am trying to educate people, he said in a Reuters interview, adding he provides Internet links to support his arguments. Morrow boasted he did not spend a penny on his campaign and probably won because his name appeared first on the ballot. Travis County, which contains the Texas capital Austin, is one of the few Democratic strongholds in a heavily Republican state. But party officials may be over a barrel in that there is little they can do to remove someone who has been duly elected. Some party leaders have floated the idea of starting a new county organization for the Republican Party and leaving Morrow to preside over an empty operation. They are neutered gerbils, Morrow said. The people have spoken and Morrow is the face of the Travis County Republican Party. Morrow, a Ted Cruz supporter who has also written conspiracy theory books about the Clintons and the John F. Kennedy assassination, has made defamatory remarks about Republican leaders in the state and the current crop of presidential candidates.  The reason I ran for chair of the Travis County Republican Party is because I was so disgusted with the involvement of the Bush crime family in national politics and Republican Party politics, he said. Andy Hogue, the communications director for the Travis County Republican Party, said the new county chairman does not take office until June 13. At this time there are many personal opinions but no official courses of action or statements, Hogue said.

"Republicans in tailspin, group forms to draft Ryan for U.S. president","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With U.S. Republicans sharply split over a front-runner they cannot unite behind, a new group is trying to push the countrys top elected Republican, Paul Ryan, into the White House race. The Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan filed papers as a Super PAC with the Federal Election Commission on Thursday, adding to the groups of mainstream Republican leaders and donors with a shared goal: stopping Trump. Ryan, the House of Representatives speaker who spoke out against Trump for not quickly rejecting white supremacist support, did not appear ready to take on the role. He is flattered, but not interested, Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said in an email on Friday. Politico first reported the formation of the draft-Ryan PAC. Mitt Romney, the Republicans losing presidential candidate in 2012, also said he was not interested. There are no circumstances I can foresee where that would possibly happen, Romney said on NBCs Today show on Friday, a day after he excoriated Trump as a fraud ill-equipped for the White House. The Republican Party may need more than a hero as it grapples with its deepest divisions in decades.  Those splits were on display again on Thursday night as Trump took on his two closest challengers, U.S. Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz of Texas, in a debate marked by the yelling, name-calling and vulgarity that has tainted the 2016 Republican race. Trumps rivals said they would support the ultimate nominee but it was clear on Friday that would be easier said than done. That is the quandary Im trying to avoid the Republican Party having to face, Rubio said on CNN on Friday.  While the anti-Trump movements proliferated, some Republicans have urged party leaders to respect the will of the voters.  Trump spokesman Sam Clovis seized on that message on Friday, warning on CNN that it was dangerous for Republican leaders to call American voters stupid because they support Trump. You have record turnout in every state so far. Record turnout. That doesnt happen by accident, said Clovis, national campaign co-chairman. Trump is tapping into what is going on in this country like no one else has in a long, long time. I havent seen anything like this since Ronald Reagan. Columnist Peggy Noonan, a former Reagan speechwriter, had a different lament in the Wall Street Journal on Friday. I think we are seeing a great political party shatter before our eyes, she said.

India denies visas to U.S. religious freedom body,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - India has denied visas for a delegation from the U.S. government agency charged with monitoring international religious freedom, the agency said on Thursday. The delegation from the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom had been scheduled to leave for India on Friday for a long-planned visit with the support of the U.S. State Department and the U.S. embassy in New Delhi, but India had failed to issue the necessary visas, the commission said. We are deeply disappointed by the Indian governments denial, in effect, of these visas, USCIRF chairman Robert  George said in a statement. As a pluralistic, non-sectarian, and democratic state, and a close partner of the United States, India should have the confidence to allow our visit, he said. George said USCIRF had been able to travel to many countries, including those among the worst offenders of religious freedom, including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, China, and Myanmar. One would expect that the Indian government would allow for more transparency than have these nations, and would welcome the opportunity to convey its views directly to USCIRF. The Indian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last year, despite a much-heralded fresh start in U.S.-India ties under Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the United States ran into problems arranging visits by the head of its office to combat human trafficking and its special envoy for gay rights. A U.S. State Department official referred queries on the visa issue to the Indian government, but highlighted remarks by President Barack Obama on a visit to Delhi last year, in which he made a plea for freedom of religion in a country with a history of strife between Hindus and minorities. In its 2015 report, the bipartisan USCIRF said incidents of religiously motivated and communal violence had reportedly increased for three consecutive years. It said that despite its status as a pluralistic, secular democracy, India had long struggled to protect minority religious communities or provide justice when crimes occur, creating a climate of impunity.  Non-governmental organizations and religious leaders, including from the Muslim, Christian, and Sikh communities, attributed the initial increase in violence to religiously divisive campaigning in advance of the countrys 2014 general election won by Modi.  The report said that since the election, religious minorities had been subject to derogatory comments by politicians linked to Modis Bharatiya Janata Party and numerous violent attacks and forced conversions by Hindu nationalist groups. U.S. law allows for imposition of sanctions on countries the commission terms of particular concern, but the USCIRFs recommendations are not binding and these are not automatically imposed.

Clinton ex-employee tells FBI no sign email server was hacked: NYT,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The technician who helped manage Hillary Clintons private email server for her work as secretary of state has given security logs to investigators that he said show no signs of foreign hacking, the New York Times reported on Thursday. Bryan Pagliano is cooperating with the Federal Bureau of Investigations criminal inquiry into the email setup in exchange for limited immunity by the U.S. Department of Justice, according to the Times, citing unnamed people who know about the investigation. With limited immunity, his testimony cannot be used in a prosecution against him, the Times said. The investigation has overshadowed Hillary Clintons campaign to become the Democratic Partys candidate in the November presidential election. Clinton has apologized for the arrangement but says she did nothing wrong and that she believes the government will vindicate her. Pagliano, who helped set up and run the email system in Clintons New York home, told investigators that the logs he handed over indicated that no intrusion occurred, the Times said. The security logs show who accessed the server and when, though they may not capture more sophisticated hacking, the Times said. Pagliano was still working at the State Departments Bureau of Information Resource Management as recently as last September, but has since left, a department spokesman said on Monday. The spokesman declined to say when he left or why. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is doing its own analysis of whether the server was attacked, according to media reports. FBI agents plan to seek interviews with Clintons aides in coming weeks and would like to interview Clinton herself as their investigation enters a new phase, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing two people familiar with the inquiry. The interviews would look into how the server was set up and used and what precautions were taken to protect sensitive data, according to the people, who described the matter on condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing, Bloomberg News said. Investigators were almost finished examining computers and other physical evidence as part of the inquiry, which is focused on whether Clintons use of private email while serving as the nations top diplomat led to the improper handling of classified information, according to the people. Pagliano previously worked on Clintons failed 2008 presidential campaign, and ended up joining her at the State Department in 2009 as a political appointee, working as a technology specialist and maintaining Clintons email server. His employment ended with Clinton in February 2013, but he stayed on as a contractor. More than 2,000 of Clintons emails contain classified information that could harm national security if leaked, according to the State Department. The government forbids sending or storing such information outside secure, government-controlled channels, and has prosecuted people for breaches. The FBI and the Justice Department have declined to comment on their investigation, including who might be its target, beyond confirming its existence. Paglianos lawyer did not respond to requests for comment. A Clinton spokesman said the campaign is pleased that Pagliano is cooperating, but declined to respond to questions.

"Republican Romney calls Trump 'a fraud,' creates pathway to contested convention","DETROIT (Reuters) - Former U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney attacked 2016 Republican front-runner Donald Trump as a fraud on Thursday and urged primary voters to keep the outspoken New York billionaire from getting the nomination, paving the way for possible horse trading at a party convention in July. In an unusually harsh speech, party elder Romney warned that former reality TV star Trump would likely lose to possible Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election if he becomes the Republican nominee. Trumps rise has split the Republican Party between mainstream figures like Romney, and Trump supporters who complain the party does not reflect their concerns about illegal immigration, the slow economic recovery and what they see as Americas diminishing role in the world. That split widened when Romney, the party nominee in 2012,  urged Republican primary voters to vote tactically in different states to back Trumps opponents and block his path to the nomination. Heres what I know. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud, said Romney, 68, who did not endorse any candidate.  I would vote for Marco Rubio in Florida, for John Kasich in Ohio, and for Ted Cruz or whichever one of the other two contenders has the best chance of beating Mr. Trump in a given state, he said. Rubio is a U.S. senator from Florida and Kasich is the Ohio governor. By calling for targeted voting, Romney was setting up the possibility of a contested convention when Republicans gather in Cleveland in mid-July to select their nominee for the November election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. That could create a pathway to deny Trump the 1,237 delegates needed for nomination. The last Republican convention to go beyond one ballot was  in 1948 when Thomas Dewey was nominated. I think the governor is just being realistic about where things stand and advocating a potential strategy that could stop the Trump nomination, said former Romney spokesman Ryan Williams. Republican strategist Scott Reed said he doubted the last-ditch tactical voting suggestion would work. No one will be playing the targeted voting game. Theres too much anger and distrust, Reed said. Trump, 69, has made his partys establishment uneasy with his abrasive tone and policy positions, including plans to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, deport 11 million illegal immigrants and temporarily bar Muslims from entering the country. More than 90 Republican national security leaders have signed a scathing open letter opposing Trump and his stance on many foreign policy issues.     Romneys speech in Utah was the spearhead of a mainstream Republican attempt to rein in Trump after he won most states in this weeks Republican Super Tuesday nominating contests and took a step toward earning the nomination.  The address came hours before Trump and his rivals shared a stage in Detroit at 9 p.m. EST for a debate hosted by Fox News.  Trump leads many polls for primaries in the remaining states, including in major ones like Florida on March 15, dampening prospects of derailing him. The party establishments strategy risks backfiring by further energizing Trumps supporters, many of them white, blue-collar voters. If only Romney talked like this four years ago about Obama ... or Trump, conservative political commentator Michelle Malkin said on Twitter. Too freaking late and too freaking lame. Trump dismissed the former Massachusetts governor who lost to Obama four years ago. Mitt is a failed candidate. He failed. He failed horribly. He failed badly, Trump told a rally in Maine.        Romney decided on his own to give the speech, which he wrote himself. Romney said Trumps economic policy would sink America into prolonged recession, mocked Trumps ego, and called him a con man. A business genius he is not, Romney said. David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Obama, called the Romney speech a break glass moment he had not seen since 1964, when Republicans abandoned their candidate Barry Goldwater. Axelrod noted thousands of Republicans had already voted for Trump in primary elections. I wonder about tactic of calling them fools, Axelrod wrote on Twitter.

Kerry trip to Cuba for rights dialogue canceled: U.S. officials,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tentative plans for U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to visit Cuba before mid-March for a human rights dialogue have been canceled, two U.S. officials said on Thursday, amid concerns over the Cuban governments human rights record. Kerry told a congressional hearing on Feb. 23 that he might be in Cuba in the next week or two to hold a dialogue on human rights, ahead of President Barack Obamas scheduled trip to the island on March 21-22. The sources said the trip had been canceled because U.S. and Cuban officials were deep in negotiations on issues including which dissidents Obama might see in Havana and that a trip in the timeframe Kerry had mentioned was not seen as constructive. State Department spokesman John Kirby said he had no updates regarding Kerrys potential travel to Cuba. The Secretary is still interested in visiting in the near future, and we are working with our Cuban counterparts and our embassy to determine the best timeframe, Kirby said in an emailed statement. U.S. critics of Obamas opening to Cuba have complained that the president has received little in return for restoring diplomatic relations with the former Cold War foe. On Feb. 24, the Cuban government granted seven dissidents who were out of prison on parole a one-time permission to travel outside the country in an apparent gesture to the United States ahead of Obamas historic visit.

Exclusive: Koch brothers will not use funds to try to block Trump nomination,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Koch brothers, the most powerful conservative mega donors in the United States, will not use their $400 million political arsenal to try to block Republican front-runner Donald Trumps path to the presidential nomination, a spokesman told Reuters on Wednesday. The decision by the billionaire industrialists is another setback to Republican establishment efforts to derail the New York real estate moguls bid for the White House, and follows speculation the Kochs would soon launch a Trump Intervention. We have no plans to get involved in the primary, said James Davis, spokesman for Freedom Partners, the Koch brothers political umbrella group. He would not elaborate on what the brothers strategy would be for the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. Three sources close to the Kochs said the brothers made the decision because they were concerned that spending millions of dollars attacking Trump would be money wasted, since they had not yet seen any attack on Trump stick.  The Koch brothers are also smarting from the millions of dollars they pumped into the failed 2012 Republican presidential bids of Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney, the sources said.  Donors and media reports have speculated since January, when the Kochs gathered 500 of Americas wealthiest political donors at a California resort, that they would deploy their vast political network to target Trump. The Kochs oppose his protectionist trade rhetoric and hardline views on immigration - which include building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and deporting millions of illegal immigrants. Many Republican figures and business backers are eager to see Trump, a political outsider who has tapped into rising anti-establishment sentiment, fail in his bid for the nomination. They prefer instead a more traditional candidate like U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. But with Trump racking up a series of wins in the early nominating contests against opponents including Rubio and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, there is a growing sense of inevitability that he will win the partys mantle.

Republican foreign policy veterans rebuke Trump worldview,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than 90 Republican foreign policy veterans have pledged to oppose Donald Trump, saying his proposals would undermine U.S. security, in the latest sign of fissures between the Republican presidential front-runner and the party establishment. Mr. Trumps own statements lead us to conclude that as president, he would use the authority of his office to act in ways that make America less safe, and which would diminish our standing in the world, the signatories wrote in a open letter on Wednesday. Furthermore, his expansive view of how presidential power should be wielded against his detractors poses a distinct threat to civil liberty in the United States, said the letter, which was posted on a blog called War on the Rocks. The signatories include Robert Zoellick, a former World Bank president and deputy secretary of state; former U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff; and Dov Zakheim, a top Pentagon official under President George W. Bush. They represent both centrist Republican foreign policy circles and neoconservatives who favor a robust U.S. international role and wielded clout during Bushs 2001-2009 presidency. Billionaire businessman Trump won the largest number of states in this weeks Super Tuesday nominating contests, intensifying moves by the partys establishment wing to derail his path to the nomination. On Thursday, Trump in an interview with ABC News flatly rejected the criticism in the letter and blasted the nations military leaders as ineffective. Bryan McGrath, a retired U.S. Navy officer and adviser to Republican Mitt Romneys unsuccessful 2012 presidential campaign who helped organize the letter, said at least two people declined to sign because of concerns it would fuel Trumps campaign theme of being an anti-Washington candidate opposed by the establishment. This is really drawing a bright moral line and saying that if were going to keep our souls, we cant cross it, said    Eliot Cohen, who served as counselor to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and helped spearhead the letter. Rice was asked to sign but chose not to, in keeping with her general practice of not signing on to such group letters, a spokeswoman for the Stanford University professor said. The list of signatures, which numbered 60 when the letter was released on Wednesday night, had grown to 94 by Thursday afternoon. The signatories did not include other several high-profile former officials such as Bush national security adviser Stephen Hadley or former Secretary of State Colin Powell. It was unknown if they were invited to sign. The letter rejects numerous Trump foreign policy statements, including his hateful, anti-Muslim rhetoric, his demand that Mexico fund a wall to control illegal immigration across the U.S. border, and his insistence that Japan pay much more for U.S. security assistance. As committed and loyal Republicans, we are unable to support a Party ticket with Mr. Trump at its head, the signatories said. We commit ourselves to working energetically to prevent the election of someone so utterly unfitted to the office. The War on the Rocks blog calls itself a platform for former diplomats, military and intelligence officers and scholars to comment through a realist lens on global affairs.  Trump has alarmed some mainstream Republicans with vows to shred international trade deals. Many fear a Trump presidency would severely strain ties with allies and are concerned about his stated willingness to work more closely with authoritarian Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also has criticized the Republican Party for its backing of Bushs 2003 Iraq invasion and has said he supports the practice of waterboarding and other similar interrogation techniques. Max Boot, a foreign policy adviser to Romneys 2012 campaign and supporter of the Iraq invasion, was among the letters signers and said he would sooner work for (North Korean dictator) Kim Jong Un than for Donald Trump. I think Donald Trump is objectively more dangerous than Kim Jong Un and not as stable. Kurt Volker, a permanent representative to NATO under Bush, said he did not sign the letter because of concerns that any letter from national security intelligentsia could backfire. He would actually use it as a bragging right, said Volker, adding he had no intention of working for Trump but wanted to be free to offer advice to any future president, and that such a letter could prompt Trump to hold a grudge. Several others who declined to sign and asked not to be identified, said they feared it could help Democrat Hillary Clinton win the presidency. Trump told MSNBC on Thursday that he would name his foreign policy and national security advisers in a week or two. ... But ultimately its my thought more than anybody elses. Those Trump has spoken with on foreign policy include a retired U.S. general and intelligence official, Michael Flynn, who favors closer ties with Russia. Flynn has declined to comment on whether he is advising Trump. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who won popularity for his response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, has said he has been having regular talks with Trump but not in a formal role.

"House Speaker Ryan warns of 'rhetoric,' not of Trump ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan vowed on Thursday to speak out against Republican presidential campaign rhetoric that could mislead voters about the party and its conservative principles, but stopped short of criticizing front-runner Donald Trump directly. On a day when his former presidential running mate Mitt Romney denounced Trump, Ryan said he laughed out loud this week when Trump warned that the speaker could pay a big price for not getting along with him if he becomes the party nominee. Heres what I can control. If I see episodes where conservatism is being disfigured, if I see comments that mislead the people as to who we are as Republicans, Im going to speak out on those, said Ryan. The speaker has already admonished Trump for failing to disavow support from Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. Im going to speak out for who I am and what I believe and what we as House Republicans believe, and what conservatism is as we understand it, he told reporters.  Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, delivered a blistering rebuke of Trump on Thursday, saying the real estate developer and former reality television star was a phony, a fraud.Ryan, who was Romneys vice presidential running mate in their failed attempt to unseat President Barack Obama, said he did not know the content of the speech in advance.  Mitt Romney is one of our party leaders. He cares deeply about the future of the Republican Party and the country, he said. These are the kinds of things that happen in a competitive Republican primary. Ryan said his role as House speaker and chairman of the Republican presidential nominating committee would be to provide a bold Republican policy platform capable of offering voters substance on important issues including jobs and the economy.    He said he would reach out to each Republican presidential candidate to talk about the agenda. But Ryan said he does not know Trump. Were going to obviously get to know each other if he gets the nomination. And well cross those bridges when we get to it, the speaker said. Im a good-natured guy, so I get along with everybody.

I share the concerns about Donald Trump that my friend and former Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, described in his speech today, McCain said in a statement. I would also echo the many concerns about Mr. Trumps uninformed and indeed dangerous statements on national security issues that have been raised by 65 Republican defense and foreign policy leaders, he said of the letter, published online.

Text: Mitt Romney speech slamming Donald Trump,"(Reuters) - The following is the full text of the speech delivered on Thursday by former Massachusetts Governor and 2012 Republican nominee for U.S. president Mitt Romney to the Institute of Politics at the University of Utah. I am not here to announce my candidacy for office. I am not going to endorse a candidate today. Instead, I would like to offer my perspective on the nominating process of my party. In 1964, days before the presidential election which, incidentally, we lost, Ronald Reagan went on national television and challenged America saying that it was a Time for Choosing. He saw two paths for America, one that embraced conservative principles dedicated to lifting people out of poverty and helping create opportunity for all, and the other, an oppressive government that would lead America down a darker, less free path. Im no Ronald Reagan and this is a different moment but I believe with all my heart and soul that we face another time for choosing, one that will have profound consequences for the Republican Party and more importantly, for the country. I say this in part because of my conviction that America is poised to lead the world for another century. Our technology engines, our innovation dynamic, and the ambition and skill of our people will propel our economy and raise our standard of living. America will remain as it is today, the envy of the world. Warren Buffett was 100% right when he said last week that the babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history. That doesnt mean we dont have real problems and serious challenges. At home, poverty persists and wages are stagnant. The horrific massacres of Paris and San Bernardino, the nuclear ambitions of the Iranian mullahs, the aggressions of Putin, the growing assertiveness of China and the nuclear tests of North Korea confirm that we live in troubled and dangerous times. But if we make the right choices, Americas future will be even better than our past and better than our present. On the other hand, if we make improvident choices, the bright horizon I foresee will never materialize. Let me put it plainly, if we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished. Let me explain why. First, the economy: If Donald Trumps plans were ever implemented, the country would sink into a prolonged recession. A few examples: His proposed 35% tariff-like penalties would instigate a trade war that would raise prices for consumers, kill export jobs, and lead entrepreneurs and businesses to flee America. His tax plan, in combination with his refusal to reform entitlements and to honestly address spending would balloon the deficit and the national debt. So even as Donald Trump has offered very few specific economic plans, what little he has said is enough to know that he would be very bad for American workers and for American families. But wait, you say, isnt he a huge business success that knows what hes talking about? No he isnt. His bankruptcies have crushed small businesses and the men and women who worked for them. He inherited his business, he didnt create it. And what ever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then theres Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks, and Trump Mortgage? A business genius he is not. Now not every policy Donald Trump has floated is bad. He wants to repeal and replace Obamacare. He wants to bring jobs home from China and Japan. But his prescriptions to do these things are flimsy at best. At the last debate, all he could remember about his healthcare plan was to remove insurance boundaries between states. Successfully bringing jobs home requires serious policy and reforms that make America the place businesses want to plant and grow. You cant punish business into doing the things you want. Frankly, the only serious policy proposals that deal with the broad range of national challenges we confront, come today from Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and John Kasich. One of these men should be our nominee.  I know that some people want the race to be over. They look at history and say a trend like Mr. Trumps isnt going to be stopped. Perhaps. But the rules of political history have pretty much all been shredded during this campaign. If the other candidates can find common ground, I believe we can nominate a person who can win the general election and who will represent the values and policies of conservatism. Given the current delegate selection process, this means that I would vote for Marco Rubio in Florida, for John Kasich in Ohio, and for Ted Cruz or whichever one of the other two contenders has the best chance of beating Mr. Trump in a given state. Let me turn to national security and the safety of our homes and loved ones. Trumps bombast is already alarming our allies and fueling the enmity of our enemies. Insulting all Muslims will keep many of them from fully engaging with us in the urgent fight against ISIS. And for what purpose? Muslim terrorists would only have to lie about their religion to enter the country. What he said on 60 Minutes about Syria and ISIS has to go down as the most ridiculous and dangerous idea of the campaign season: Let ISIS take out Assad, he said, and then we can pick up the remnants. Think about that: Let the most dangerous terror organization the world has ever known take over a country? This is recklessness in the extreme. Donald Trump tells us that he is very, very smart. Im afraid that when it comes to foreign policy he is very, very not smart. I am far from the first to conclude that Donald Trump lacks the temperament of be president. After all, this is an individual who mocked a disabled reporter, who attributed a reporters questions to her menstrual cycle, who mocked a brilliant rival who happened to be a woman due to her appearance, who bragged about his marital affairs, and who laces his public speeches with vulgarity. Donald Trump says he admires Vladimir Putin, while has called George W. Bush a liar. That is a twisted example of evil trumping good. There is dark irony in his boasts of his sexual exploits during the Vietnam War while John McCain, whom he has mocked, was imprisoned and tortured. Dishonesty is Trumps hallmark: He claimed that he had spoken clearly and boldly against going into Iraq. Wrong, he spoke in favor of invading Iraq. He said he saw thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating 9/11. Wrong, he saw no such thing. He imagined it. His is not the temperament of a stable, thoughtful leader. His imagination must not be married to real power. The President of the United States has long been the leader of the free world. The president and yes the nominees of the countrys great parties help define America to billions of people. All of them bear the responsibility of being an example for our children and grandchildren. Think of Donald Trumps personal qualities, the bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd third grade theatrics. We have long referred to him as The Donald. He is the only person in America to whom we have added an article before his name. It wasnt because he had attributes we admired. Now imagine your children and your grandchildren acting the way he does. Will you welcome that? Havent we seen before what happens when people in prominent positions fail the basic responsibility of honorable conduct? We have, and it always injures our families and our country. Watch how he responds to my speech today. Will he talk about our policy differences or will he attack me with every imaginable low road insult? This may tell you what you need to know about his temperament, his stability, and his suitability to be president. Trump relishes any poll that reflects what he thinks of himself. But polls are also saying that he will lose to Hillary Clinton.  On Hillary Clintons watch at the State Department, Americas interests were diminished in every corner of the world. She compromised our national secrets, dissembled to the families of the slain, and jettisoned her most profound beliefs to gain presidential power.  For the last three decades, the Clintons have lived at the intersection of money and politics, trading their political influence to enrich their personal finances. They embody the term crony capitalism. It disgusts the American people and causes them to lose faith in our political process. A person so untrustworthy and dishonest as Hillary Clinton must not become president. But a Trump nomination enables her victory. The audio and video of the infamous Tapper-Trump exchange on the Ku Klux Klan will play a hundred thousand times on cable and who knows how many million times on social media. There are a number of people who claim that Mr. Trump is a con man, a fake. There is indeed evidence of that. Mr. Trump has changed his positions not just over the years, but over the course of the campaign, and on the Ku Klux Klan, daily for three days in a row. We will only really know if he is the real deal or a phony if he releases his tax returns and the tape of his interview with the New York Times. I predict that there are more bombshells in his tax returns. I predict that he doesnt give much if anything to the disabled and to our veterans. I predict that he told the New York Times that his immigration talk is just that: talk. And I predict that despite his promise to do so, first made over a year ago, he will never ever release his tax returns. Never. Not the returns under audit, not even the returns that are no longer being audited. He has too much to hide. Nor will he authorize the Times to release the tapes. If Im right, you will have all the proof you need to know that Donald Trump is a phony. Attacking me as he surely will wont prove him any less of a phony. Its entirely in his hands to prove me wrong. All he has to do is to release his back taxes like he promised he would, and let us hear what he said behind closed doors to the New York Times. Ronald Reagan used to quote a Scottish philosopher who predicted that democracies and civilizations couldnt last more than about 200 years. John Adams wrote this: Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. I believe that America has proven these dire predictions wrong for two reasons. First, we have been blessed with great presidents, with giants among us. Men of character, integrity and selflessness have led our nation from its very beginning. None were perfect: each surely made mistakes. But in every case, they acted out of the desire to do what was right for America and for freedom. The second reason is because we are blessed with a great people, people who at every critical moment of choosing have put the interests of the country above their own.  These two things are related: our presidents time and again have called on us to rise to the occasion. John F. Kennedy asked us to consider what we could do for our country. Lincoln drew upon the better angels of our nature to save the union.  I understand the anger Americans feel today. In the past, our presidents have channeled that anger, and forged it into resolve, into endurance and high purpose, and into the will to defeat the enemies of freedom. Our anger was transformed into energy directed for good.  Mr. Trump is directing our anger for less than noble purposes. He creates scapegoats of Muslims and Mexican immigrants, he calls for the use of torture and for killing the innocent children and family members of terrorists. He cheers assaults on protesters. He applauds the prospect of twisting the Constitution to limit first amendment freedom of the press. This is the very brand of anger that has led other nations into the abyss. Heres what I know. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. Hes playing the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House and all we get is a lousy hat. His domestic policies would lead to recession. His foreign policies would make America and the world less safe. He has neither the temperament nor the judgment to be president. And his personal qualities would mean that America would cease to be a shining city on a hill.  America has greatness ahead. This is a time for choosing. God bless us to choose a nominee who will make that vision a reality.  ",politicsNews,"March 3, 2016 ",1
"White House to tap law professor, former Hill staffer to serve on CFTC","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Thursday said he plans to tap a law professor and a former congressional staffer to serve on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the agency that polices the derivatives marketplace. The White House said it plans to nominate Chris Brummer, a law professor at Georgetown University and Brian Quintenz, an investment firm founder who previously worked for former Ohio Republican Congresswoman Deborah Pryce. If Brummer and Quintenz are eventually confirmed by the U.S. Senate, it will finally allow the CFTC to fill its two vacant seats on the five-member panel. Democratic CFTC Commissioner Mark Wetjen left the agency in August 2015, while Republican CFTC Commissioner Scott OMalia resigned in July 2014. The CFTC won broad new powers to police the over-the-counter derivatives market in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.  The agency has largely completed writing the new regulations, and in the coming years much of the focus is expected to shift toward enforcing the rules. Debate over how the new derivatives rules will impact farmers and companies that use swaps to hedge their risks, however, has still remained a hot topic. Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts, whose panel will eventually vote on the two CFTC nominees, said Thursday he wants to make sure that both Brummer and Quintenz are sensitive to these so-called end-users who rely on derivatives to hedge against price fluctuations that impact their businesses. For the CFTC to effectively function for all stakeholders, we must make sure nominees have a solid understanding of agriculture and prioritize the folks who use the futures and derivatives markets to manage risk, he said in a statement. Brummer has previously worked in a variety of different roles, including some in the regulatory arena. In 2015, he completed a three-year stint serving on the Financial Industry Regulatory Authoritys National Adjudicatory Council, a body that reviews disciplinary proceedings of brokers and brokerage firms. He also served as an academic fellow in the international affairs office of the Securities and Exchange Commission and has taught at a variety of universities. Quintenz, meanwhile, has worked as an analyst and senior associate with Hill-Townsend Capital LLC. He also served as the director of travel and as assistant to the treasurer for the presidential exploratory committee of former Congressman John Kasich. ",politicsNews,"March 4, 2016 ",1
"Trump, anti-Trump forces start Florida ad battle","(Reuters) - Donald Trumps presidential campaign is buying commercial time on a TV station in West Palm Beach, Florida, taking on opponents in a paid media battle that the Republican front-runner has largely avoided so far. The March 15 nominating contest in Florida, a winner-take-all vote, is seen as one of the last chances to slow Trumps momentum after a string of victories on Super Tuesday. One SuperPAC allied with rival presidential candidate Marco Rubio has already shelled out millions in the state.  The race has become a fight between Trump and anti-Trump interests, which should drive new demand for ads, said Mark Egan, chief client officer of Maxus Americas, a media agency owned by GroupM. The big war really starts now, he said.The billionaire candidate to date has relied heavily on free air time and Twitter, largely ignoring television. On Thursday he began purchasing commercial slots for the first time on West Palm Beach station WPTV, said Lloyd Bucher, vice president and general manager of the station, an NBC affiliate. He declined to discuss the amount.  SuperPACs that oppose Trump are gearing up in the state. Conservative Solutions, a SuperPAC allied with Rubio, has aired or distributed $4.8 million worth of ads and direct mail in Florida that explicitly opposes Trump, according to Federal Election Commission data from Friday through Tuesday. That is the most spent by a candidate-allied SuperPAC against Trump in a single state so far. TV stations in states with upcoming primaries are fielding more inquiries from outside groups opposing Trump, said Steve Lanzano, president and CEO of TVB, a trade body for television broadcasters.  You are seeing a lot more SuperPACs coming out of the woodwork, he said. Election years typically provide windfalls for local TV stations as candidates blanket airwaves. Ad spending in the weeks leading up to the South Carolina primary was four times the level of 2012, Lanzano said.  Some media investors and analysts are concerned Trump may continue to rely mostly on free media exposure, which would hurt the revenues expected for local stations. Lanzano believes the Trump campaign will start buying more time to fight back against the attacks coming his way. I think he is going to spend a lot of money on advertising ultimately, Lanzano said. He is going to get bombarded.

New York judge weighs Cruz ballot challenge on birthplace issue,"ALBANY, New York (Reuters) - A New York judge on Thursday withheld judgment until Monday morning on a challenge from two New York residents seeking to remove Senator Ted Cruz from the states primary ballot for the presidential primary because of his birth in Canada. The plaintiffs objected to Cruzs inclusion in the ballot for the states April 19 primary election for the Republican partys presidential nomination, claiming the senator from Texas is constitutionally ineligible to assume the White House. New York Supreme Court Judge David Weinstein promised to decide if the case will proceed by Monday. He said the objectors, Barry Korman, 81, of Manhattan, and William Gallo, 85, of Manhasset, Long Island, could argue the merits later next week if he decides they have standing. Republican front-runner Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned Cruzs eligibility for the White House, and residents in Alabama, Pennsylvania and Texas have filed legal challenges to block him from appearing on the ballot.  An Illinois judge dismissed a similar challenge there this week on a technicality. Some legal experts say it is unlikely any judge in the U.S. will block Cruzs presidential run. In their Feb. 19 petition, the two New York residents attached a birth certificate for Cruz, showing he was born in December 1970 in Calgary, Alberta, in Canada, and arguing he was not naturally born in the United States as the Constitution dictates for any U.S. president. Cruz has said he is eligible to run because of his mothers U.S. citizenship. His father is a Cuban immigrant. Lawyer Grant Lally, appearing for Cruz in Albany, said the judge should dismiss the case because the objectors missed a deadline to file their petition, and added the matter is a federal, not a state, issue. Roger J. Bernstein, a lawyer for the objectors, said the challenge needed a judges attention. The voters of the Republican Party need clarity, he said.

Protesters in Kentucky claim they were assaulted at Trump rally,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - Protesters at a Donald Trump rally in Kentucky last Tuesday have filed complaints with police claiming they were assaulted by Trump supporters, according to police and protesters. Henry Brousseau, 17, of Louisville, said he went to the Super Tuesday event at the Kentucky International Convention Center in Louisville to protest Trumps campaign and was punched in the stomach by a woman who was wearing a T-shirt of the Traditionalist Worker Party. Were going to see how the police can find out who she is and hopefully well move on from there, he said in a telephone interview. Another protester, Molly Shah, 36, also of Louisville, said that she, too, had filed a complaint. Alicia Smiley, spokeswoman for the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department, said three complaints were filed on Wednesday and Thursday and were under review. These would mark the latest clashes between Trump supporters, security, and protesters. The day before Trump visited Louisville, black students were removed from a rally in Georgia. A website for the Traditionalist Worker Party describes it as a grassroots political organization that believes, among other things, that European-American identity is under constant attack.   The Southern Poverty Law Center, a non-profit civil rights and public interest advocacy organization that monitors groups it considers extremist, classifies the Traditionalist Worker Party as a white nationalist hate group, said Ryan Lentz, a writer and researcher for the center. Brousseau, who is white and transgender, said he joined people from Black Lives Matter, Parents for Social Justice, Showing Up for Racial Justice and other groups that went to the Trump rally to protest.  Video footage that has been circulated on social and traditional media shows people in Traditionalist Worker Party t-shirts pushing people, notably a young black woman, and taking their protest signs. Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in an email that the campaign does not comment on security matters.  The Traditionalist Worker Party did not respond to requests for comment, and its website, tradworker.org, does not say where it is based.   Matthew Heimbach, the groups chairman, wrote in a blog on the website of the Traditionalist Youth Network that the protesters, including those from Black Lives Matter, were the aggressors. And he tweeted, Its (sic) funny how BLM comes to a Trump event to fight, starts the fight and then loses the fight but plays big victims to the media.  Southern Poverty Law Centers Lentz said, Matthew is a figure who is core to the white nationalists and white supremacist culture as it is right now in the U.S.  For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, Tales from the Trail (here).

South Dakota House fails to override veto of transgender bathroom bill,"(Reuters) - The South Dakota House of Representatives failed on Thursday to override a veto by Governor Dennis Daugaard of a bill that would have made the state the first in the United States to dictate what bathrooms transgender students can use in public schools.  By a vote of 36-29, supporters of the bill did not muster the two-thirds vote required in both chambers to override the veto. The Republican-controlled House had approved the bill beyond that threshold in January.     The proposed law would have required transgender pupils to use restrooms and locker rooms in public schools that correspond to their gender at birth.  Supporters, including conservative Christian groups such as Family Heritage Alliance Action, said the bill would enhance the privacy of all students. But civil rights groups said the measure would expose schools to legal challenges over access to restrooms and that it violated Title IX, a federal rule regarding discrimination in public schools. Fairness and equality have prevailed over this unconscionable legislative assault on transgender children, said Chad Griffin, president of the Washington-based Human Rights Campaign, a gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender civil rights organization, reacting to the vote on Thursday. The bill would have required schools to provide reasonable accommodations for transgender students. Those accommodations include a single-occupancy restroom, a unisex restroom or the supervised use of a restroom, locker room or shower room designated for use by faculty. In vetoing the bill on Tuesday, Daugaard, a Republican, said it would invite conflict and litigation, diverting resources from education. In December, a suburban Chicago school district reached an accord with the U.S. government over locker room access for a transgender student after the U.S. Department of Educations Office of Civil Rights found the district discriminated against the student in violation of Title IX.  Daugaards veto came about a month after a U.S. appeals court heard arguments over whether a high school in Virginia should be ordered to allow a transgender male student to use the boys bathroom. Last week, local lawmakers in Charlotte, North Carolina, voted to allow transgender people to use public bathrooms matching their gender identity. Republican State House of Representatives Speaker Tim Moore said he would consider legislation to block the measure. ",politicsNews,"March 3, 2016 ",1
U.S. senators urge Obama to push for female U.N. Secretary-General,"UNITED NATIONS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Seven U.S. women senators urged President Barack Obama on Thursday to push for the election of the United Nations first female secretary-general later this year. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, a former South Korean foreign minister, is due to step down at the end of 2016 after two five-year terms. A man has held the top job at the world organization since its inception 70 years ago.  The 15-member Security Council, including veto powers China, Russia, the United States, Britain and France, will recommend a candidate for election by the 193-member General Assembly to succeed Ban. We ask that the United States play a leading role in pressing for the strong consideration of qualified women, the seven Democratic senators wrote to Obama. Led by Barbara Boxer, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the letter was also signed by senators Patty Murray, Mazie Hirono, Tammy Baldwin, Kirsten Gillibrand, Jeanne Shaheen and Barbara Mikulski. In response to the senators letter, a senior Obama administration official said: While we would welcome the selection of a woman as the next Secretary-General, we will ultimately support the best candidate of either gender. Fifty-three 53 countries, led by Colombia, are pushing for a female secretary-general. Several civil society groups are also lobbying for a woman to lead the organization. Seven candidates have been put forward, including three women: U.N. cultural organization (UNESCO) Director-General Irina Bokova, former Croatian Foreign Minister Vesna Pusic and Moldovas former Foreign Minister Natalia Gherman.  The other four candidates are former Macedonian Foreign Minister Srgjan Kerim, Montenegro Foreign Minister Igor Luksic, former Slovenian President Danilo Turk and former U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres.  I would say Guterres has got the better chance of all of those who have entered the race, but I still dont think the winning candidate has entered yet, a senior Security Council diplomat said on condition of anonymity.  Diplomats said other potential female candidates included Helen Clark, former New Zealand prime minister and head of the U.N. Development Programme; Argentine Foreign Minister Susana Malcorra; and European Union Commissioner for Budget and Human Resources Kristalina Georgieva.  The U.N. top job traditionally rotates between regions, with Eastern Europe next on the list. While the U.N. has upheld the consideration of regional rotation, it has not given full consideration to gender equality, the U.S. senators wrote.  A U.S. congressional aide said other female senators, including Republicans, were approached to back the letter to Obama, but none had yet signed on. Most Republicans see many of the U.N.s actions as attempts to improperly influence U.S. policy. ",politicsNews,"March 3, 2016 ",1
Kentucky governor sues to close abortion clinic,"(Reuters) - Kentuckys Republican Governor Matt Bevin has filed a lawsuit asking a judge to close an abortion clinic in Lexington, saying it was operating without a license. The lawsuit filed in Fayette Circuit Court on Wednesday alleges that the EMW Womens Clinic was unsanitary, maintained expired medication on the site and does not have an adequate agreement to transfer patients to a hospital in case of an emergency, according to court documents. A call placed to the clinic was not immediately returned. The Lexington clinic is one of three in Kentucky that provide abortions, according to local media. The Lexington Herald Leader said that the governors office filed a lawsuit last month against Planned Parenthood, saying it did not have the proper license to perform abortions at its Louisville clinic. Planned Parenthood has responded that it does have the proper licensing under an agreement with the former governor, the Herald Leader reported. According to this weeks lawsuit, filed on behalf of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the state health service, and signed by the governors general counsel, EMW Womens Clinic does not provide any care other than abortions, and therefore needs a specific type of license that it does not have. Bevin ran for governor on an anti-abortion platform and in February signed an informed consent law that requires women to consult with a doctor before having an abortion.

Michigan governor issues appeal over Flint funds denial,"(Reuters) - Michigan Governor Rick Snyder has urged federal officials to reconsider their denial for funds to help deal with the crisis caused by lead-contaminated water in the city of Flint, his office said on Thursday.  The contamination and the states long delay in addressing the problem have sparked outrage and drawn attention from U.S. presidential candidates. In the latest appeal to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Snyder is requesting money to pay for food, water and other essential needs; the removal of health and safety hazards; activation of emergency operations centers; measures to avoid further damage; and homeowners repairs not covered by insurance. A FEMA spokesman said Snyders appeal was under review by the agency. The agency turned down an earlier request for financial help in January because the areas in which Snyder requested aid were deemed not appropriate, but has provided non-monetary support in the form of a FEMA coordinator.  Also in January, Snyder asked for federal declarations of emergency and major disaster. President Barack Obama approved the federal emergency declaration, but denied a major disaster declaration. Snyder appealed that decision and was denied.    Snyder said on Thursday that Flint needed continued local, state, federal and national efforts. Assistance from our federal partners could go a long way in moving Flint forward, he said. Activists and some Democratic state lawmakers have demanded that Snyder resign, but a spokesman said the Republican governor had no intention of stepping down. Snyder is scheduled to testify before a U.S. congressional committee on March 17. Also on Thursday, Snyder said the federal government approved a waiver allowing for Medicaid coverage for children and pregnant women in Flint. Flint, a predominantly black city of 100,000 about 60 miles (100 km) northwest of Detroit, was under the control of a state-appointed emergency manager when it switched the source of its tap water from Detroits system to the Flint River in April 2014.     The city switched back last October after tests found high levels of lead in blood samples taken from children. Water from the Flint River, which was more corrosive than Detroits, leached lead from the citys pipes, posing widespread health risks. Experts have said it could take some time for anti-corrosive chemicals now being added to the water to re-coat pipes so that they will not leach more lead.  Meanwhile, Flint officials said they would begin replacing lead pipes running to homes with copper on Friday as part of a $55 million project. ",politicsNews,"March 3, 2016 ",1
Obama: 20 million Americans insured thanks to 'Obamacare',"MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Thursday that some 20 million Americans had become insured as a result of the Affordable Care Act, his signature healthcare law also known as Obamacare. During a trip to Wisconsin to tout the program, Obama said he hoped Republicans would work with him during his final months in office to improve the law, which they have tried unsuccessfully to repeal. Today I can announce that thanks to the law, 20 million more Americans now know the security of health insurance, Obama told a crowd in Milwaukee after being introduced by a local man who said the law saved his life. The man, Brent Brown, said he was a Republican who had not voted for the Democratic president. The law was passed in 2010 and Republicans have sought to repeal it ever since. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the estimates Obama referenced included coverage from the expansion of the Medicaid program, health insurance marketplaces, and provisions that allowed young people to stay on their parents private insurance plans longer. The 20 million figure was an update to a September 2015 government estimate that 17.6 million Americans had been insured as a result of the Affordable Care Act. ",politicsNews,"March 3, 2016 ",1
New Jersey Governor Christie says he urged Trump not to leave Republican Party,"(Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said on Thursday he has urged Donald Trump not to leave the Republican Party, saying it remains unified despite scathing criticism of Trumps  presidential candidacy by a senior party leader earlier on Thursday. I have urged him not to leave the party, said Christie, a former candidate himself, who gave Trump a major boost last week when he endorsed him for the partys nomination for the Nov. 8 election. I dont think thats a constructive way to go about it, and he knows that, Christie told reporters. Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to leave the Republican Party if it does not respect him, told ABC News on Thursday that Republicans should be glad he has brought millions more people into the party: Theyre leaving the Democrats. Theyre leaving the independents. And theyre with me 100 percent. The New York real estate magnate is the clear front-runner to be the Republican nominee in November but is facing heavy criticism from many in the party establishment - including a blistering speech on Thursday by the partys 2012 presidential candidate, Mitt Romney. U.S. Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, and Ohio Governor John Kasich are trailing Trump in their bids for the nomination, but are trying to coalesce the support of establishment Republicans to topple Trump before or at the partys nominating convention in July. Trump told MSNBC that the increasing number of ads from the establishment targeting him are really unfair, and that he could depart the party to run as an independent. If I leave, if I go ... which I may do, I mean, may or may not, but if I go, I will tell you these millions of people that joined, theyve told them, theyre all coming with me, he said. Concern about Trump among Republicans increased at the weekend over his failure to quickly disavow support from a leading white supremacist.     Ive know Donald Trump for 14 years, and Donald Trump is not a bigot, Christie told a news conference in New Jersey. In fact, Donald Trump is someone I think who has given a lot of opportunity to a lot of people of a lot of different backgrounds, and I disagree with Governor Romney on that one.

Romney's anti-Trump speech ignites social media debate,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - If Mitt Romney wanted to ignite a debate about Donald Trumps suitability for the White House, he succeeded, at least on social media. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, lambasted Trump in a speech on Thursday in Salt Lake City, Utah, calling him a phony, a fraud and saying it is his very brand of anger that has led other nations into the abyss. The speech was the latest illustration of how badly many mainstream Republican leaders want to stop Trump, the clear front-runner, from becoming his partys nominee in Novembers election to succeed President Barack Obama. Twitter users posted about Romney roughly 38 times per second following the speech, according to Zoomph, the social media analytics firm. Romneys sentiment score, a measure of how positively users discuss a topic, was slightly higher than Trumps following the speech, according to the firm. Mitt Romney quickly became one of the top-trending topics on Twitter in the United States. In a period of about four hours after the former Massachusetts governors speech, there were roughly 529,000 tweets about Romney on Twitter, according to the social media sites own metrics. Trumps response, a barrage of put-downs, also generated social media attention. During a campaign rally in Maine, Trump said Romney had begged him for an endorsement when he was running for the White House in 2012. Trumps comments included what many on social media perceived to be a crude sexual joke. I could have said Mitt, drop to your knees, he would have dropped to his knees, Trump said. Is this a new @realDonaldTrump campaign slogan? Drop to Your Knees, America ... and they did, tweeted Carl Spry (@CarlSpry). His secret to getting so many endorsements?. Romney said later he would not have accepted Trumps endorsement four years ago if Trump had spoken as he does now. If Trump had said 4 years ago the things he says today about the KKK, Muslims, Mexicans, disabled, I would NOT have accepted his endorsement, Romney tweeted (@MittRomney), referring to the white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan. In his speech slamming both Trumps policy proposals and his style, Romney did not endorse any of the candidates remaining in the Republican race. But one of them, Ohio Governor John Kasich (@JohnKasich), tweeted his support, saying Well said, @MittRomney. A photo of the presidential Oval Office accompanied the tweet, with the caption The One Who Works Here Should Make Us Proud. Other presidential candidates remained quiet on Twitter, but Republican South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley offered her support for Romney. A brilliant speech by @MittRomney. No one can ever question his love for our party and our country. #TrueLeadership #MittRomney, she (@nikkihaley) tweeted.  Haley has endorsed Marco Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida,  for the Republican nomination.

"No sign of end to fight on U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Rubio holds firm","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential hopeful Marco Rubio has no plans to allow a vote on President Barack Obamas nominee to be ambassador to Mexico, a spokesman said on Thursday, despite calls from his fellow Republicans and Democrats in the Senate to let her confirmation move ahead. The long delay in confirming career diplomat Roberta Jacobson has contributed to concerns about the state of U.S.-Mexico relations fueled by aggressive rhetoric against its citizens in the race to be the 2016 Republican nominee. Three Democratic and one Republican U.S. senator held a news conference on Thursday calling for her nomination to move ahead. There has been no U.S. ambassador in Mexico City for nine months. Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, has labeled Mexicans drug runners and rapists and called for a massive wall along the border. Rubio and fellow Republican Senator Ted Cruz have also proposed building a wall. Obama nominated Jacobson in June. She has faced resistance from Rubio and some other lawmakers, however, for reasons including her role in helping negotiate Obamas easing of relations with Communist-ruled Cuba and what they say is the administrations failure to prioritize human rights. Rubio, a Cuban-American from Florida, has been a leading opponent of the policy, saying Havana should improve its rights record before trade and travel restrictions are eased. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved Jacobsons nomination in November, with Republican and Democratic support. But Rubio has been blocking her, under a Senate rule allowing any member to hold a nomination indefinitely. Senator Rubio maintains his strong opposition to this nominee on the basis of her failure to be transparent during the confirmation process, inability to provide straightforward answers, and poor track record on a wide range of issues as the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos said. Senators from states that border Mexico held a news conference with the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce calling for Jacobsons confirmation, citing the importance of the U.S.-Mexico relationship. Mexico is the second largest market for U.S. exports and the countrys third-largest trading partner. Its extremely important, said Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona. Democrat Tom Udall of New Mexico, who tried to bring up Jacobsons nomination in the Senate but was blocked by Republican Mike Lee on Rubios behalf, said he was confident Jacobson would be confirmed if a vote went ahead.

U.S. defense chief urges Congress to stick to bipartisan budget deal,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter Thursday urged Congress to stick to a bipartisan budget agreement that locked in spending levels for fiscal 2016 and 2017, warning that reopening the deal would lead to inefficiencies and could raise concerns overseas. Carter told military leaders and industry at an event hosted by Microsoft Corp that the Department of Defense needed greater stability to plan its spending levels and prepare for the complex challenges it faces around the world. Weve got to come together in Washington and break the gridlock for such important functions as funding the federal government, Carter said. We cant go in every fiscal year with chaos and continuing resolutions. Thats a money waster ... because it causes us to manage inefficiently. Carter said he worried that Congress could undermine the two-year budget agreement that set funding levels for this fiscal year and the one that begins Oct. 1. I really hope the bipartisan budget agreement sticks, Carter said, noting that it was even more difficult to maintain such deals in a presidential election year. U.S. defense officials worry that Republican moves to add funding to the Pentagons fiscal 2017 budget plan could jeopardize the budget deal. Carter said the turbulence caused by recent budget battles was not helpful for managing the Pentagon and gave allies and potential enemies the false impression that the U.S. military was in disarray when it was actually investing well overall.

Cuba sending Americans to the beach during Obama visit,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Americans traveling to Cuba later this month are being moved out of Havana hotels to make room for President Barack Obamas entourage and being sent tantalizingly close to a place U.S. law effectively forbids them from visiting: the beach.  Obama will make his historic trip to the Communist-ruled Caribbean island on March 21-22 with hundreds of people in tow, crowning 15 months of warming relations after more than half a century of Cold War animosity. Cuba is already experiencing a tourism boom and March is traditionally its busiest month. The Obama visit has put additional strain on hotels that have already been booked to capacity for much of the high season. Major Havana hotels are being cleared, according to the head of a U.S. travel company who asked not to be identified for concern it would damage future business relations. Just got notice that the Capri, Panorama, Nacional, half of Parque Central and potentially other hotels have been told to send all guests to Varadero from the 19th to 23rd of March, he wrote in an e-mail. The Varadero resort, an hours drive east of Havana, is Cubas most sought after tourism destination, with sandy white beaches, shimmering waters and plentiful hotels. But the beach is off limits to Americans as U.S. restrictions on travel to the island expressly forbid tourism in Cuba. Americans are limited to authorized travel such as educational and cultural exchanges. This means most U.S. visitors are concentrated in Havana, where there are lots of cultural sites and activities, a rocky seafront and scarce hotel rooms. The Cuban government is clearing out Havana hotels and sending visiting U.S. groups to Varadero Beach for a long weekend, said Collin Laverty, president of Cuban Educational Travel, which organizes authorized U.S. travel groups. Tourism will be hard to avoid for a few days as U.S. visitors are surrounded by white sand, turquoise water and all you can eat and drink bars and buffets, he added. But we will try.      Cuban travel agencies were not immediately available for comment. Following the U.S.-Cuban detente announced by Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro in December 2014, American visits to Cuba soared 77 percent in 2015 to 161,000 visitors. Cuba is expecting a similar increase this year. Obama, a Democrat, has loosened travel restrictions to the once-forbidden land as well as some other trade barriers. But only Congress, currently controlled by Republicans, can lift the U.S. embargo and its ban on tourism, in place since the early 1960s. ",politicsNews,"March 3, 2016 ",1
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's ratings slide in state poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christies approval ratings have fallen after the one-time presidential hopeful endorsed Republican front-runner Donald Trump, according to a statewide opinion poll. The poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University, released on Wednesday, showed that Christies approval rating fell to 27 percent from 33 percent before the endorsement.  The drop was greater among those without party affiliation, with approval falling to 18 percent from 34 percent among that group. Only 29 percent said New Jersey was headed in the right direction, with 59 percent saying it was not. Fairleigh Dickinson said the rating was the lowest it had recorded during Christies tenure. Christie has drawn fire for spending much of his time out of the state while campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination. He was expected to return to New Jersey politics after he dropped out of the running, but endorsing Trump has put him back on the campaign trail. The most recent survey by Fairleigh Dickinsons PublicMind was conducted Feb. 24-28 by telephone. It had a randomly selected sample of 694 self-identified registered voters in New Jersey.

U.S. top court denies bid to block mercury air pollution rule,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court sided with the Obama administration on Thursday in rebuffing a bid by 20 states to halt an Environmental Protection Agency rule to curb emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants from power plants. The action came about a month after the high court put on hold federal regulations to curb carbon dioxide emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants, the centerpiece of President Barack Obamas strategy to combat climate change. Chief Justice John Roberts denied a petition made last week by the states, led by Michigan, to put the rule on hold after a federal appeals court decided in December to leave it intact while the EPA reassessed costs of implementing the regulation. The states had argued that a stay was necessary because the Supreme Court had already held that the finding on which the rule rests is unlawful and beyond the EPAs statutory authority. The Supreme Court ruled last June that the EPA should have considered compliance costs when it decided to limit emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants mainly from coal-fired power plants, and returned the case to the appeals court. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit subsequently said the regulations could remain in place while the government responds to the high courts June ruling. The appeals court gave the EPA until April 15 to come up with compliance costs. The EPA rule, which went into effect last April, applies to about 1,400 electricity-generating units at 600 power plants. Many are already in compliance. EPA spokeswoman Melissa Harrison said the agency was very pleased with Roberts action, noting that power plants are the largest source of mercury pollution in the United States.  These practical and achievable standards cut harmful pollution from power plants, saving thousands of lives each year and preventing heart and asthma attacks, Harrison said. Environmental groups and 15 other states that had asked the court to reject the stay request applauded Roberts action and called on the attorneys general in the group of states led by Michigan to end their legal challenge to the rule. The rule is safeguarding millions of American children from poisons such as mercury, arsenic and acid gases, said Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund anti-pollution advocacy group, a party to the case.

Donald Trump Jr. appears with white supremacist on radio show,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of Donald Trumps sons appeared along with a white supremacist while giving an interview on a conservative radio show, adding to concerns that the front-runner in the battle to be the Republican candidate in Novembers presidential election is willing to accept support from extremist supporters. Donald Trump Jr., who is actively campaigning for his father, gave an interview on Tuesday on Liberty Roundtable, a conservative Utah-based radio show hosted by Sam Bushman. During the show he was questioned by James Edwards, another radio host whose show The Political Cesspool is described by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a leading U.S. civil rights group, asracist and anti-Semitic.  During the interview, conducted over the telephone, Trump Jr. talked about what a good father Donald Trump was and how his campaign is changing the Republican Party. Its not a campaign anymore, its a movement, he told his interviewers. (here) Edwards said on his blog on Tuesday he would rebroadcast the 20-minute interview on Saturday on ""The Political Cesspool."" here The show, founded in 2005 and syndicated by Bushmans Liberty News Radio organization, has featured such extremists as former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and Holocaust denier Willis Carto. Edwards also said on his blog he had attended a Memphis rally for the billionaire candidate as a credentialed media member last Saturday. The Trump campaign, asked about an interview in the presence of the Tennessee-based Edwards, denied any knowledge of it. The campaign also said it did not know about Edwards personal views. The campaign provided media credentials to everyone that requested access to the event on Saturday in Memphis. There were close to 200 reporters in attendance and we do not personally vet each individual. The campaign had no knowledge of his personal views and strongly condemns them.  Donald Trump Jr. was not in attendance and although he served as a surrogate for his father on several radio programs over the past week, to his knowledge and that of the campaign, he did not participate in an interview with this individual, campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in an email.     Edwards, in an email, directed questions about the interview to Bushman, but said in a statement: My show,The Political Cesspool,promotes a proud, paleoconservative Christian worldview, and we reject media descriptions of our work as white supremacist, pro-slavery and other such scare words. As I clearly wrote inyesterdays article,in no way should anyone interpret our press credentialing and subsequent interview with Donald Trump, Jr. as any kind of endorsement by the Trump campaign. Donald Trump won a majority of the states holding nominating contests on Super Tuesday, accelerating his march to the Republican nomination. He has promised to build a wall on the Mexican border, temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States and block Syrian refugees because they might be militants, all policies popular with some U.S. right-wing groups. Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress on Tuesday condemned white supremacist groups after Trump earlier failed to disavow support for former Klan leader Duke, but the leaders declined further comment on Trumps White House bid. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said any Republican nominee must reject any group built on bigotry while Senate leader Mitch McConnell said Senate Republicans condemned groups such as the Klan and everything they stand for.

U.S. senator calls for GAO probe to protect babies born drug-dependent,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The ranking Democrat on the U.S. Senate subcommittee on children and families wants a congressional watchdog agency to investigate whether states are complying with a federal law meant to protect newborns in drug withdrawal and help their families. In a letter sent this week to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, Senator Robert Casey of Pennsylvania asked that the probe examine what steps Congress or the Obama Administration could take to improve compliance and save the lives of vulnerable infants. The request comes in response to a Reuters investigation in December that identified the preventable deaths of 110 babies whose mothers used opioids during pregnancy and were subsequently sent home to families ill-equipped to care for them. A 2003 federal law calls on states to require that healthcare workers notify child protection services when a baby is born affected by illegal substance abuse or has symptoms of drug withdrawal. Such reports are not to be used as evidence of abuse, the law says, but rather to help develop a plan of safe care for the newborns after they leave the hospital. Reuters found that no more than nine states and the District of Columbia appear to follow the law. Even so, no state had lost federal funding from failing to abide by the provision. More than 27,000 newborns in the United States were diagnosed with drug withdrawal syndrome in 2013  five times the number diagnosed with the condition in 2003. Reuters groundbreaking report on the condition of children born with opioid dependencies should be a call to action for all members of Congress, Casey said in a separate statement. Cathleen Palm, executive director of the Center for Childrens Justice, a Pennsylvania non-profit advocacy group, supported Caseys action. By GAO and Congress saying we want states to tangibly tell us what they are doing, its going to force them to really look at it, Palm said. It just feels like were about to get a whole lot more motivated about these babies and their families. Mark Weber, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees compliance with the law, said the agency will work with the GAO when an inquiry is made.

"Trump makes overture to Ryan, while Republicans wrestle with party's future","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump, leading the pack for the Republican presidential nomination, has reached out to House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, it was disclosed on Wednesday, even as some Republicans strategized over how to potentially knock the billionaire businessmans campaign off its stride. The Trump campaign contacted Ryans office late on Monday, a spokeswoman for Ryan said, on the eve of the Super Tuesday nominating contests in which hundreds of delegates were at stake for the Republican candidates. The Trump overture also came a day before the Republican speaker publicly admonished Trump over his failure to repudiate the backing of his candidacy by a white supremacist group. Trump responded with a warning to Ryan. We have heard from the (Trump) campaign, but the two have not yet spoken, Ryan spokesman Brendan Buck said in a statement released on Twitter on Wednesday, one day after Trump swept victories in seven of the 11 states that held Republican nominating contests on the biggest day in the primary season. Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong did not describe the subject or details of Trumps overture to the speaker. After months of shrugging off Trumps candidacy, Republicans are now grappling with the distinct possibility that he may be their partys nominee to take on the Democrats, likely led by Hillary Clinton, in the Nov. 8 presidential election.  A Republican senator who asked not to be identified, and a senior aide to another Republican senator, told Reuters that many private conversations were underway on Capitol Hill about finding ways to slow or stop Trump. People are leaning on people everywhere, to convince Ohio Governor John Kasich to exit the race so the party can unify around a single Trump alternative, either Senator Marco Rubio or Senator Ted Cruz. Kasich, however, was expected to stay in at least until the Ohio primary on March 15. At the core of such conversations, said the aide and another senior Senate Republican aide, who also asked not to be identified, is avoiding a deadlock at the Republican convention, which would forever result in the loss of our base, said one of the aides.  Ryan has until this week avoided commenting on the presidential race. On Tuesday he said any Republican nominee must reject any group built on bigotry. The remark was aimed at Trump after Trump did not immediately repudiate support from a white supremacist group over the weekend. Trump fired back at Ryan in a news conference in Florida on Tuesday night, warning the speaker would pay a big price if he stood in Trumps way. Ryans office did not say on Wednesday when the two men might talk. But Ryans spokesman said the speaker planned to be in touch with all of the Republican presidential candidates soon to discuss the conservative policy agenda.

Mexico says won't pay for Trump's 'terrible' border wall,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - There is no way Mexico would fund Donald Trumps terrible plan to build a wall along its border with the United States if the Republican front-runner wins the U.S. presidential election, the Mexican finance minister said. Trump, the New York billionaire developer and former reality television star, sparked outrage in Mexico when he vowed to force Latin Americas second largest economy to pay for a wall along the southern U.S. border to stem the flow of illegal immigration and drugs. In a televised interview late on Wednesday, Finance Minister Luis Videgaray categorically rejected the proposal.     Under no circumstance will Mexico pay for the wall that Mr. Trump is proposing, he said. Building a wall between Mexico and the United States is a terrible idea. It is an idea based on ignorance and has no foundation in the reality of North American integration. Trump has accused Mexico of sending rapists and drug runners across the U.S. border and has vowed to increase fees on some Mexican visas and all border crossing cards as part of a broader plan to force Mexico to pay for the wall. Former conservative Mexican presidents Felipe Calderon and Vicente Fox have compared Trump to Adolf Hitler while fears of a Trump presidency have helped stoke a spike in the numbers of immigrants trying to enter the United States.

"Carson signals exit, U.S. Republicans grapple with Trump victories","(Reuters) - Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson signaled on Wednesday he was quitting the Republican presidential race, leaving three candidates facing Donald Trump as the party establishment struggled to find a way to halt the outspoken businessman. Carson, a conservative who briefly led opinion polls among Republicans earlier in the campaign, said he did not see a political path forward after performing poorly in this weeks Super Tuesday nominating contests. He said he would not participate in a Republican debate on Thursday. Despite a push by some mainstream Republicans to try to block Trump from winning the nomination, the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers will not deploy their $400 million political arsenal to attack him in the presidential primary campaign.        As a conservative black Republican, Carson, 64, stood out in the mostly white Republican Party, but his campaign foundered amid staff infighting and questions about Carsons familiarity with foreign policy. His departure is unlikely to have a major impact on the fight among Republicans to become the partys candidate in the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. Reuters/Ipsos polling last month showed Carson supporters would mostly likely be split if he dropped out between Trump and U.S. Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas.  Trump consolidated his lead in the Republican race with a string of victories on Tuesday that moved him closer to    becoming the nominee. The 69-year-old New York real estate tycoon won seven states from Massachusetts to the conservative Deep South. His victories compounded the problem for a party whose leaders are critical of many of Trumps positions and values and skeptical he can defeat the likely Democratic nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Trump has showered insults on rivals and is facing strong party disapproval over his ideas to build a wall between the United States and Mexico, deport 11 million illegal immigrants and temporarily bar Muslims from entering the country. The 2012 Republican nominee, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, plans to deliver a rebuke of Trump on Thursday in a speech in Utah, sources familiar with his thinking said. It will be a high-profile display of establishment Republican unease. Romneys speech comes on the same day that Trump and his  remaining rivals, Rubio, Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich share a debate stage in Detroit, hosted by Fox News. The Koch brothers, the most powerful conservative mega donors in the United States, have no plans to get involved in the Republican primary process, James Davis, spokesman for Freedom Partners, the brothers political umbrella group, told Reuters.         Donors and media reports have speculated that the brothers would launch a Trump Intervention, a strategy that would involve deploying the Kochs vast political network to target Trump in hopes of removing him from the race.   Trump has reached out to House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the most senior Republican in Congress. The Trump campaign contacted Ryans office late on Monday, a day before the speaker publicly admonished Trump over his failure to repudiate the backing of his candidacy by a white supremacist group. Trump responded with a warning to Ryan.     Among Trumps rivals, Cruz, 45, won three states on Tuesday, bolstering the conservative senators argument that he has the best chance of stopping former reality TV star Trump. The Republican establishments favored 2016 candidate, Rubio, only won one Super Tuesday state, taking Minnesota. Anti-Trump Republicans have yet to coalesce around a single strategy to halt him, but the conservative group Club for Growth claimed credit for slowing Trump in some primary states by running attack ads. It said it would air a new advertisement in Florida as part of a $1.5 million ad buy. Some party donors - including hedge-fund manager Paul Singer and Meg Whitman, the Hewlett-Packard Enterprise chief executive - organized a phone call on Tuesday to get funding for an anti-Trump effort, The New York Times reported.  But one of Trumps former rivals in the 2016 race, Mike Huckabee, admonished Republicans for not respecting the will of the voters. The establishment Republicans are all bed-wetting over this and they dont seem to understand that we have an election, the former Arkansas governor said on Fox News. Lets remember that we have an election process, not a selection process. Trump responded to the furor against him, saying in a tweet on Wednesday: The special interests and people who control our politicians (puppets) are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent T.V. ads on me. Trump later unveiled proposals for reforming U.S. healthcare that included repealing Obamacare, allowing prescription drugs to be imported, and turning the Medicaid program for the poor into block grants to states. Democrats pounced on the Republican campaign infighting.     Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid called Trump a monster the Republicans spawned with their years of rancorous opposition to all major Obama administration initiatives. Republicans created him by spending seven years appealing to some of the darkest forces in America, Reid said on the Senate floor. In the Democratic race, Clinton, 68, took big steps on Tuesday toward securing her partys nomination, the 2016 campaigns biggest day of state-by-state nominating contests. Clintons rival, U.S Senator Bernie Sanders, 74, won his home state of Vermont along with Colorado, Minnesota and Oklahoma.

Immunity to State Dept staffer who set up Clinton email server: WashPost,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has given immunity from prosecution to a State Department employee who helped set up and manage the private email server Hillary Clinton used for her work as secretary of state, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday. A senior U.S. law enforcement official said the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had secured the cooperation of Bryan Pagliano, who worked on Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign before joining the State Department with her and setting up the server in her New York home in 2009, the newspaper reported. (wapo.st/1RqkIk2) The Post described the investigation as a criminal inquiry, a label Clinton and her staff have resisted as they seek to reassure voters that the frontrunner to become the Democratic Partys nominee in Novembers presidential election is not in legal jeopardy. Clinton has said she did nothing wrong and that she believes the U.S. government will vindicate her. She has also apologized for what she said was poor judgment. In 2014, Clinton returned about 30,000 emails to the State Department, but said she chose not to keep thousands of others her staff deemed not to be work-related. Her staff have acknowledged that other work emails were not handed over, without explaining why. More than 2,000 of Clintons work emails contain classified information that could harm national security if exposed, according the State Department, including 22 classified as top secret, the highest level. The government forbids sending or storing classified emails through unsecured, non-government channels, and has prosecuted people for breaches. Brian Fallon, a Clinton spokesman, said in a statement that Clintons campaign was pleased that Pagliano was cooperating. The Justice Department and FBI declined to comment on whether Pagliano had been granted immunity, and his lawyer did not respond to questions. Last month, a federal judge overseeing a civil lawsuit against the State Department ruled that department officials and aides to Clinton could be questioned under oath about whether her use of a private email system was an effort to skirt open records laws. The FBI is likely to ask Clinton and her aides in coming months how the server was set up and whether they knew they were sending classified information in emails, the Post reported. Pagliano has declined to testify to lawmakers, citing a constitutional right against self-incrimination. Republicans have called for Clintons prosecution. This terrible error in judgment coupled with Clintons arrogant and dishonest claims shows she cant be trusted with the presidency, Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committees chairman, said in a statement.

Republican Trump releases healthcare proposals,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential front-runner candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled proposals for reforming U.S. healthcare that included repealing Obamacare, allowing prescription drugs to be imported, and turning the Medicaid program for the poor into block grants to states. The plan also calls for the sale of health insurance plans across state lines, full deduction of health insurance premiums from income tax and adds: ""We must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance.""  (here) Trump, who is the front-runner in the race to become the Republican nominee in Novembers presidential election, is also proposing allowing individuals to use Health Savings Accounts (HAS) to pay for out-of-pocket expenses. Contributions to HSAs would be tax-free and could be passed on to heirs without any tax penalty. The proposals include requiring ...price transparency from all healthcare providers, especially doctors and healthcare organizations like clinics and hospitals. Individuals should be able to shop to find the best prices for procedures, exams or any other medical-related procedure.          On drug prices, Trump departs from standard Republican policy by calling for lowering barriers to cheaper imported pharmaceuticals. Allowing consumers access to imported, safe and dependable drugs from overseas will bring more options to consumers, the statement says, adding that Congress will need the courage to step away from the special interests and do what is right for America. The proposals also call for reforming mental health programs and institutions, but provides few details about how to do this. Trump also called for tighter enforcement of immigration laws, a key plank in his campaign platform, as a way to bring down healthcare costs. Providing healthcare to illegal immigrants costs us some $11 billion annually. If we were to simply enforce the current immigration laws and restrict the unbridled granting of visas to this country, we could relieve healthcare cost pressures on state and local governments, the proposal statement says.     Democrats were quick to criticize the plan. As Democrats have said all along, Donald Trump is not an outsider engaging in a hostile takeover of the GOP  in fact, he embodies the Republican Party. The fact that his healthcare plan is clearly cribbed from worn-out and false GOP talking points proves that Trump is just another Republican politician who wants to take healthcare away from millions of Americans without offering any substantive alternative, Democratic National Committee Communications Director Luis Miranda said in a statement.

"Another debate brawl? Fox News, Kelly set for Trump rematch","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Thursdays Republican debate on Fox News Channel could be Round 2 of Megyn Kelly versus Donald Trump. But the journalist and fellow moderators say they are not preparing to stoke the fire with questions about his headline-grabbing battles with the network. Trump accused Kelly of lobbing him tougher questions than those directed at his rivals in an August debate that was the Republican candidates first televised encounter. Kelly asked about Trumps remarks about women, prompting a stream of attacks from the candidate, who skipped a Fox debate in January. Frankly, I have been ready for seven months to move beyond what happened after that August debate, Kelly said in a recent interview. I feel like its getting boring. Trump has bigger things to worry about, and so do I. The brash billionaires unfiltered style has helped generate unprecedented ratings for news networks including Fox, owned by Rupert Murdochs 21st Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O). The cable channels August debate attracted 24 million viewers, a record for a presidential primary debate on any network, according to Nielsen. The January forum without Trump drew 12.5 million, still the second-largest audience in the networks history. Trump is set to appear at Thursdays rematch with Fox News anchors Kelly, Bret Baier and Chris Wallace. Mr. Trump will be at the debate tomorrow and looks forward to participating, spokeswoman Hope Hicks said on Wednesday. The moderators said they do not plan to mention Trumps comments about Kelly, his complaints about unfair treatment by the cable news network or his absence from Foxs January debate.  Kelly said she has not prepared a comeback if Trump gets personal. I have my questions, she said. Thats all I need. Last weeks debate on Time Warner Incs (TWX.N) CNN turned into a raucous match where rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio ganged up on Trump, who fired back. Wallace called it an embarrassment to Republicans. The three seemed hell-bent on taking out each other on a lot of fairly minor points, he said, rather than discussing issues that affect peoples lives. On Tuesday, Trump and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton took big steps toward securing their parties nominations with a series of state-by-state victories.   After 10 Republican debates, there remains plenty to explore because the remaining candidates - Trump, Cruz, Rubio and John Kasich - have now staked out positions, Kelly said.  They will have to own those positions or try to wiggle out, she said. But there is not that much wiggle room left on some of these things. A fifth candidate, Ben Carson, appeared set to end his campaign and said he would skip Thursdays debate. Cruz has clashed with Wallace on air and accused him of being too soft on Trump. The contenders try to work the refs and complain and hope they will get it a little easier next time, Wallace said. All three moderators said they ask tough questions of each candidate. I think Fox has been fair across the board, Baier said. He said he hopes for a discussion that is fiery but the most substantive debate so far as rivals try to score points.    We will let the contrasts and the conversations between candidates go, Baier said. But there will be some balance. Thats what its always about, not letting it get off the rails.

Key justice Kennedy wavers as Supreme Court confronts abortion,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A closely divided Supreme Court struggled with its biggest abortion case in years on Wednesday, with pivotal Justice Anthony Kennedy voicing concerns about a restrictive Texas law yet stopping short of signaling he would strike it down. The courts four liberal justices indicated they believed the law, which imposes strict regulations on abortion doctors and clinic buildings, intrudes on a womans constitutional right to end a pregnancy established in a 1973 ruling. Conservative justices including Kennedy expressed doubt during the 85-minute oral argument about claims by abortion providers who asserted that the Republican-backed 2013 law forced numerous clinics to shut down. Kennedy at one point suggested sending the case back to a lower court to get further evidence on the laws impact, including an assessment of the ability of existing Texas clinics to meet the demand for abortions.  If there is evidence new clinics that meet the states regulations have increased capacity to perform abortions, it would show the law has provided a beneficial effect, Kennedy said. The outcome appeared to be in the hands of Kennedy, who often casts the deciding vote in close rulings. In past abortion cases, he has backed a fundamental right to abortion while supporting some restrictions. The court was shorthanded with only eight justices following the Feb. 13 death of conservative Antonin Scalia, leaving the liberals and conservatives evenly divided. The best that supporters of the law could hope for would be a 4-4 split that would let stand a lower-court ruling that affirmed the Texas regulations but set no nationwide legal precedent on whether other states could enact similar measures. However, a such ruling leaving the Texas law intact could encourage other states with anti-abortion legislatures to pass similar laws. Kennedy gave little indication he would be willing to uphold the law in full, as his three conservative colleagues would be expected to do. If Kennedy sides with the courts four liberals, the court could either send the case back to the lower court or strike it down. A ruling is due by the end of June. A decision sending the case to a lower court could mean the dispute might not be resolved for years.  Some justices questioned the lack of evidence on why specific clinics closed after the law was passed, which could be addressed if new legal proceedings take place. Abortion providers assert that the law caused 22 of 41 clinics to close, but the state contests those numbers. What is the evidence in the record that the closures are related to the legislation? conservative Chief Justice John Roberts asked. Texas contends the law, passed by a Republican-controlled legislature and signed by a Republican governor, protects womens health. The abortion providers who have challenged it assert that the regulations are aimed at shutting down their clinics. In a sign that he was not comfortable with aspects of the law, Kennedy sounded concerned about a possible increase in surgical abortions prompted in part by the states separate new restrictions on medically induced abortions, in which women take pills to terminate a pregnancy. Kennedy said that this law has really increased the number of surgical procedures as opposed to medical procedures, and that this may not be medically wise. Abortion rights advocates say surgical abortions increased because of the delays women seeking an abortion faced as a result of the 2013 law. Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg questioned the need for a provision of the law requiring clinics to have costly, hospital-grade facilities, when abortions almost always are low-risk procedures for the woman. What was the problem the legislature was responding to that it needed to improve the facilities for womens health? Ginsburg asked. The Texas law requires abortion doctors to have admitting privileges, a type of formal affiliation, at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic. Abortion providers say the provision already has forced clinics to close because such an affiliation is hard to obtain. The abortion providers also challenged a provision, not yet in effect, requiring clinics to have hospital-grade facilities with standards for corridor width, plumbing, parking spaces, room size, the spacing of beds and many other attributes. Conservative Justice Samuel Alito indicated support for the regulations and referred to evidence that abortion facilities in Texas have been cited for really appalling violations when they were inspected: holes in the floor where rats could come in, the lack of any equipment to adequately sterilize instruments. The Supreme Courts last major abortion ruling came in 2007 when it upheld a federal law banning a late-term abortion procedure. The Supreme Court legalized abortion in the 1973 Roe v. Wade case. But abortion remains a disputed issue in the United States, as it does in many countries, and some states have passed laws aiming to place a variety of restrictions on a womans ability to terminate a pregnancy. The court is considering the Texas case in the midst of the heated campaign ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. ",politicsNews,"March 2, 2016 ",1
"After primary win, Senate Banking chair may move some nominees","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, fresh off his primary victory in Alabama, signaled on Wednesday that he may soon end his moratorium on some of the 16 Obama administration financial nominees awaiting panel confirmation. The stalled nominees include those for two Federal Reserve Board governors, two Securities and Exchange commissioners, a U.S. Export-Import Bank board member needed to approve large financing deals and the U.S. Treasurys top anti-terrorist finance official.     Banking Committee Democrats and some policy analysts had speculated that Shelby, 81, might be more willing to break the logjam once he defeated a 33-year-old Tea Party-backed primary challenger who had tried to make an issue of his age and long tenure in Washington.  Shelby returned to Washington for a Senate vote on Wednesday afternoon, but Reuters could not reach him in the Capitol. His spokeswoman, Torrie Matous, said that the five-term senator now intends to address a number of issues throughout the year including some nominations. She added that he would likely begin announcing some hearing plans next week. In Alabama on Tuesday, Shelby easily defeated four challengers to take 65 percent of the vote, enough to avoid a runoff election in April. In a campaign atmosphere dominated by Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trumps anti-establishment message, Shelby did the opposite, running on his experience and emphasizing his power base in Washington, D.C.  Earlier this week, Democrats on the Banking Committee urged Shelby to stop obstructing the nominations. One of the most acute problems is for the Export-Import Bank, which cannot approve loans or guarantees above $10 million without Senate confirmation of a third board member effectively locking it out of deals for Boeing commercial aircraft or major power equipment made by General Electric Conservatives, including Shelby, had waged a major campaign to close the trade bank last year, idling it for more than five months before Congress voted to renew its charter. The Fed nominees, former community banker Allan Landon and University of Michigan economist Kathryn Dominguez, would restore the central banks board to its full capacity of seven members.  Many had written off their chances of being confirmed, in part because of the testy relationship between Congress and the Fed, which has opposed Republican bills it says would curb its independence. Shelby had previously said that he would not move the 16 nominees until the Obama administration named a Fed vice chair for supervision, a position created by the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.

Emotions run high outside courthouse for abortion showdown,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Emotions over abortion simmered on the sidewalks outside the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday, with hundreds of activists on both sides of the issue staging dueling rallies and anti-abortion lawmakers joining the fray. If you support life, let me hear you scream, South Carolina Republican U.S. Senator Tim Scott told anti-abortion demonstrators, eliciting yells and applause.We are talking about 10 fingers and 10 toes and one precious heart. We are here for the right reasons. The court heard arguments in a legal challenge to a restrictive, Republican-backed Texas abortion law, with a ruling expected by the end of June. It was the latest flashpoint in Americas culture wars. Christina Bennett, a member of the National Black Pro-Life Coalition, shared her story during the anti-abortion rally about how her mother made a last-minute decision not to abort her. Im so grateful for my life and I love my life, Bennett said, defending the Texas law at issue in the case that imposes regulations on abortion doctors and clinic buildings, rules that supporters of the measure state are intended to protect womens health. Anti-abortion protesters held large posters with photos of aborted fetuses and signs that read, Protect women, protect life. One young woman clutched rosary beads in her hands and had red tape over her mouth with the word life written on it. Republican U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan addressed the anti-abortion rally, but was barely audible over screams from abortion rights protesters shouting, Stop the sham! Abortion rights advocates contend the Texas law is not aimed at protecting womens health but rather at imposing burdensome regulations that would force abortion clinics to close. Demonstrator Hannah Friedman, a George Washington University student, held up a coat hanger with #WeWontGoBack scribbled across the front, a reference to how unsafe abortions were performed before the Supreme Court legalized abortion nationwide in 1973. I think its really important to speak against the pro-life rhetoric going on behind me, with people using the Bible to defend their own personal beliefs and then inflict those beliefs upon me and my life and my decisions, Friedman added. This has been one of the most challenging, difficult and intense years of our lives, Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder of Whole Womans Health, one of the abortion providers that challenged the law, told supporters. After all, we have nothing to hide and we stand in the light. ",politicsNews,"March 2, 2016 ",1
Oregon governor signs tiered minimum wage measure into law,"PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - Earnings for minimum-wage workers in Portland, Oregon will rise by $5.50 an hour over the next six years, with lesser increases set for smaller towns and rural areas under a first-of-its-kind measure signed into law on Wednesday by Oregons governor. Oregon has been in the vanguard of a growing number of U.S. states and cities that have moved in recent years to bolster the federal minimum wage, which has remained at $7.25 an hour since 2009. The latest measure builds on a current Oregon wage floor that already stands at $9.25 an hour statewide under a law enacted in 2002. Supporters say such measures are necessary to help low-paid workers who have been slipping into poverty due to stagnant earnings and rising living expenses. Opponents say raising the mandatory wage floor puts an undue strain on businesses still struggling to rebound from a prolonged U.S. economic slump. The bill passed by Oregons Democratic-led legislature and signed by Governor Kate Brown, also a Democrat, seeks to strike a balance by setting different pay tiers based on geography. Starting July 1, the minimum wage for Oregon workers statewide will climb by 50 cents an hour, with graduated increases set at higher rates for the states biggest city, Portland, as compared to smaller municipalities and rural communities where the cost of living is generally lower. By 2022 under the new statute the hourly minimum wage will rise to $14.75 in Portland, to $13.50 in smaller cities and towns, and to $12.50 in rural areas. It means just an extra $15 or $20 a month starting in July, but for a mom of three just that small amount makes a big difference, Brown said in signing the measure. She said the gradual, differentiated pay hikes would ensure that businesses have time to plan for the increase. Thats the Oregon way. U.S. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez hailed Oregons approach, adjusting the wage floor according to regional economic differences, as a model for other states to follow until Congress passes a higher national minimum wage supported by President Barack Obama. A Democratic-backed proposal to raise the federal minimum to $10.10 stalled on Capitol Hill in 2014. More recent proposals by some lawmakers call for a federal minimum wage of up to $15 an hour. Oregon Republicans who opposed the increase predicted it would cost businesses in the state $1.2 billion. ",politicsNews,"March 2, 2016 ",1
Appellate judge Kelly considered for Supreme Court: NYT,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is vetting federal appellate Judge Jane Kelly for a possible U.S. Supreme Court nomination to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, the New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing a person with knowledge of the process. The FBI has been conducting background interviews on Kelly, the Times said, citing the unnamed source. Scalia, a long-serving conservative justice, died on Feb. 13. The White House declined to comment on the report. Kelly, a white woman and former public defender, has served on the St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals since April 2013. She was confirmed to the post by the Senate on a 96-0 vote.  She had been mentioned by legal experts as a potential nominee in part because her earlier nomination to the appeals court was supported by Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee that would review any Supreme Court nomination. Grassley said at the time that Kelly was well regarded in my home state of Iowa and that he was pleased to support her nomination.  Kelly, 51, served as a clerk for now-retired Judge David Hansen, a friend of Grassley who served on the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Republican leaders have so far rebuffed President Barack Obamas appeal to hold confirmation hearings and a vote on a nominee, including in a face-to-face meeting on Tuesday at the White House that failed to budge them from their vow to block anyone he offers for the job. Republicans say the decision on who to nominate should be left to the next president, who takes office next January after the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Republicans hope to win back the White House then. Under the U.S. Constitution, the president nominates Supreme Court justices and the Senate must confirm them. Without Scalia, the court has four conservative and four liberal justices, meaning any potential Obama nominee could tip the court to the left for the first time in decades. Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval, a moderate Republican, took himself out of consideration for appointment to the Supreme Court last week, a day after his name surfaced in connection with the Scalia vacancy.

"Christie slammed on social media, New Jersey press urges resignation","NEW YORK (Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie took a drubbing on social media for his demeanor in an appearance with Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump at a televised victory speech and news conference on Super Tuesday. Adding to his woes, six New Jersey newspapers called on Christie to resign, partly for endorsing Trump after dropping out of the race to become the Republican Partys candidate in Novembers election. A Christie spokesman, Brian Murray, declined to comment immediately on the editorial, which appeared in newspapers owned by Gannett Co Inc (GCI.N). Christie surprisingly endorsed Trump on Friday, calling the billionaire New York businessman the best person to beat Hillary Clinton in November. Some questioned whether Christies enthusiasm was genuine following his appearance at Trumps event in Palm Beach, Florida on Tuesday night. Trump appeared before TV cameras after news media organizations declared him the winner of some of the state-by-state primaries and caucuses and as Super Tuesday results continued rolling in. Christie introduced Trump, then stood behind and just to the right of the brash billionaire. The governor stared blankly ahead, at times looking troubled, as Trump took reporters questions. The reaction to Christies demeanor was swift and unforgiving on social media. This is what a man collapsing under the weight of his own shame looks like, Sean D. Illing (@sean_illing) tweeted on Tuesday. Did #ChrisChristie look pathetic standing behind #Trump, or what?!?  Karen Walz (@khwalz) tweeted on Wednesday. News website BuzzFeed on Tuesday evening tweeted a clip of the video footage set to the classic Simon and Garfunkel song Sounds of Silence, with the caption Hello darkness, my old friend, a lyric from the song. Christie spokesman Murray would not comment on the social media reaction, saying in an email, Ill let you know when we opt to slide down into that muck.    In the editorial calling on Christie to resign, the six newspapers, including the Asbury Park Press, called his endorsement hypocritical. Were disgusted with (Christies) endorsement of Donald Trump after he spent months on the campaign trail trashing him, calling him unqualified by temperament and experience to be president, the editorial read. Christie, serving the second of two four-year terms, is not slated to leave office until December 2017.

Factbox: The race to the U.S. presidential nominations: How delegates are selected ,"(Reuters) - The Democratic and Republican nominees for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election are decided in a series of state-by-state contests. The key to winning the nomination for each party is ultimately not about the popular vote, but about securing the number of delegates needed to win the nomination at each partys convention - July 18-21 in Cleveland for the Republicans and July 25-28 in Philadelphia for the Democrats. The following is a guide to the nominating process: Q: Is the delegate selection process the same for the Republican and Democratic parties? A: No. The parties set their own rules. One thing that is the same is that at each party convention, a candidate needs to reach only a simple majority of the delegate votes to win the nomination. Q: How many delegates are there? A: The Democratic convention will be attended by about 4,763 delegates, with 2,382 delegates needed to win the nomination. The Republican convention will be attended by 2,472 delegates, with 1,237 delegates needed to win. Q: I keep hearing about superdelegates. Are they different from other delegates? Do both the Republicans and Democrats have superdelegates? A: Superdelegates, officially known as unpledged delegates, are a sort of wild card in the nominating process, but only the Democrats have them. The category was created for the 1984 Democratic convention, and according to political scientists, they are a legacy of the 1980 convention when there was a fight for the nomination between President Jimmy Carter, who was seeking a second term in the White House, and Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts. Members of Congress were frustrated by their lack of influence, because delegates elected to support one candidate could not switch to support another. So Democratic members of the House of Representatives led an effort to win a role for themselves. That resulted in the creation of superdelegates. Unlike other delegates, superdelegates may change what candidate they are supporting right up to the convention. There is no fixed number of superdelegates because the group is defined by various categories whose members change from one election cycle to another. Here is who gets to be a superdelegate:  All Democratic members of the House of Representatives and the Senate; the Democratic governors; the Democratic president and vice president of the United States; former Democratic presidents and vice presidents; former Democratic leaders of the U.S. Senate; former Democratic speakers of the House and former Democratic minority leaders. Throw in the members of the Democratic National Committee and the former chairs of the DNC and you finally have the whole pool of superdelegates. Q: What about the other delegates? Do they get to choose which candidate to support? A: Both the Democratic and Republican parties send delegates to their conventions based on the popular vote in the primary elections and caucuses held in each of the 50 states. But the parties have different rules on how delegates are allotted to a candidate. The Democratic Party applies uniform rules to all states. In each state, delegates are allocated in proportion to the percentage of the primary or caucus vote in each district. But a candidate must win at least 15 percent of the vote to be allocated any delegates. The Republican Party lets states determine their own rules, although it does dictate some things. Some states award delegates proportionate to the popular vote, although most such states have a minimum percentage that a candidate must reach to win any delegates. Some other states use the winner-take-all method, in which the candidate with the highest percentage of the popular vote is awarded all the delegates. Other states use a combination of the two methods. States that use the proportionate method may instead use the winner-take-all method if one candidate wins more than 50 percent of the popular vote.  In addition, the Republican Party requires that all states with nominating contests held between March 1 and March 14 use the proportional method, meaning that all the states holding votes on Super Tuesday will have to award delegates proportionally.  Q: What happens to delegates if a candidate drops out of the race? A: Another good question, because we have certainly seen that happen this year. For the Democratic Party, in every state, delegates are reallocated to the remaining candidates. For the Republican Party, it varies by state. In some states, delegates are required to stick with their original candidate at least through the first ballot at the Republican National Convention. In some other states, if a candidate drops out, his or her delegates may immediately pledge to another candidate. There is also a middle ground in which those delegates are reallocated to the remaining candidates.

U.S. 'very concerned' by media crackdown in Malaysia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday voiced concern about Malaysias media crackdown and suggested that the extent of press and Internet freedom in the Asian country could affect prospects for expanded bilateral cooperation. U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby said Washington was very concerned by Malaysias recent restrictions of access to reporting on its domestic current affairs, including last weeks blocking of access to The Malaysian Insider, a news portal. The Malaysian Insider has published reports on the scandal around 1Malaysia Development Berhad and investigations into $681 million deposited into Prime Minister Najibs personal accounts. The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission said the news portal had breached laws under the Communications and Multimedia Act, a 1998 law that bars using a website to publish any comment, request, suggestion or other communication which is obscene, indecent, false, menacing or offensive in character with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass another person. Najib has denied any wrongdoing over the money transferred into his account, saying that the funds were a political donation and that nothing was taken for his personal gain. The United States is also troubled that the government has failed to provide due process to targeted media groups before blocking access and has begun criminal investigations of  reporters, editors and publishers, Kirby said. Of equal concern, many Malaysian social media users face charges for postings critical of the government and national leaders, he added, saying Malaysian officials have spoken about legal amendments that would further restrict online space. He said the United States hoped to expand our cooperation with Malaysia on shared challenges, adding in that context, we urge the Government of Malaysia to ensure that all its laws, existing and future, fully respect freedom of expression, including the free flow of ideas on the internet.

"Cruz gains in online betting, Trump still Republican favorite","(Reuters) - Ted Cruzs Super Tuesday victories in his home state of Texas and neighboring Oklahoma strengthened his odds for the Republican presidential nomination on online betting sites but he still trails far behind Donald Trump. On PredictIt.com, operated by Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, the predicted chances of the Texas senator winning the nomination for the Nov. 8 election rose to 10 percent as results from Super Tuesday voting continued to be tallied. Cruz has gained 4 percentage points in the past two days and his predicted chances stood at the highest level on the site since he tumbled to a record low after a weak showing in the South Carolina primary on Feb 20. But Trump, who rolled to wins in at least seven states on Super Tuesday, was outdistancing both Cruz and his other top rival, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. PredictIt had Trumps odds of winning the nomination at 76 percent early on Wednesday, down 4 points from Mondays record high of 80 percent. Rubio, who scored his first win in a nominating contest on Tuesday with the Minnesota Republican caucuses, dropped 1 point to 10 percent, a record low for him. Betting volumes on both Trump and Cruz hit records for the candidates on Tuesday and Rubios volume was his second highest ever. Other online betting venues also gave Trump, a New York billionaire businessman, the strongest odds of winning the nomination. Irelands PaddyPower put Trump as a 1-to-7 favorite, with Rubio following at 5-1 and Cruz at 12-1. Ladbrokes PLC said on Wednesday morning that Trumps odds of securing the nomination were 1-5. Rubio came in a distant second at 9-2, followed by Cruz at 25-1. Message boards associated with PredictIt featured growing discussion of a possible brokered convention, which can occur when no candidate has won a clear majority of delegates before the start of the partys nominating convention. There has not been a brokered U.S. major-party convention since 1952 when the Democrats nominated Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson on the third ballot. I am betting against Trump getting the nomination at these odds but only because I think there is a 30 percent chance the GOP elite somehow successfully blocks him at the convention, said a post from a forum member with the username matthewcooley.

Trump a 'monster' spawned by Republicans: Senate Democratic leader,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republicans have only themselves to blame for Donald Trump, a monster spawned by their constant partisan opposition to all major Obama administration initiatives, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said on Wednesday. Republicans created him (Trump) by spending seven years appealing to some of the darkest forces in America, said Reid. He spoke on the floor of the U.S. Senate a day after presidential candidate Trump won a string of primary contests and consolidated his status as front-runner to be the Republican  nominee in the November election. Trumps rise has alarmed many establishment Republicans, who are both critical of his positions and skeptical he can win the White House. Reid, known for occasionally delivering controversial statements on the Senate floor, said Trump was now the Republican standard-bearer, but he could destroy the party. The reality is that Republican leaders are reaping what theyve sown, Reid said, recounting seven years worth of staunch Republican opposition to Obamas initiatives. Republicans had decided from the start of Obamas presidency in 2009 that he was an illegitimate president, said Reid, who is retiring at the end of this year.  Democrat Obama, the first African-American president, is in the final year of his second four-year term. His presidency has been marked by bitter battles with Republicans over fiscal affairs, a landmark law to expand healthcare coverage for the uninsured, immigration, banking reform and policies to tackle climate change. Republicans have controlled the House of Representatives since 2011. And while they took control of the Senate in 2015, they previously used their minority status deftly to challenge Obama. Some Republicans, such as Senator Lindsey Graham, have been outspoken in their opposition to Trump as the prospective party nominee, saying the New York billionaire s inflammatory rhetoric will lead to defeat in the general election. Nonetheless, Trump, 69, now looks near unstoppable to be the Republican running against the eventual Democratic presidential candidate - most likely Hillary Clinton. Among Trumps more controversial proposals have been his call for a wall along the entire southwestern U.S. border to keep out Mexican immigrants. When Congress was attempting to pass a comprehensive immigration bill in 2013 and 2014, many Republican lawmakers put the brakes on the measure, instead calling for tough border enforcement only.  Now its time for Republicans to undo what theyve done by denouncing Donald Trump, Reid said. Trump is the GOPs Frankenstein monster. If the Republicans fail to stop Donald Trump, hell tear the party apart even more than it is now.

Winning Democrat nomination needs voter coalition: Clinton campaign,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The campaign of Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton on Wednesday called support from a broad coalition of voters - including people of color, women and union households - critical for anyone hoping to secure the partys nomination for the November 2016 election and beyond. Robby Mook, Clintons campaign manager, noted support for the former secretary of state among African Americans, Latinos and Asian American Pacific Islanders, women and union households in a memo sent out by the campaign.  He also noted that Clinton won white voters in the nominating contests for several states on Super Tuesday, the previous day, in which Clinton won seven states to the four states captured by her rival, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. It is also important to note that these constituencies are not only critical to winning the Democratic nomination but will also be central to how a Democrat wins in November, and a candidate that starts with a deep base of support will have an advantage in the general election, Mook wrote.

Mexico to counter negative tone of U.S. presidential race,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexicos government is planning a diplomatic push to counter aggressive rhetoric against its nationals in the U.S. election race, a senior official said on Tuesday, after calls by Donald Trump for a massive wall to divide the two nations. Republican presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have also proposed building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, but it is Trump who has taken the hardest line against the United States southern neighbor. The Republican front-runner has labeled Mexican migrants as drug runners and rapists, proposed mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and said Mexico is killing the United States with cheap labor. Francisco Guzman, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nietos chief of staff, on Tuesday said it was time for the government to push back against these negative images. Mexico plans to use its extensive network of U.S. consulates to highlight the benefits of U.S.-Mexican relations to the U.S. economy and the American people, Guzman said.   The initiative will include forums with U.S. business people, politicians and public figures to get Mexicos opinions heard. Mexicos positioning in the U.S. election debate is not generally adequate, Guzman told a group of foreign correspondents. It doesnt reflect the constructive relationship between Mexico and the U.S. Trump rolled up a series of primary wins on Tuesday and looked set to take command of the Republican nomination battle.   The Mexican government has up till now avoided a direct confrontation with the billionaire real estate developer, though the countrys top diplomat has called his policies and comments ignorant and racist. Former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderon have publicly condemned Trump, both comparing him to Adolf Hitler.  Were not going to involve ourselves in the (U.S. presidential) debate. We dont want to polarize, but we do want to have a positive institutional relationship as weve had in the past, Guzman said. The U.S.-Mexico relationship requires more bridges and fewer walls. The isolationist solution is not a solution at all, he added.  The United States is Mexicos top trade partner, the destination for about 80 percent of its exports, in addition to sharing many cultural and family links. To promote stronger ties, Mexicos government plans to meet with the final contenders for the White House once the two major parties have selected their candidates, Guzman said. Any candidate, above all if he wants to project himself forward, has to, in my opinion, see the relationship with Mexico not as a threat but as an opportunity, he said.

Reeling Republican establishment running out of time to stop Trump,"MIAMI (Reuters) - When Senator Ted Cruz took the stage on Tuesday after winning the Republican nominating contest in his home state of Texas, he issued a call for the party to rally behind his presidential candidacy. That seems a long shot. Republican Party leaders came away from Super Tuesday - the 2016 presidential campaigns biggest day of state-by-state nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election - without any clearer consensus about how to slow front-runner Donald Trumps march to the nomination. They fear Trumps divisive rhetoric - which includes calls to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, deport 11 million illegal immigrants and temporarily bar Muslims from entering the country - will tarnish the partys image and ensure Democrats hold on to the White House and possibly retake the Senate. The billionaire businessman won the largest number of Super Tuesday contests, taking seven states, but fell short of the 10 states some polls had predicted. Cruz won two, and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida notched his first win, in Minnesota. That made Cruz and Rubio unlikely to withdraw from the race before the next big nominating contest in two weeks. The same goes for Ohio Governor John Kasich, who has said he will continue his candidacy through his states primary on March 15. So long as the field remains divided, Donald Trumps path to the nomination remains more likely, and that would be a disaster for Republicans, for conservatives and for the nation, Cruz said. Trumps failure to win a clean sweep of the primary contests on Tuesday buys the establishment wing of the party time to intensify its counterattacks against the New York real estate mogul and political outsider. While they have yet to coalesce around a single strategy, anti-Trump Republicans have begun taking action.   Club for Growth, a conservative advocacy group, claimed credit for slowing Trump in some primary states by running attack ads. Donald Trump can be stopped, said the groups president, David McIntosh, in a statement. And he must be, before he costs conservatives the White House, the Senate, and the Supreme Court. The New York Times reported that several financial backers of the Republican Party organized a phone call on Tuesday to get funding for an anti-Trump effort. Helping lead the call were the hedge-fund manager Paul Singer, Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts, and Meg Whitman, the Hewlett-Packard Enterprise chief executive. The newspaper said it was unclear what kind of political offensive might emerge from those discussions. A recently launched political action committee dedicated to blasting Trump, Our Principles PAC, said it was ramping up fundraising and planned daily attacks against Trump before upcoming primaries in March. It said the campaign would focus on Trumps business record and include a video where he declined in an interview to disavow former Ku Klux Klan official David Duke. Trump, who later rejected Dukes support, said he had not clearly heard the interviewers question. On Capitol Hill, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who will preside over the partys nominating convention in July, made clear he disapproved of Trumps rhetoric in comments that suggested he was not ready to welcome Trump into the establishment fold. If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party, there must be no evasion and no games. They must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry, Ryan, the partys 2012 vice presidential nominee, told reporters. Trump ratcheted up the tension during a news conference in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday night, warning Ryan he would pay a big price if he stood in Trumps way.  Despite the establishments distaste for Trump, there appears to be no consensus on the best way to stop him. As long as both Cruz, Rubio and Kasich remain in the race, then Trump will continue to prevail in upcoming primary states and he will vacuum up the delegates while the vote splits among the remaining candidates, said Ron Bonjean, a Republican operative in Washington. Rubio and Kasich have set their sights on delegate-rich contests in the heavily populated states of Michigan, Florida, Ohio and Illinois later this month. More than 1,200 delegates are required by the party to secure its nomination.  The goal for the remaining campaigns will be to keep Trump from amassing those delegates for as long as possible, with the hope that an increasing tide of criticism from the candidates, party leaders and political action committees will drain his support.  But Bonjean said the party would have to find a way to thwart Trump before he walked away with the nomination. The odds of stopping Trump are getting much lower with every state put away into his corner, he said.   (Editing by Peter Cooney) This article was funded in part by SAP.

How the Republican elite turned a blind eye to the rise and rise of Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One evening last June, some of the Republican Partys wealthiest donors gathered for a cocktail party at an exclusive resort in Deer Valley, Utah, during a three-day retreat hosted by former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.  They had just heard from six presidential hopefuls. Tom Duncan, the CEO of tool-maker Positec Tool Corp, chatted with a few attendees about a fantasy ticket to secure the White House in November 2016: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, with Senator Marco Rubio of Florida as his running mate. Duncan, for his part, liked Ohio Governor John Kasich, but also had his eye on former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. No one mentioned Donald Trump, even though he had been signaling for months that he planned to run. Four days later, the New York property magnate declared his candidacy and within weeks had shot to the top of the polls, eclipsing all of his Republican rivals. The story of Trumps rise has played out day after day on television and on social media, but the conversations behind closed doors among members of the Republican elite during this period have been less well documented. Many of the conversations had one thing in common: a stubborn refusal to take Trump seriously, even as fans packed sports stadiums to see him in the summer months, as he dominated media coverage of the election, and as polls showed him winning wide support among young and old, men and women.   Scenes like the one at Deer Valley would be repeated in rarified enclaves of the party elite around the country again and again in the coming months. Many in the Republican establishment believed he would eventually self-destruct or that Americans would lose patience with his bombast, his free-wheeling insults and lack of firm policies to back up his promises to Make America Great Again. They were wrong. Trump won a majority of the states holding nominating contests on Super Tuesday, accelerating his march to the Republican nomination.  Republican donors, strategists and campaign operatives interviewed by Reuters admitted they had misjudged the mood of voters who have thrown their support behind Trump after he promised to build a wall on the Mexican border, temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States and block Syrian refugees because they might be militants.  Trumps spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, declined to comment for this story. Trumps rise seemed to take place entirely outside the structures of the normal nomination process within the Republican party. For example, many attending the Conservative Political Action Conference, a gathering of grassroots activists, in February 2015, were excited by presidential hopefuls Wisconsin governor Walker and Texas Senator Ted Cruz. The annual convention is a must-stop for any Republican White House contender. In his speech, Trump tried out a now familiar pledge: build a giant southern wall to stop illegal immigrants, a vow that would later ignite his insurgent campaign and propel him well ahead of the main pack of Republican presidential hopefuls.  His speech was well-received, but he didnt do that well in the straw poll, said Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, which organizes CPAC each year. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul won the poll. CPACs attendees were mostly conservative political activists already engaged in the electoral process. The fans who would drive Trumps success were not. The candidates favored at CPAC have languished. Walker left the race just two months after officially entering it. Paul dropped out after the first nominating contest in February. Cruz has won just three of more than a dozen contests so far. Early in his run, Trump was a source of puzzlement for rich Republicans, such as those who gathered one Sunday in early August in the Hamptons, New Yorks gilded summer retreat destination, to discuss the 2016 race. They met for lunch at a billionaire hedge fund managers estate near a body of water nicknamed Goldman pond for the concentration of financiers houses around it. Among the guests were former defense department officials, the chief executive of a big real estate firm, a prominent private equity partner and conservative academics, according to one of the guests, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The source, like many other guests, backed former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.  A variety of subjects were discussed, but chief among them, I would say, was the concern and consternation over the candidacy of Donald Trump, the source said. At the time, Trumps rating in national polls was twice his closet rivals, according to Reuters/Ipsos data.  The attendees discussed Trumps rise and observed he had struck a chord with many Americans, the source said. They fretted over whether his presence would force other candidates to go negative. They hoped he wouldnt hijack the first Republican presidential debate, then less than a week away. But they decided, however it had begun, Trumps reign atop the polls wouldnt last. I think its literally just a matter of time before his NASCAR careens into the wall  and hopefully not into the other drivers, the source said in an interview on Aug. 6. Trump has not crashed. And on Monday, the CEO of NASCAR, Brian France, endorsed him. Right to Rise, the outside spending group backing Bush, built up a massive war chest of more than $100 million to attack opponents who could thwart his bid for the nomination. Trump was not identified as a potential threat, not in the summer, nor in the fall of 2015, even as he eclipsed Bush, according to multiple interviews during that period with a member of the groups leadership team. I dont think hes hurting us, the official, who did not want to be identified, said in an interview last fall. Trump would be a footnote in the race by January or February 2016, he predicted.  Bush bowed out on Feb. 21 after months of struggles were capped by a poor showing in the South Carolina primary. Duncan, the Positec CEO, said conversations he had with representatives from three campaigns as recently as November and December barely touched on Trump.  There was so much time left, he said. I honestly thought that he would implode.  Now there is little time left, and the partys establishment can only look back at early warning signs they missed. One came in January 2015 at the Iowa Freedom Summit,a Republican cattle call for White House hopefuls that marked the unofficial start of the 2016 presidential race. Attendance spiked after organizers added Trump to the agenda.  When we announced Donald Trump, the event took on a life of its own, said David Bossie, the president of the conservative advocacy group Citizens United and the conferences organizer. I dont believe its possible, if you were not in a coma, for anyone in the establishment, or the media, or on planet Earth, to have missed Donald Trumps ascendancy to be the leading Republican for the nomination.

"Factbox: Build a giant wall, cut Education Department. What a President Trump would do","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who scored a major victory in a series of Super Tuesday nominating contests, has been criticized by some in his party for being vague on policy specifics and heavy on rhetoric. Here is a closer look at what Trump has said he would do on trade, taxes, the economy, immigration, healthcare and defense should he become the nominee and win the Nov. 8 election. The policies are drawn from a review of his website, stump speeches, debates and town halls, and televised interviews. Trump has complained that China, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam and India are ripping us off by devaluing their currencies and keeping out some U.S. exports. He would not sign the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact and would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada. He would designate China a currency manipulator and impose countervailing duties on its exports. He also wants to pursue a World Trade Organization case on Chinese government programs that subsidize exporters. Trump has said he would put activist investor Carl Icahn in charge of negotiating a better trade relationship with China. Icahn has said he is happy to advise Trump, but would not seek a formal position if Trump were elected. Trump has said he would slap 35 percent tariffs on air conditioners made by United Technologies Corps Carrier in Mexico after the company decided to move production there from Indiana, and on Ford Motor Corp vehicles made in Mexico that are sold in the United States. Trump has pledged to cut and simplify taxes. Individuals making less than $25,000 per year and married filers earning less than $50,000 would not pay income tax. There would be three other brackets, down from seven currently, with a top marginal income tax rate of 25 percent, and a top rate for long-term capital gains and dividends of 20 percent. Charitable giving and mortgage interest deductions would remain unchanged. Other deductions would be trimmed in the highest tax brackets. He would eliminate the alternative minimum tax, the estate tax, and the carried interest tax break that allows investment fund managers to treat income as capital gains. The corporate tax rate would be cut to 15 percent, down from the current level of 35 percent. He would phase in a reasonable cap on deductions for business interest expenses and would cut other corporate loopholes. Trump would impose a one-time 10 percent deemed repatriation tax on deferred corporate overseas profits and would end deferral of income from foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Foundation, an independent policy research group, has said Trumps plan would cost more than $10 trillion over the next decade. His campaign has said the plan is fully paid for. Trump has pledged to get rid of the $19 trillion deficit by boosting jobs, and cutting government waste, but he has not released a formal policy paper on how he would do this. He has said he would not cut the Medicare and Medicaid health care programs for senior citizens and low income Americans, nor Social Security retirement benefits. He would cut the Education Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump has promised to build a high wall at the southern border to keep out illegal immigrants that he has said would cost $10 billion to $12 billion. Mexico would pay for the wall or face consequences, his campaign said. Trump would impound remittance payments to Mexico from undocumented workers, and increase visa and border crossing fees for Mexican workers. Applying tariffs on Mexican goods and cutting foreign aid are also options, his campaign has said on his website. He would deport the 11 million undocumented people living in America and end birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to illegal immigrants. He has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and would not allow refugees from Syria. Trump would triple the number of border agents and require all businesses to use the E-Verify database to ensure employees are in the country legally. He would withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities that decline to help the federal government deport illegal immigrants. Trumps campaign has also said he would pause new green cards and require employers to hire American workers first. Trump has said he would repeal the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, and replace it with a system of health savings accounts. He would still require insurers to provide coverage to people with preexisting medical conditions, a key feature of Obamacare. He would move to allow insurance companies to sell plans across state lines to spur competition. Trump has said he could save the government $300 billion by negotiating better prices with drug companies. Trump has promised to knock out Islamic State quickly and said he is open to working with Russia to do so. He has said he would bomb the oil that helps finance the insurgent group and stop the back channels of banking used by the group. He has vowed to bring back the use of waterboarding, an interrogation technique that simulates drowning and has been banned as torture under U.S. law. He said he also supports other, unspecified techniques a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding. He would take out the family members of Islamic State militants and would like to shut down areas of the Internet to try to stop the group from recruiting members. He wants to build a safe zone for Syrian refugees in Syria. But Gulf states would have to pay for it. He has said the United States should first deal with Islamic State before addressing President Bashar al-Assads future, saying We have to do one thing at a time. He has questioned whether the United States should back opposition groups in Syria, saying we have no idea who they are. Trump has said he would increase the size and power of the U.S. military to make it so strong, so powerful that nobodys going to mess with us. He says too much money is wasted buying equipment the military does not want. He wants Japan, Germany, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to bear more of the cost of military aid provided by the United States. We can no longer defend all of these countries, he said, citing the deficit. Trump would boost the U.S. military presence in the East and South China seas to discourage Chinese adventurism, according to his website. ",politicsNews,"March 2, 2016 ",1
"Gaining momentum on Super Tuesday, Clinton takes aim at Trump","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Gathering speed toward winning the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton did not wait long after a streak of wins on Super Tuesday to gird for battle with Republican front-runner Donald Trump. The former first lady won 7 of 11 states up for grabs on Tuesday, sweeping the South and creating more distance between her and rival Bernie Sanders in the race to represent the Democratic Party at the Nov. 8 election for the White House. The wins, which include the heavily populated state of Texas, mean she can turn an eye toward billionaire reality TV star Trump, who also won heavily on Tuesday.  In another good sign for Clinton, her fundraisers say donors are eager to fund her campaign into the general election. Hillary will be the nominee, and now she needs to start focusing on taking on Trump, said Dane Strother, an unaligned Washington DC-based Democratic strategist.  On Tuesday night, Clinton took aim at Trumps reputation for spewing insults at his opponents, and repeated an attack on the real estate moguls proposal to build a 1,000-mile wall along the border with Mexico. The stakes in this election have never been higher and the rhetoric were hearing on the other side has never been lower, she said during a rally in Miami after she won in several states.  Trying to divide America between us and them is wrong.     Clintons wins give her 527 delegates to the Democratic nominating convention, to Sanders 325, according to a New York Times delegate count early on Wednesday. A Democratic candidate needs 2,383 delegates to win. Jim Manley, a Washington-based Democratic strategist who supports Clinton, said her move to swiftly target Trump was necessary but potentially dangerous for her. She has to start looking toward the general election, but its not without its risks, he said. He said Trump would strike back: Hell go right in the gutter. Trump has frequently criticized Clintons handling of crises like Iraq and Syria during her four years as secretary of state, and suggested he will dredge up old scandals involving former President Bill Clinton.          Some Clinton fundraisers said the campaign is noticing renewed interest among donors to support her beyond primary season. Her campaign, they add, appears more open to accepting that cash, an indication they believe she will win the nomination. I think they are taking a shift towards the general (election), said Tom Sacks-Wilner, a member of Clintons national finance committee. The finance departments not objecting to it at this point, he said. Campaign donors are allowed to give $2,700 to an individual candidate for the primary phase of an election, and another $2,700 for the general phase, for a grand total of $5,400. Another Clinton fundraiser, in Los Angeles, said that he has had more donors in his area ask him about giving money for the fight beyond California, and he added that the recent victories also make it easier to bring in campaign volunteers. The upbeat attitude marks a shift from three weeks ago, when Clintons campaign was bruised by Sanders resounding win in New Hampshire, and a close second place finish in Iowa, where he carried a large proportion of the youth vote. The shift became more pronounced last week after Clintons victory in South Carolina, where she enjoyed broad support among African-American voters - a bloc Sanders has struggled to draw with his democratic socialist platform. Nationally, support for Clinton has increased since just before the Feb. 27 South Carolina primary. Nearly 53 percent of Democrats said theyd vote for Clinton, compared with 43 percent for the U.S. Senator from Vermont,  according to the Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll from Feb. 26 to March 1. They were in a dead heat earlier in the month. Sanders has also worked to position himself as a general election candidate against Trump. His campaign sent out a statement on Tuesday touting his $42.7 million fundraising haul in February.  Donald Trump is going to have plenty of money to compete in November, said Jeff Weaver, Sanders campaign manager. Its important that our nominee be able to raise the hundreds of millions of dollars necessary to defeat the Republicans in November.     One group tied to the Democratic Partys progressive wing said it would be wrong to write off Sanders regardless of Tuesdays results - in part because he polls better in whiter northern states that come later in the election cycle. Washingtons professional pundits were wrong when they claimed the fight for the Democratic nomination was over before Bernie Sanders got into the race, theyre wrong if they claim this fight is over now, Charles Chamberlain, Democracy for Americas executive director, said in a statement.

NY court allows fraud claim against Trump University to proceed,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump suffered a legal setback on Tuesday when a New York state court allowed a multimillion-dollar fraud claim against Trump University, filed by the states attorney general, to proceed. The claim is part of a lawsuit that accuses Trump and the now-defunct for-profit venture of misleading thousands of people, who paid up to $35,000 to learn the billionaire businessmans real estate investment strategies. Trump University, which Trump chaired, has become a target for his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, particularly Marco Rubio. Attorney General Eric Schneidermans lawsuit, filed in 2013, seeks $40 million in restitution plus penalties and other costs, his office said. The ruling by a four-judge panel of a mid-level appeals court in Manhattan brings the case closer to a potential trial. It could make it easier for the Trump venture ultimately to be held liable, because the claim does not require proof that there was intent to defraud.  The judges also extended the statute of limitations for the claim back to 2007 instead of 2010, as Trumps attorneys want.  The program stopped taking students in 2010. Todays decision is a clear victory in our effort to hold Donald Trump and Trump University accountable for defrauding thousands of students, Schneiderman said in a statement. The Trump Organizations general counsel, Alan Garten, said he would seek to appeal the ruling, and called the case politically motivated. Schneiderman is a Democrat. We think all these claims are without merit and baseless, Garten said. Ninety-eight percent of those who participated in the programs filled out written surveys giving the programs the highest grades. Class actions are pending in California on similar claims by former Trump University students. Rubio, who hammered Trump over Trump University at last weeks Republican presidential debate, on Tuesday pointed to the New York courts decision at a rally in Minneapolis. The U.S. senator from Florida said prospective Trump University students increased the borrowing limit on their credit cards in order to pay for the course.  Some graduated, some didnt, but in the end the only thing you got was a piece of paper that was worthless and a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump, he said. Thats a fraud case and it is outrageous, Rubio said. ... What he did to those people is what he is doing to Americans now.  At the debate, Trump told Rubio he had won most of the lawsuits involving Trump University. The appeals courts decision revived a second claim for fraud. A lower-court judge had allowed Schneiderman to proceed only on a type of fraud known as common-law fraud, which would have been more difficult to prove. The lower-court judge in Manhattan has already determined that Trump and his university are liable for operating illegally in New York state as an unlicensed educational institution. New York notified Trump in 2005 that he was violating state education law by using the word University when it was not actually chartered as one. In 2010, Trump University changed its name to Trump Entrepreneur Initiative and later that year notified the state Department of Education that it had ceased operations.

South Dakota governor vetoes transgender bathroom bill,"(Reuters) - South Dakota Republican Governor Dennis Daugaard on Tuesday vetoed a bill that would have made his the first U.S. state to dictate what bathrooms transgender students are allowed to use in public schools.  The bill now returns to the legislature, where a two-thirds vote in both chambers would be required for it to pass. The state house approved the bill beyond that threshold in January, but the state Senate did not when it approved in February.   The proposed law would require transgender pupils to use restrooms and locker rooms in public schools that correspond to their gender at birth and not the gender that fits their current identity.  This bill broadly regulates in a manner that invites conflict and litigation, diverting energy and resources from the education of the children of this state, Daugaard said in a statement.  The bill would require schools to provide reasonable accommodations for transgender students. Those accommodations include a single-occupancy restroom, a unisex restroom, or the controlled use of a restroom, locker room or shower room. His decision shows that discrimination against transgender students is not welcome in South Dakota, said Matt McTighe, executive director of Freedom for All Americans, an organization that supports LBGT issues. Civil rights groups have said the law would expose schools to legal challenges over access to restrooms and say it violates Title IX, a federal rule regarding discrimination in public schools. In December, a suburban Chicago school district reached an accord with the U.S. government over locker room access for a transgender student after the U.S. Department of Educations Office of Civil Rights found the district discriminated against the student in violation of Title IX.  Daugaards veto comes about a month after a U.S. appeals court heard arguments over whether a high school in Virginia should be ordered to allow a transgender male student to use the boys bathroom. Last week, local lawmakers in Charlotte, North Carolina, voted to allow transgender people to use public bathrooms matching their gender identity. State House of Representatives Speaker Tim Moore, a Republican, said he would consider legislation to block the measure. ",politicsNews,"March 1, 2016 ",1
"Republican leaders condemn bigotry, but won't talk about Trump","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress condemned white supremacist groups on Tuesday after their partys front-runner in the presidential contest, Donald Trump, failed to disavow support for an ex-Ku Klux Klan leader, but the leaders declined further comment on Trumps controversial White House bid. The comments from the two top Republicans in the U.S. Congress, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, came as many of the partys lawmakers struggle to come to terms with the growing possibility that Trump will be their nominee. Trumps policies are often at odds with those of conservatives, and his comments on the campaign trail have often been both incendiary and crude. He has racked up victories in three of the four states that have already held their nominating contests. The comments from Ryan and McConnell coincided with Super Tuesday, the biggest voting day in the race to pick the 2016 presidential nominees for the November election. Ryan said any Republican nominee must reject any group built on bigotry while McConnell said Senate Republicans condemned groups such as the Klan and everything they stand for. The Klan, whose roots reach back to the Civil War, is known for its segregationist, racist views. In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Trump did not immediately repudiate support from David Duke, a former Klan leader who is also a former Louisiana state representative. Trump later said he had not heard the questions well because of a bad earpiece. Both Ryan and McConnell said they did not want to weigh in further on the presidential race, something they have declined to do for months. Ryan, a former vice presidential candidate who will chair the Republicans national convention in July, reiterated on Tuesday he would support whomever is his partys nominee. A number of Southern states are among the 11 states holding Republican nominating contests on Tuesday, including Virginia, and opinion polls show Trump is likely to consolidate his status as the favorite to win the nomination. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid scoffed at Ryans remark a few hours later. Reid said Republicans were afraid to withdraw their support publicly because the Trump millions might turn on them. Republicans say theyll support a man who refuses to denounce the Ku Klux Klan. So until they withdraw their support, talk is really cheap, Reid said. McConnell sidestepped a question on whether it was true, as reported over the weekend by The New York Times, that he had told fellow Republicans in private that they could drop Trump like a hot rock if he becomes the partys presidential nominee. McConnell said he did not recall saying anything like that to reporters. In recent days other lawmakers on Capitol Hill have become more outspoken on Trump. A handful of lawmakers have endorsed him, including Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a conservative. On Sunday evening, Senator Ben Sasse, a conservative Republican from Nebraska, announced on Facebook that he could not support Trump because his relentless focus is on dividing Americans and on tearing down rather than building back up this glorious nation. If Donald Trump ends up as the GOP nominee, conservatives will need to find a third option, Sasse wrote. But in the halls of Congress on Tuesday, there appeared to be few lawmakers prepared to distance themselves from Trump who had not done so already. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who gave up his own presidential quest in December, said, The partys been burned and the countrys going to get burned by Trump. To avoid this, he said, the party should consolidate around an opponent to Trump instead of diffusing the opposition among so many candidates. Trump is now one of five remaining Republican contenders. The others are Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Ohio Governor John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who had endorsed Jeb Bush before he dropped out, said lawmakers have not shied away from criticizing Trump. That has happened continually. Many of us did it when he made comments about John McCain many months ago, she said, referring to how Trump had mocked the military record of McCain, a Republican senator from Arizona. As a Navy pilot, McCain was shot down over Vietnam. Trump said he liked people who werent captured. ",politicsNews,"March 1, 2016 ",1
Now or never: Trump's 'wall' talk sparks migrant rush on U.S.-Mexico border,"CIUDAD JUAREZ/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Gang violence and poverty have for years pushed Mexicans and Central Americans north to the United States, but recently a new driver has emerged: the anti-immigrant tone of leading Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. From the slums of Central America to close-knit migrant communities in U.S. cities, Trumps rise to the front of the Republican pack has not gone unnoticed and is partly behind a spike in the numbers of migrants trying to enter the country, including children traveling without guardians. Interviews with migrants, people smugglers and officials show many migrants are trying to cross now instead of facing tighter policing and new policies to halt illegal immigration if Trump or another Republican wins the Nov. 8 election. If Trump wins, were all screwed and all Latinos are screwed, Isaias Franco, a 46-year-old from El Salvador who was deported from the United States late last year and is now trying to get back, said at a migrant shelter in Ciudad Juarez, just across the border from El Paso, Texas. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data shows 150,304 migrants were detained trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border between October and February, up 24 percent from the same period last year.  Similar data for unaccompanied child migrants - those traveling without a guardian - is not yet available, but between October and January, 20,455 kids were apprehended on the southwest border, up over 100 percent from a year ago.  (For a graphic, click on tmsnrt.rs/1TM7iDF) The numbers of migrants typically rise as summer approaches. Like other migrants, Franco is aware of the U.S. presidential race and Trumps vow, matched by fellow Republican candidate Ted Cruz, to deport all the illegal immigrants in the United States, estimated at more than 11 million. You watch the news ... Theres a lot of fear among Latinos, Franco said, adding that a Republican victory would spell the end for proposed reforms to give many immigrants greater legal security. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, said migrants understand his policies. It seems they agree Mr. Trump will be tough, build the wall and stop illegal immigration.  Blanca Rivera, who manages the Ciudad Juarez migrant shelter, said she had noticed a recent surge in the numbers of migrants and also blamed the inflammatory rhetoric.  They think they need to take advantage while they can. Trump has built a strong lead in the race for the Republican nomination in part by taking a tough stance on immigration.  He says Mexico is killing the United States with cheap labor and has sent criminals and rapists across the border. He is also promising to build a huge border wall and proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. Although Trump has been the most outspoken candidate, his main rivals also say the government must stop the flow of illegal migrants into the country, mainly from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Trump, Cruz and Florida Senator Marco Rubio all say they would overturn President Barack Obamas executive orders that shield some illegal immigrants from deportation.  In 2014, tens of thousands of child migrants traveling without family members overwhelmed the southern U.S. border, sparking a political crisis. The flow then fell in most of 2015 but has surged again in recent months. Brenda Barrios, a 30-year-old Guatemalan based in Silver Spring, Maryland, crossed illegally into the United States in 2003 with her parents and two sisters.  Her parents were later deported back to Guatemala, and they think it is too dangerous to return but Brenda is encouraging them to come before the end of the year in case Trump wins.  Hes one of the reasons why people are crossing the border. They think he looks like a dictator, she said. Its very dangerous for them to cross. But it will be worse if Trump is president ... Life will be very difficult for us. He doesnt want us here. Still, Barrios and other migrants interviewed said the United States, even under an administration seeking to halt illegal immigration, would still be better than the poverty and violence of their home countries. Since 2014, the murder rate in El Salvador has risen dramatically amid an escalation of gang violence and a regional drought has forced thousands of people, particularly from Guatemala, to head north.  But there are also signs that human smugglers, or coyotes, are taking advantage of the anti-immigrant rhetoric and peddling the idea that now is the time to go.  Victoria Cordova and her 11-year-old daughter Genesis were deported back to Honduras in 2014, after hiking through Mexico and being detained trying to cross into Texas.  She said coyotes in the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa - who charge about $7,000 per person - have been telling people now is the time to leave. Lots of the women here were talking about it, and asked me if I was going to go, she said. People here were saying that in June of this year they were going to give new entry permits. Ruben Garcia, the director of the Annunciation House migrant shelter in El Paso said the next U.S. president, whoever it is, will face the same challenge of migration flows. Things in Central America are terrible, he said. People are going to continue to flee because its just really hard for people to survive right now.

"No breakthrough in Supreme Court dispute between Obama, Republicans","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican leaders of the Senate on Tuesday rebuffed President Barack Obamas appeal for hearings and a vote on his U.S. Supreme Court nominee during a face-to-face meeting that failed to budge them from their vow to block any nominee he offers. Obama, planning to name a replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia in the coming weeks, huddled with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley in the White House Oval Office for less than an hour. Senator Grassley and I made it clear that we dont intend to take up a nominee or to have a hearing, McConnell told reporters after the meeting. The meeting failed to produce any progress on how to proceed with finding a replacement for Scalia, a long-serving conservative justice who died on Feb. 13. McConnell and Grassley are insistent that Obama not pick a nominee and leave the decision to his successor, who takes office next January after the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Obama is insistent that it is the Republican-led Senates constitutional duty to act on his nominee. They made clear in their meeting with the president that theyre not going to change their mind just because the president says so, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said of the Republicans. Earnest said Obama still believes it was worthwhile to consult with the lawmakers before making his nomination. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said Obama stated during the meeting he would be willing to consider candidates for the Supreme Court proposed by the Republicans, but McConnell and Grassley offered no names. We killed a lot of time talking about basketball and other stuff, said Reid, who attended along with the Judiciary Committees top Democrat, Patrick Leahy. Under the Constitution, the president nominates Supreme Court justices and the Senate must confirm them. Without Scalia, the court has four conservative and four liberal justices, meaning any potential Obama nominee could tip the court to the left for the first time in decades. McConnell and Grassley have said allowing the next president to pick the new justice would let voters have a say in the selection when they elect a new president. Whether everybody in the meeting today wanted to admit it, we all know that considering a nomination in the middle of a heated presidential campaign is bad for the nominee, bad for the court, bad for the process and ultimately bad for the nation, Grassley said in a statement.

Illinois judge dismisses Cruz eligibility complaint,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - An Illinois voters lawsuit challenging Ted Cruzs eligibility to run for president of the United States because he was born in Canada was dismissed on a technicality on Tuesday by a state judge. Cook County Circuit Court Judge Maureen Ward Kirby in Chicago ruled that she did not have jurisdiction in the lawsuit - which had sought to have Cruz removed from the states primary election ballot - because it had not been properly served on the state Board of Elections. She found that the plaintiff, Lawrence Joyce, had not properly filed his petition for judicial review. Joyce, a lawyer and a pharmacist from the Chicago suburb of Poplar Grove who supports Cruz rival Ben Carson, initially filed a complaint in January with the elections board. When the board rejected the complaint, he filed the lawsuit seeking judicial review in Cook County.  Kirbys ruling came as voters in 12 other states were taking part in the Super Tuesday Republican and Democratic nominating contests, a milestone in the selection of candidates for the Nov. 8 election. Illinois primary is on March 15, but early voting has already begun. Republican front-runner Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned Cruzs eligibility because of his Canadian birth. Joyces lawsuit argued that Cruz cannot run for president under the U.S. Constitution because the U.S. senator from Texas is not a natural-born citizen. Cruz gained citizenship at birth because his mother was an American citizen, but Joyce contends that was a form of naturalization. Cruzs father is from Cuba. Cruz, himself an attorney, has maintained he is a natural-born American due to his mothers citizenship.  Kirby ruled that Joyce should have served the complaint directly to Cruz and the election board members, not to their lawyers, citing requirements in the Illinois election code. I recognize that election decisions are of great importance to the public, the judge said. But its a matter of strict compliance. She said she could not look at the issues presented in the case because it was not properly before her. Joyce said he has not yet decided whether he will appeal the ruling. He said it depended on whether Trump, as expected, dominates in the Super Tuesday contests and becomes the most likely Republican nominee. My main concern all along has been keeping Senator Cruz from being the nominee of the party. Depending on what happens today on Super Tuesday, that whole point might become a moot point, Joyce told reporters. Joyce said he did not want Cruz to win the nomination because he believes Democrats would then seek to have the Texan disqualified because he was born abroad. An attorney who represented Cruz in court, Sharee Langenstein, called the lawsuit a misguided attempt to distract the voters away from the most qualified candidate we have for president, and thats Senator Ted Cruz.  Theres no issue here, she said. Its very clear that Senator Cruz is a natural-born citizen. Voters in New York, Alabama, Pennsylvania and Texas have also filed legal challenges to Cruzs eligibility. Some legal experts do not expect any court to invalidate a presidential candidate on the issue.

Wall Street's big short: President Donald J. Trump,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Add the juggernaut that is Donald J. Trump to the list of what-ifs that is worrying Wall Street. A growing realization that the unpredictable New York real estate developer is in a position to win the Republican nomination and then battle Hillary Clinton for the White House in Novembers election has caused some investors to sell U.S. stocks. They fear having such a wild-card president could trigger trade wars, hurt the economy and add a lot of market volatility. As the market rarely feastson lack of predictability - Trump represents a nightmare for investors this year, said hedge fund manager Douglas Kass of Seabreeze Partners Management Inc, who said last week that he was adding to his existing short bet on the U.S. stock market in part because of Trumps increasingly strong position in the race.  Trumps statements on business and Wall Street dont neatly fit into one ideological worldview, but if anything, they are seen as isolationist in a globally connected world. He can also suddenly pick on businesses over various issues, such as his call for a boycott of Apple Incs (AAPL.O) products after the tech giant refused to help the FBI unlock the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.  The election this year is the height of uncertainty, said Phil Orlando, a senior portfolio manager and chief equity strategist at Federated Investors in New York, which manages $351 billion. He said political concerns - personified by Trumps emergence as a frontrunner - are one of the main reasons why he began reducing equity exposure in mid-January. There are, of course, plenty of otherfactors having an impact on U.S. financial markets. U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday after strong U.S. factory and construction data suggested the economy was regaining momentum. That was even as investors contemplated expectations that Trump would do very well in 11 states holding Republican primary or caucus elections on this Super Tuesday.   Trumps rhetoric mixes populist criticism of immigration policy, Wall Street behavior, and other countries trade policies, while also citing support for business-friendly efforts such as lower taxation. The lack of detail from Trump about his policies and how he would implement them is a particular worry for investors.  Trump has been light on policy substance so its very difficult for the markets to handicap, said Dave Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Global Asset Management, which manages $870.3 billion in assets. He expects market volatility to rise if Trump extends his lead in Tuesdays elections.  Some investors are particularly concerned about Trumps nationalist rhetoric, saying it is potentially destructive to a global economy that is already struggling. If it reduces trade flows then it could also hamper U.S. and global growth and hurt U.S. company profits. The real estate investor proposes labeling China a currency manipulator and ending what he calls Chinas illegal export subsidies and theft of U.S. intellectual property. He also wants to penalize companies who move jobs from the U.S. to Mexico by hitting them with high tariffs if they want to export back to the U.S., as well as build a wall at the Mexican border to prevent the flow of illegal immigrants. Inareas of trade policy and foreign affairs lies the greatest uncertainty, Kass said. Trump is not likely tobe market-friendly in any of these policy areas. In response, Trumps spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in an email to Reuters that the same crowd criticizing the Republican Partys top candidate had been responsible for causing the last worldwide recession and economic meltdown in 2007-2008. They have zero credibility, said Hicks. Mr. Trump will restore confidence to the global markets by ending runaway spending and borrowing, restoring trade balance and fairness, and bringing wealth to Americas middle class. Investors had, for some time, been concerned about the strength of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders insurgent campaign for the Democratic nomination against former Secretary of State Clinton, given he declares himself to be a democratic socialist and has said Wall Streets business model is fraudulent. With recent losses to Clinton in Democratic contests in South Carolina and Nevada, he is now seen as less likely to win the nomination. Trumps plans include ideas that traditionally come from Republican candidates, such as lowering the corporate tax rate, simplifying the tax code, and as his web site puts it, cutting the deficit through eliminating waste, fraud and abuse and growing the economy to increase tax revenues.  I think markets will like Trump on the taxes issue since he favors lower rates and a permanent change in repatriation rules, said David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors in Sarasota, Florida, which manages $2 billion in assets. Still, financial advisers say that Trumps plans to do away with the so-called carried interest tax loophole - which gives hedge fund and private equity managers preferential tax treatment on much of their income - would prompt more selling if he begins to climb in national polls against Clinton. Jeffrey Gundlach, the co-founder and CEO of bond investing and trading powerhouse DoubleLine Capital, said that Trump has a history of being comfortable with a lot of debt and leverage, and that wont impede him from spending heavily. He said he believes Trumps pledge to spend heavily on the military makes defense stocks a good investment play.  Others see such spendthrift tendencies more darkly.  David Ader, chief government bond strategist at CRT Capital Group in Stamford, Connecticut, said Trumps history raises questions about his ability to run an organization as unwieldy and complex as the government. The businessman has in the past filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the Trump Taj Mahal casino and Trump Plaza Hotel.  Ader says the uncertainty would cause investors to flock to safe-haven U.S. Treasuries should Trump take office.  Its one thing to run casinos that have gone bankrupt, its another to run a country and its foreign policy, he said.  Whether he would enjoy the support of the Senate and House of Representatives is a critical question, and will determine how many of his policy pronouncements can be turned into legislation. Congress could act as a brake if Trump gets the presidency and behaves as wildly as Trump the candidate. He clearly does not have the full support of a number of key Republican senators and would be unlikely to get much Democratic support for many measures.  Todd Morgan, senior managing partner at wealth management firm Bel Air Investments Advisors in Los Angeles, said that the increasing likelihood that Trump will be the Republican nominee is one reason why he has raised cash in some client portfolios over the past four months. He would likely sell more if it looks like Trump will win the general election, he said.  Its like a scale and you keep dropping more weights on the balance everyday, and the political uncertainty is becoming a bigger and bigger weight, he said.

"NSA chief says 'when, not if' foreign country hacks U.S. infrastructure","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. National Security Agency chief said on Tuesday it was a matter of when, not if a foreign nation-state attempts to launch a cyber attack on the U.S. critical infrastructure, citing the recent hack on Ukraines power grid as a cause for concern. Speaking at the RSA cyber security conference in San Francisco, Admiral Michael Rogers said he was also worried about data manipulation and potential offensive cyber threats posed by non-nation-state actors such as Islamic State. The U.S. government said last week a December blackout in Ukraine that affected 225,000 customers was the result of a cyber attack, supporting what most security researchers had already concluded.  Some private researchers have linked the incident to a Russian hacking group known as Sandworm. ",politicsNews,"March 1, 2016 ",1
Senate's McConnell condemns white supremacists,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday condemned white supremacists, in remarks responding to presidential candidate Donald Trump and his failure to disavow a white supremacist group in an interview. McConnell told reporters that there had been a lot of talk in the past 24 hours about one of our presidential candidates and his seeming ambivalence to the Ku Klux Klan white supremacist group and David Duke, a former Klan leader. So let me make it perfectly clear. Senate Republicans condemn David Duke, the KKK, his racism, McConnell told reporters, adding the Republicans condemned everything they stand for.

Secret Service investigating incident at Trump rally: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Secret Service is investigating a confrontation between a Time magazine photographer and a Secret Service agent at a rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in Virginia, the White House said on Tuesday. The Secret Service is working with local law enforcement to try to get to the bottom of what exactly happened, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters during a briefing. The leadership of the Secret Service has indicated that theyll take appropriate steps based on the conclusion of that investigation.  The rally on Monday was interrupted by protesters, including some from the Black Lives Matter movement. A photographer who was trying to document their removal from the rally was grabbed by the neck and shoved to the ground by a U.S. Secret Service agent.

"Secret Service probing agent, photographer fight at Trump rally ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Secret Service is investigating an incident at presidential candidate Donald Trumps rally in Radford, Virginia in which an agent shoved a Time magazine photographer to the ground, an agency spokesman said on Tuesday. We are investigating the matter fully to find out what our employee did and what the other person did, Kevin Dye told Reuters.  Video footage of the altercation on Monday, which was posted on the Internet, shows Time magazine photographer Christopher Morris getting close to the agent, who threw him to the ground and Morris kicking the agent from the floor. The magazine said Morris was knocked to the ground after stepping out of the press hold to take a picture of protesters. A Trump campaign spokeswoman acknowledged the incident, but said the campaign was not aware of the details. In a statement published in Time, Morris said he had covered the White House for nine years without altercations with the Secret Service. The rules at Trump events are significantly stricter than other campaigns and make it very difficult to work as a photographer, as many others have pointed out before me, Morris said. I regret my role in the confrontation, but the agents response was disproportionate and unnecessarily violent. Free speech advocates have decried Trumps treatment of protesters and reporters at his rallies, including ushering out dissenters and shouting at the press.   The Secret Service said it would never intervene to quiet protesters or restrict journalists unless there was a public safety matter.  The Secret Services role is to protect the candidate and the public, Dye said. (Agents are) not in any way responsible for removing protesters. We have a strong commitment to upholding the First Amendment. Trump and Ben Carson are the only two Republican presidential contenders to receive Secret Service protection, along with Democratic contenders Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Candidates must request the coverage.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest on Tuesday acknowledged that the Secret Service has indicated it would look at this particular situation.

Supreme Court standoff looms over Republicans' Senate defense,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans refusal to consider any Supreme Court nominee by President Barack Obama this year could jeopardize the partys control of the Senate, as Democrats use the standoff to challenge vulnerable opponents in an election year. Congressional leaders met with Obama at the White House on Tuesday about replacing recently deceased Justice Antonin Scalia, and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnells stance opposing any nomination by Obama. Neither side gave ground. The showdown over the issue is already being used by Democrats to target Republican senators in states including Ohio, Wisconsin, Illinois, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, even though elections are not until November. The Democrats have two goals. One is opening a new line of attack on Republicans in states that tend to vote Democratic in presidential election years. The other is chipping away at McConnells position, which may be hard to maintain over time. The Democrats strategy will not work, said Republicans, who maintain the Supreme Court showdown actually helps them in some races and that other issues are much more important. Voters worry more about economic and national security issues than the Supreme Court, Tom Ridge, former Republican governor of Pennsylvania, said in an interview. The court fight may have an impact, but at best, I think its marginal. The issue has a long way to play out. Obama has yet to name a nominee. Also, the Supreme Court has not yet deadlocked 4-4 since Scalias death on a high-profile issue, so there has been no stalemate to test the publics reaction. But by haranguing vulnerable incumbents, such as Illinois Republican Mark Kirk, Democrats hope to convince swing voters that stone-walling on any Obama nominee is a dereliction of duty. Faced with this attack, Kirk last week broke ranks with McConnell and said hearings should be held on a nominee. His possible general election opponent, Democratic Representative Tammy Duckworth, told Reuters she has hammered away at Kirk on the Senate confirmation process. He would not have said anything if I had not pushed so hard, she said. In Ohio and Pennsylvania, three-quarters of those polled said the Senate should at least see whom Obama nominates before deciding whether or not to confirm the nominee, according to Public Policy Polling surveys conducted Feb. 19-21. Former Pennsylvania Democratic Governor Ed Rendell told Reuters the Supreme Court battle will be trouble for Republicans. This will bring into dramatic focus, with crystal clarity, the importance of the presidential election concerning the Supreme Court, Rendell said. Liberal activist group Moveon.org last week sponsored a 30-second cable television spot urging Senate Republicans to Do your job and consider an Obama appointee. At the same time, conservative group Judicial Crisis Network launched a 30-second video thanking Senator Patrick Toomey, who supports McConnells position, for letting the people decide on replacing Scalia. Republicans must defend 24 Senate seats in November. Democrats have only 10 to defend. Senator Rob Portman, a first-term Republican who faces a tough re-election in Ohio, has also sided with McConnell. Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who was swept into office in 2010 by the Tea Party movement, is running 11 points behind Democrat Russ Feingold, the former senator he beat six years ago, a Marquette Law School Poll last week showed. To win, analysts said, Johnson must garner support from a different, presidential-year electorate that is likely to be younger, racially more diverse and with a potentially greater interest in moving forward with a Supreme Court nominee. So far the court debate has helped Johnson solidify support among Republicans, two-thirds of whom support McConnells stand. ",politicsNews,"March 1, 2016 ",1
Obama asked Republican leaders to offer top court nominee: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama asked Republican congressional leaders for suggestions on a Supreme Court nominee during a meeting on Tuesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. Obama met with Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, both Republicans, in the Oval Office to discuss a replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia. The president ... gave everyone in the room, Democrats and Republicans, the opportunity to put forward their own suggestions for potential Supreme Court nominees, Earnest said at a news briefing. The president didnt guarantee that he would choose that person, but the president did indicate that he would take seriously any recommendations that either Democrats or Republicans had to put forward.  Earnest declined to say whether any Republican congressional leaders, who have said the top court seat should remain vacant until Obamas successor takes office next year, offered any names. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid and Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the judiciary panel, also attended the meeting. ",politicsNews,"March 1, 2016 ",1
German minister warns on Washington trip against 'politics of fear',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Germanys foreign minister warned during a trip to Washington on Tuesday about a rise in the use of populist fear tactics by politicians on both sides of the Atlantic, describing this as a threat to Europe, the United States and transatlantic relations. Speaking at George Washington University on Super Tuesday, the biggestsingle day of state-by-state presidential nominating contests, Frank-Walter Steinmeier did not refer to Donald Trump or other candidates by name but he said he was concerned about the tone of the U.S. campaign. In Germany and in Europe, something is gaining momentum in our domestic politics - and to be honest, I am also seeing it here in the United States during the primary campaigns. Its the politics of fear, Steinmeier said. Politicians in Germany and elsewhere in Europe have watched nervously as businessman and reality TV star Trump has moved from a long shot to the front-runner among Republicans seeking the partys nomination to run in the Nov. 8 general election. Trump has described Chancellor Angela Merkels welcoming policy towards refugees as insane and predicted it would cause rioting in Germany. He has also praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been at odds with Europe since Moscows annexation of Ukraines Crimea region two years ago. Germany does not face a federal election until next year. But a new anti-immigrant party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), has emerged as a threat to Merkels conservatives. The AfD wants Germany to shut its border to migrants and use force to repel them if necessary. They pretend that we can seal ourselves off and leave the world outside to deal with its own problems. But thats wrong, Steinmeier said, referring to politicians in Europe and the United States. The worst thing we could do is seal ourselves off, he said. In a subtle dig at Trump, who has promised to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and make the Mexicans pay for it, the German foreign minister added: So if you ask me: building walls is a very bad idea - no matter who pays for them.

Trump's low advertising spending weighs on U.S. broadcasters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has upended the presidential primaries this year by relying heavily on free air time and Twitter at the expense of local-ad buying, throwing into question estimates that the November presidential election could translate into $6 billion spent on TV advertising. Now, with no Trump TV ads scheduled going into the 11-state Super Tuesday primaries, some investors and analysts are growing increasingly concerned that Trump could continue with an advertising-light strategy built on bruising debate performances and large rallies - often shown on cable TV - even if he wins the Republican Party nomination. For the broadcast industry, which has pinned its 2016 on local TV ad spend, you have to believe that someone who is pretty amazing at leveraging the power of social media would be a real problem for television, said media analyst Rich Greenfield with New York-based equity firm BTIG Research. I think Trump elevates that to a whole new level. So far, some $10-million has been spent on advertising for Donald Trump, compared with $32 million for Hillary Clinton, $49 million for Marco Rubio, and almost $85 million for Jeb Bush, according to data from Ad Age. Bush dropped out of the Republican contest earlier this month after trailing badly. I would be worried if I was a broadcaster if Trump won, said media industry analyst Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson Research. Trumps decision to steer clear of political action committees and use most of his own money makes it hard to assume that he will act like a traditional candidate, he said.     The concern over Trumps impact comes at a time when shares of many broadcasters who were counting on a strong political advertising market are hurting. So far this year, shares of Nexstar Broadcasting Group Inc are down 23.9 percent, Gray Television Incs stock has fallen 29.2 percent, and shares of E.W. Scripps Co, which Wells Fargo analyst Marci Ryvicker had previously pegged as one of the most likely to benefit from political spending, are down 9.2 percent. Wells cut its outlook for Scripps on Monday. Its just not looking like the kind of environment that we were counting on, said one prominent small-cap fund manager who says he has been selling shares of E.W. Scripps because of Trumps candidacy. He did not want to give his name because his trades are not yet public. Broadcasters, like all media companies, have also been hurt by the growing trend of consumers canceling their cable subscriptions, a practice known as cord cutting, not to mention an economy that has been less than robust. To be sure, some analysts caution that it is still relatively early in the election cycle, and that Trump will likely pivot to a more advertising-heavy campaign should he become the Republican nominee, especially as he is likely to face a battery of TV ad attacks from Clinton, who is widely expected to be the Democrat candidate. Any pullback in spending on Trumps part will likely be offset by spending to influence votes at state and local level on various measures that will be on the November ballot, as well as ad buys for other Congressional elections, said Tracy Young, an analyst at Evercore. The death earlier this month of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has made the key Senate races more important as the next Senate is likely to play a key role in who his successor will be. If New York businessman Michael Bloomberg or another prominent figure decides to stand as an independent or third-party candidate it could also drive total political spending higher. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, has told his aides to draw up plans for an independent campaign for the U.S. presidency  and has indicated he would be willing to spend at least $1 billion of his own money, a source familiar with the situation said last month. A total $3.8 billion was spent on all political TV advertising in 2012, the last presidential election year, according to research firm Kantar Media CMAG. Of that total, spending by the Obama and Romney campaigns and related advocacy groups was only $953 million. We view the political season as a bonus we get every two years, said Salvatore Muoio, whose firm, New York-based S Muoio & Co LLC,  invests in a number of local broadcasters such as Tegna, Nextar and Media General, and is still bullish on the sector. Companies, meanwhile, are telling investors that they are not worried. A Trump nomination would not be a negative effect because once it becomes a nationwide campaign post-convention, money will need to be spent to win, Nexstar Broadcasting, which expects to bring in $100 million from political spending this cycle, told analysts on its earnings call last Wednesday. The Democrats and Republicans both hold their conventions in late July. Nexstar owns, operates or provides programming to 104 television stations reaching 62 markets across the country, including Florida, Texas, California and West Virginia. Steven Marks, co-chief operating officer  of Sinclair Broadcast Group, which has 164 stations stretching from Iowa to Ohio and Florida, told analysts Thursday that I would suspect that if hes the nominee, and this is just me thinking out loud, the RNC (Republican National Committee) is going to have no choice but to back him and the money will flow. The prize is too big.      Still, little of that money will likely come from Trumps campaign itself, said Steve Passwaiter, business development lead at Kantar Media Intelligence.       This guy is the king of earned media, Passwaiter said. When every tweet you send out is posted on 3 billion websites you dont have to spend a whole heck of a lot of money.

Trump's immigration outrage poses challenge for Cruz in Texas,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Republican Ted Cruzs hopes of a sweeping nominating victory in his home state of Texas are being eroded as Donald Trump taps into conservative anger over immigration. Polls show Cruz, the U.S. senator from Texas, is poised to win the states nominating contest on Tuesday - the biggest voting day so far in the 2016 race - a result seen as essential to keeping alive his chance of winning his partys nomination. But he could be stopped short of thresholds required to sweep its 155 delegates to the Republican convention if national front-runner Trump and other rivals win enough of the vote. Cruz needs as resounding a victory as possible to stay competitive on a day when Trump is expected to put in a dominant performance in other states voting on Super Tuesday. Interviews with more than two dozen voters in Texas suggest that Trumps anti-immigration platform - which includes building a Mexico-funded border wall and deporting millions of illegal immigrants - could present Cruzs biggest weakness against the real estate mogul.  The senator proposes similarly tough policies to prevent illegal immigration, but many Texans credit Trump with vaulting it to a top issue in the election, largely because of his tough, outraged tone rather than policy differences. Trump has been honest enough to say what were all thinking but were all scared to say, said Sharon Neil, 68, of Fort Worth, who is voting for Trump. Republicans in Texas, home to about 1.5 million undocumented immigrants, rank immigration the third most important problem facing the country, compared to seventh overall nationwide, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. And fans of Trump were twice as likely nationwide as Cruz supporters to say immigration was a top issue. Scott Ragno, 39, another Trump supporter from Fort Worth, said Trumps tone on immigration was attractive. Is building a fence the right answer? I dont know about that. But I definitely think hed do something to curb the problem.  Cruz has a strong base of support among Texass grassroots Tea Party activists, high-profile endorsements including the states governor Greg Abbott, and a lead in most recent polls in Texas. He got 42 percent of support in a CBS News poll released on Sunday, compared to 31 percent for Trump. And Cruz led by 39 percent to Trumps 26 percent in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll the same day. Cruz's lead over Trump in Texas has, however, shown signs of decline, according to polls aggregated by Huffington Post since the two launched their campaigns in June. (here#!selected=Cruz,Trump )  Winning a majority of votes in a Texas district allows a candidate to sweep all of the district's delegates. A candidate  gets to sweep an additional category of 47 delegates if he wins a majority of the vote statewide - an outcome that is unlikely for Cruz.(here)  Trump has vented over immigration from the get-go, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and drug dealers at his campaign launch in June. At his rallies, he recounts incidents where Americans were killed by illegal immigrants. Cruz has pledged to build a wall too. During a Republican debate on Thursday, he criticized Trump for giving money to politicians who tried to overhaul immigration laws, including by offering new protections to people in the country illegally. Cruz has argued Trump has been inconsistent, criticizing him for hiring foreign workers instead of Americans to work at his Florida hotel. It is a fact that for four decades Donald Trump has supported open-borders Democrats, Cruz said Monday in San Antonio. Nobody who supports open-border Democrats for 40 years can care about securing the borders.   Trump, who held a rally in Fort Worth on Friday and packed a convention center hall with raucous supporters, has hit back by saying Cruz has toughened his stance on immigration lately mainly because of him. Voters in the Houston and Fort Worth areas described concerns about immigration ranging from overcrowded schools to more crime to cultural change.  Its not that we dont want (immigrants) here, said Neil, the Trump supporter. But she said she felt immigrants were taking a toll on the public school system - an issue close to her heart because her daughter-in-law is a teacher and her son is studying education.

Nobel laureate Vargas Llosa calls Trump a 'clown and a racist',"MADRID (Reuters) - Peruvian Nobel prize-winning author Mario Vargas Llosa said on Tuesday that Donald Trump was a clown and a racist who would doom the Republican party to defeat if it chose him as its candidate for Novembers U.S. presidential election. He is a danger to the United States, said Vargas Llosa, who himself ran as a center-right candidate for the Peruvian presidency in 1990. It is a country that is too important for the rest of the world to have in the White House a clown, a demagogue and a racist like Mr Trump, he told a news conference in Madrid to launch his new novel, Cinco esquinas (Five Corners). Trump, the frontrunner in the Republican primaries, has said he wants to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and deport 11 million illegal immigrants. He also suggested, at his campaign launch last June, that Mexican immigrants were rapists and drug dealers. Vargas Llosa said Trumps seemingly unstoppable campaign would guarantee another term for the Democratic party.  Hillary Clinton surely will win a massive victory if the Republican candidate is Donald Trump, he said.  Vargas Llosa, 79, won the Nobel Literature Prize in 2010 and now lives mainly in Madrid. He is known for books such as The Time of the Hero that explore Latin Americas structures of political power.

Rubio backers spend big in Texas ahead of Super Tuesday,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Backers of Republican presidential hopeful Marco Rubio have spent nearly as much money in the weeks leading up to Super Tuesdays nominating contests as all of his rivals combined, including an outsized spend in Texas. The Super PAC supporting the U.S. senator from Florida, Conservative Solutions, poured $4.2 million into 10 Super Tuesday states between Feb. 10 and Feb. 27, almost twice as much as groups backing rival Ted Cruz, according to a Reuters analysis of Federal Election Commission filings. Super PACs supporting all candidates combined, including Rubio, spent $8.8 million in those states during that period.  The biggest chunk of money from Rubio's allied Super PAC was $1.5 million targeting U.S. Senator Cruz's home state of Texas, the biggest prize among the Super Tuesday states in terms of the number of delegates up for grabs. (Click here for a graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1Lr2J0c ) Cruz is poised to defeat Republican front-runner Donald Trump in Texas by a double-digit margin, with Rubio running a distant third in opinion polls. Efforts to reach an official at Conservative Solutions were unsuccessful, but experts said the spending could be an effort to prevent Cruz from reaching a threshold of victory that would allow him to sweep the states 155 delegates. Given the delegate allocation, if Rubio can keep Trump or Cruz under 50 percent in some districts, he stops them from getting all the delegates in that district, said University of Houston political science professor Brandon Rottinghaus. In the Texas Republican primary, delegates are allocated proportionally by congressional district. Texas-based Republican strategist Joe Brettell said a strong showing by Rubio in the state could also help the 44-year-old senator justify another run for the presidency in 2020 if he should fail to win the nomination this time.  Rubio has emerged as the Republican establishments favored candidate to take on Trump for the presidential nomination, drawing a flood of endorsements and donor cash since former Florida Governor Jeb Bush dropped out on Feb. 20. But the senator has struggled to distinguish himself from Cruz in both the polls and recent nominating contests. Cruzs allied Super PAC spent $738,000 in his home state during the period. Trumps campaign is largely self-funded and he does not have an allied Super PAC. The review of Super PAC spending does not include money spent by campaigns, which are set to disclose their February spending on March 20. Super PACs supporting the candidates, as well as other outside groups trying to influence voters, are required to notify the Federal Election Commission shortly after purchasing ads. Super PACs, which were created after the U.S. Supreme Courts Citizens United decision in 2010, can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money but are barred from coordinating with the campaigns.  This year is shaping up to be one of the most expensive elections in American history. And a lot of the money lately has been spent targeting Trump.  Between the Super PACs supporting Rubio and Cruz as well as other groups that are working to bring down Trump, $7.2 million has been spent in Super Tuesday states and in national ad buys attacking the New York real estate billionaire, according to the Reuters review. One of the ads the Conservative Solutions PAC is running in Texas takes aim at Trump University, a for-profit program he launched that is now the subject of lawsuits from unhappy attendees. Trump called for the ad to be taken down, saying it was inaccurate.

Trump rivals call for release of NY Times editorial board tape,"SAN ANTONIO (Reuters) - Donald Trumps Republican presidential rivals urged him on Monday to ask the New York Times to release a recording of an interview he did with the newspapers editorial board, following a report he told it he was not serious about his immigration proposals. News website BuzzFeed reported on Monday that Trump had suggested to the Times editorial board in an off-the-record briefing on Jan. 5 that he would likely not stand by his immigration proposals if elected president. Trump, the Republican front-runner, has called for deporting all illegal immigrants and has said he would get the Mexican government to pay for building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Donald Trump should ask The New York Times to release the audio of his interview with him so we can see exactly what it is he truly believes about this issue that he has made the cornerstone of his campaign, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said in a statement. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas called on Trump to do so before this weeks Super Tuesday, the biggestsingle day of state-by-state presidential nominating contests for the Nov. 8 presidential election.

"Hecklers disrupt Trump rally, photographer shoved to the ground","WASHINGTON - A Donald Trump rally in Virginia was repeatedly disrupted on Monday by protesters, including some from the Black Lives Matter movement, in a stark display of the divisions the Republican front-runners presidential campaign has long been accused of sowing. A Time magazine photographer trying to document the exit of dozens of black protesters from the rally in southwestern Radford, Virginia, was grabbed by the neck and shoved to the ground by a U.S. Secret Service agent. Hecklers disrupted the rally on a day when the New York billionaire fended off criticism that he had not clearly condemned white supremacist support during an interview on CNN on Sunday. Trump taunted the protesters, shouting Are you from Mexico? at one of them. Supporters in the audience confronted the hecklers in angry, face-to-face exchanges. As black protesters were escorted from the rally, the crowd around them began to chant, All lives matter. Trump waited for the scene to quiet down before saying, Folks, youre going to hear it once: All lives matter. The crowd roared with applause.   Black Lives Matter is a civil rights movement that sprang from police shootings of black Americans in recent years. The Trump rally took place on the eve of Super Tuesday, the biggest voting day in the race to pick the 2016 presidential nominees for the November election. A number of Southern states including Virginia are holding contests on Tuesday, and opinion polls show Trump is likely to consolidate his status as favorite to win the Republican nomination. It was unclear whether Trump would be damaged by support from white supremacists. He has risen in opinion polls and won three of four early nominating contests while proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, calling Mexican immigrants criminals and insulting women. His rivals for the Republican nomination, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, urged him to ask the New York Times to release a recording of his recent interview with its editorial board, following a report he told it he was not serious about his immigration proposals. On Monday, the protesters disrupted Trumps remarks several times for long stretches, prompting him to shout to security guards several times, Get them out please, get them out.  Trump appeared to relish the discord, saying after the turmoil in the crowd that his rallies were more exciting than those of the other candidates: But it is fun, and exciting. At a rally last week in Nevada, Trump also jumped into the fray with a protester when he said, Id like to punch him in the face. Time photographer Chris Morris was on the fringe of an enclosed media section when he was seized by an agent from the  Secret Service, which has the job of protecting the U.S. president and some White House candidates. I stepped 18 inches out of the (press) pen and then he grabbed me by the neck and started choking me and then he slammed me to the ground, Morris told CNN at the scene. The Trump campaign said it was not aware of the details of the incident and directed inquires to local law enforcement. Secret Service spokesman Robert Hoback said the agency was aware of the incident involving one of its employees but it still working to determine the exact circumstances that led up to this incident. Earlier on Monday, Trumps rivals criticized him for equivocating on white supremacist support when he was asked repeatedly on CNN if he would condemn the Klan and disavow support from white supremacists, including David Duke, a former Klan grand wizard from Louisiana. Trump said that he had been hampered by a faulty earpiece during the CNN interview. Duke on Monday denied that he had endorsed Trump. But he said he planned to vote for him and had advised his friends to do so too because of the candidates views on immigration and world peace. Duke told Fox News Radio he disapproved of Trumps lip service in support of Israel, but I told my people to vote for him in the election for strategic reasons. He said he had not been part of the Ku Klux Klan for nearly 40 years.     On the Democratic side, front-runner Hillary Clinton alluded to the countrys divisions on Monday after a landslide victory on Saturday in South Carolinas primary shifted her attention from party rival Bernie Sanders to the candidate she may end up facing in November. I dont think America ever stopped being great, she told supporters in Massachusetts, adding a twist to Trumps Make America Great Again slogan. What we need to do now is make America whole.

U.S. State Department releases final batch of Clinton emails,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department released the final batch of Hillary Clintons emails on Monday from her time at the agencys helm, bringing the final tally of emails it says contain classified information to more than 2,000. The department has been regularly releasing batches of her work emails in keeping with a judges order. But Mondays release of the final 1,700 messages does not end the controversy and legal uncertainty dogging Clintons Democratic presidential campaign since her use of a private email server came to light a year ago. Republican rivals in the battle for the Nov. 8 election have cited the email controversy in saying Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, is unfit for the presidency. Clinton, secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, has said her email arrangement broke no rules and that she will be vindicated. One of the newly released exchanges shows Clinton and Jake Sullivan, one of her closest aides, in a discussion now entirely censored as secret, the second-highest level in the governments three-tier classification system.  The messages, sent on June 7, 2012, bear the subject Khar - where we are - likely a reference to Hina Rabbani Khar, Pakistans foreign minister. The previous day, Pakistan had renewed its insistence that the United States apologize for an air attack that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers. All told, classified information appears in 2,093 of the 30,300 work emails and attachments Clintons lawyers returned to the department in 2014, including 261 such emails released on Monday. That information is obscured with white boxes in the public copies.  The government forbids sending or storing classified information outside secure, government-controlled channels. The FBI has taken the server and is investigating with U.S. Justice Department attorneys whether laws were broken through the unusual arrangement. The State Departments inspector general and at least two Republican-led congressional committees are conducting similar inquiries.  The State Department is investigating how much of the information in the more than 2,000 emails marked as classified was classified at the time they were sent. The vast majority of those messages - 2,028 - contain information classified at the confidential level, the lowest, including scores sent by Clinton herself. A further 65 contain secret information, including at least one written by Clinton, while 22 contain top-secret information from U.S. intelligence agencies, which have been entirely withheld from release. Members of the public are still fighting the department in court for access to thousands of public records connected to some of Clintons closest aides. Last week, a federal judge granted a request by a conservative group suing the State Department under open records laws to seek sworn testimony from department officials and Clinton aides to see if the arrangement was intended to thwart public access to government records. Clintons staff has accused the government of overclassifying, and attribute the large number of emails now marked as classified to an interagency dispute between the State Department and intelligence agencies. At most, only a few dozen of the 2,000 classified emails included information from intelligence agencies, according to several people familiar with those agencies analyses of the emails. The vast majority of the classified information originated with State Department ambassadors and employees, including Clinton herself. State Department lawyers told a federal judge last week they still did not know who in the government authorized Clintons email arrangement or why. Clinton has said the arrangement was for her convenience, but that she now regrets it. The Justice Department, seeking to rebut suggestions that President Barack Obamas administration may have inappropriate influence on its investigation, has not briefed the White House on its progress, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Monday.

Thomas ends decade of self-imposed silence at Supreme Court,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Clarence Thomas ended a decade of silence from the bench during Supreme Court arguments on Monday when the conservative justice unexpectedly posed questions during a gun rights case from Maine. His comments, which surprised courtroom observers and then held them rapt, focused on Thomas concern that people convicted of domestic-violence misdemeanors could permanently lose the right to own a firearm. Thomas has been a consistent vote on the court for robust gun rights under the U.S. Constitutions Second Amendment. Thomas, 67, had not asked a question during oral arguments since Feb. 22, 2006, when he made queries during a South Carolina death penalty case. His words came just over two weeks after the death of fellow conservative Antonin Scalia, who had been one of the most outspoken justices during arguments as well as a strong advocate for gun rights. Thomas questions were directed at Ilana Eisenstein, an assistant U.S. solicitor general who was defending a federal firearms statute. At issue was when a prior state misdemeanor domestic assault conviction based on recklessness may lead to a person being barred from ever owning a gun again under federal law. His first words were, Ms. Eisenstein, one question. Can you give me another area where a misdemeanor violation suspends a constitutional right? Thomas asked. Eisenstein stressed that Congress was concerned about future harm by individuals convicted of battering their family members. She said lawmakers particularly wanted to prevent gun violence. Thomas asked whether either of the defendants involved in Mondays cases had used a weapon against a family member. Eisenstein said no. So ... the suspension is not directly related to the use of the weapon, Thomas said. Its just a family members involved in a misdemeanor violation; therefore a constitutional right is suspended. Thomas, the courts only black justice, in the past has attributed his reluctance to ask questions to a few factors, some personal. He told a group of students in 2000 that his reluctance to speak during arguments arose from a shyness tracing to his birth in Pin Point, Georgia, and his childhood with his grandparents in nearby Savannah: I had grown up speaking a kind of dialect.  In part to avoid the ridicule of classmates, Thomas said, I just started developing the habit of listening. ... I didnt ask questions in college or law school. I could learn better just listening. Thomas has also said he thinks his colleagues interrupt the lawyers too much and that the lawyers should be able to explain their positions.",politicsNews,"February 29, 2016 ",1
Super Tuesday showdown: How the South won the spotlight,"ATLANTA (Reuters) - Things were not looking too good a year ago for Georgias top elections officer as he tried to stitch together a mega-presidential primary in the U.S. South. Efforts to bring Alabama and Arkansas online had stalled. Tennessee was threatening to defect.  But Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp kept working the phones, arguing that a bloc of Southern states all voting on March 1 was the only way to make U.S. presidential candidates pay attention to the region.  Eventually key state leaders came around and their effort seems to have paid off.  Candidates have campaigned more in the South this election year in an effort to woo a group of states voting early on so-called Super Tuesday than Kemp can recall seeing in any contemporary primary. And the seven states holding contests in the region appear poised to play a pivotal role in selecting the Republican and Democratic nominees for the Nov. 8 race. In years past, weve been an afterthought, Kemp said at the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta last week. Thats certainly not the case this year. Elections officials nationally are watching how the concurrent races in the South play out on Tuesday, and are talking about possibly replicating the strategy in other parts of the country to win a greater say in the primaries. Kemp has dubbed the coordinated Southern races that hes orchestrated the SEC primary - or Southeastern Conference primary - after a regional college athletic conference. This represents an attempt to introduce primary reform, said Kay Stimson, spokeswoman for the National Association of Secretaries of State, which for years has urged holding regional primaries that would rotate around the nation. Brian Kemp took the ball and ran with it, she added. It was not easy.  A year ago, Kemp stood in his statehouse office fretting that bills to set the primary date in Alabama and Arkansas were not going to pass. An Alabama state party chair was worried her state would get lost in a big group, he said, but Kemp argued that Alabama would still be better off by voting when it was early enough to matter. In Arkansas, the bill to change the primary date did not pass until it was included in a special legislative session. Kemp even feared trouble in Tennessee after his counterpart there said there was a rumor circulating that the SEC Primary states were thinking about moving back by a week.  No, Kemp replied. Our coalition is holding together. WAFFLE HOUSE v. SEC PRIMARY     Kemp, 52, a boots-wearing small business owner who drives a Chevrolet Suburban with more than 430,000 miles on it, jokes he could have dubbed his effort the Waffle House primary, for a restaurant chain prevalent in the region.  But athletics jumped out as a common passion for the Southern states he helped to bring together: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. Four other states, from Alaska to Vermont, also hold contests to award delegates on Super Tuesday. Kemps plan to concentrate attention on the South did not initially excite Alabamas John Merrill, who had other priorities as that states newly elected elections chief. But after hearing the then secretary of state from Iowa - which holds the countrys first nominating contest - talk about how voters there would never back a candidate they had not met eight times, he rallied bipartisan support.  Do you know just how few times anybody in Alabama has ever had the privilege to interact with a presidential candidate on a personal basis, let alone do it more than once? Merrill said. Candidates began showing up once the regional primary was in place. A rally for Republican billionaire businessman Donald Trump drew as many as 30,000 people to a football stadium in Mobile, Alabama in August, for example. The primaries in the politically conservative South got a boost in significance this year from the size and unpredictability of the Republican presidential field. On the Democratic side, the regions large concentrations of African-American voters are seen as a test of former Secretary of State Hillary Clintons and U.S. Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders appeal with a key Democratic voting bloc. While the South has not seen such a coordinated effort in decades, it is not the first time the states have tried to gang up.  Yet in 1988, when the region almost entirely held primaries on March 8, votes were split among Democratic candidates and the contest left the South to be settled elsewhere. A number of states eventually walked away from the plan. The experience in 1988 was not one that the powers-that-be at the time really wanted, said Josh Putnam, a lecturer in political science at the University of Georgia. Nonetheless, other regions are eyeing the Southern model. Washington state Secretary of State Kim Wyman failed last year to persuade several neighboring states to coordinate their primaries but plans another push in the next cycle.  We could have a Pac-12, she joked, referring to a Pacific Coast-oriented college athletic conference. Or at least get some of the Western states to go on the same day, so candidates might actually come and visit us and campaign. ",politicsNews,"February 29, 2016 ",1
Judicial panel members consider legal brief in Apple case: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Members of the House Judiciary Committee are considering filing a friend of the court brief in Apple Incs [AAPL.O] encryption dispute with the U.S. government to argue that the case should be decided by Congress and not the courts, five sources familiar with the matter said. The sources cautioned that no final agreement had been reached on what would be an unusual intervention by congressmen in a legal proceeding. Any filing would occur after a panel hearing on Tuesday that will include FBI Director James Comey and Apple General Counsel Bruce Sewell. The court deadline is Thursday. The filing would argue that the Feb. 16 order from a federal court in California that instructs Apple to write special software to unlock an iPhone 5c used by one of the San Bernardino shooters threatens the constitutional separation of powers, the sources said. They said the brief would come from individual committee members of both Republican and Democratic parties but not the judiciary committee itself. Reuters could not determine which members were likely to be included. Lawmakers could wait until the appeals process before intervening, the sources said. Apple last week formally opposed the order in court, calling the case unprecedented and a violation of free speech rights that would override the will of Congress. On Monday, a judge in a related New York case sided with Apple in agreeing that the courts did not have the authority to order Apple to unlock a phone.  The San Bernardino case has come to represent a broader debate over how much authority law enforcement should have to compel companies to assist in monitoring digital communications.    The encryption debate does not divide along party lines, with liberal Democrats and libertarian-leaning Republicans both supporting Apples stance. Many pro-law enforcement lawmakers of both parties, and Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, support the governments position. The unusual Congressional intervention would come on top of a wave of support for Apple among its Silicon Valley brethren. Some two-dozen companies and civil liberties groups are expected to weigh in on Apples side. Relatives of some of the shooting victims are planning to back the governments case, said their lawyer, Stephen Larson.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation earlier this month sought and obtained a court order requiring that Apple write new software and take other steps to unlock an iPhone 5C that was used by Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife went on a shooting rampage on Dec. 2 in San Bernardino that killed 14 and wounded 22.  The government has said the attack was inspired by Islamist militants and the FBI wants to read data from the phone to investigate any links the couple might have had with militant groups. Apple is concerned that the order would lead to endless similar requests in the U.S. and overseas and ultimately undermine the security of all Apple phone. A number of large tech firms have publicly said they will file briefs supporting Apple. Google, Facebook and Microsoft are expected to file jointly and be represented by Neal Katyal, a Georgetown law professor and former acting U.S. solicitor general for the Obama administration, according to a source familiar with the companies plans. Amazon, LinkedIn, Twitter, the Mozilla Foundation, and the cloud storage firm Box, along with advocacy groups including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Democracy and Technology, are also expected to support Apple.  Still, some major companies, including IBM, are expected to sit out the fight. Telecom carriers have also been notably reluctant to get involved; Verizon is unlikely to file a friend of the court brief, despite comments from its CEO that the company supports encryption with no backdoors, sources familiar with the matter said.  A Justice Department spokeswoman declined comment on Sunday about what other briefs were expected. Apples high-profile standoff with the U.S. government is being played out as many of the Obama administrations most senior officials are traveling to San Francisco this week to attend the worlds largest cyber security conference.  U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, National Security Director Michael Rogers and Defense Secretary Ash Carter are all scheduled to speak at RSA conference, where the iPhone fight and encryption more broadly are expected to dominate conversation.

Attorney General Lynch says hopes Apple will comply with court order,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Monday that she hopes Apple Inc. (AAPL.O) will still comply with the court order by a federal judge in California to unlock the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.  It is still our hope that they will see their way clear to complying with that order as thousands of other companies do every day, Lynch said in an interview with Fox News. Asked about the FBIs investigation into Hillary Clintons emails, Lynch said the investigation would be done independently and refused to disclose information.  Lynch said no one outside the Justice Department, even at the White House, has been briefed on the case.  Lynch, who has been in the job as the United States top law enforcer since April 2015, waived off rumors that she might be nominated to the Supreme Court to replace late Justice Antonin Scalia.  I havent had those conversations. Im very happy with my job, Lynch repeated twice. ",politicsNews,"February 29, 2016 ",1
Court hears appeal of ruling in Menendez corruption case,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - The U.S. Constitution protects Sen. Robert Menendez from being prosecuted on bribery charges for talks he held with government officials on behalf of a friend who gave him gifts valued at $1 million, the New Jersey Democrats lawyers argued on Monday. The arguments came before the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the corruption case against Menendez, who stepped down as the ranking member of the powerful U.S. Foreign Relations Committee when he was indicted in April 2015.  Federal prosecutors charge that he accepted lavish stays at a Caribbean villa, a luxurious visit to a Paris hotel and flights on private jets from Florida ophthalmologist and businessman Solomon Melgen, a longtime friend. Menendez interceded on Melgens behalf in an $8.9 million billing dispute with Medicare, and in a dispute with the government of the Dominican Republic over a port security contract held by one of Melgens companies, prosecutors say. The hearing on Monday involved an appeal of an earlier ruling dismissing a motion by Menendezs lawyers to have the case thrown out before it goes to trial. They argued that the discussions with high-level officials centered on government policies rather than Melgen himself. At the time of his indictment, Menendez was the ranking member of the powerful U.S. Foreign Relations Committee, a post that he stepped down from while the charges are pending. You have to look at what happened in the room, defense attorney Abbe Lowell told the three-judge panel hearing the case. If you look at what happened in the room, the record reflects that there were high level policy discussions occurring. The case highlights a seldom-discussed provision of the U.S. Constitution known as the speech or debate clause, which gives members of Congress broad protections against prosecution for actions they take in their capacity as legislators. The clause was designed to prevent the executive branch from intimidating members of Congress for legislative actions, but it is commonly cited by the legal teams of members of Congress when they run afoul of U.S. corruption laws. But Circuit Judge Thomas B. Ambro pointed out that not everything a member of Congress does is protected by the clause. It looks like hes doing constituent services, and that doesnt get you the shield of the speech and debate clause, Ambro said. Prosecutors argued that the justices should look at the circumstances surrounding the talks Menendez held with government officials. Peter Koski, the deputy chief of the U.S. Justice Departments Public Integrity Section, pointed to emails between Menendez and his chief of staff in which they discuss whether a meeting with then-U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius would get Melgens hopes up. The only way Melgens expectations would be raised is if that meeting were about him, Koski said. Melgen and Menendez have pleaded not guilty, and have challenged the charges against them.  In September, U.S. District Judge Benjamin Walls dismissed some of the charges against the men related to allegations that Melgen passed along $40,000 in bribes with contributions through Menendezs legal defense fund.

Judge blocks Indiana governor's order barring Syrian refugees,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday blocked Indiana Governor Mike Pences order barring state officials from helping Syrian refugees resettle in the state, saying it was discriminatory. Pence was among more than 25 U.S. governors, mostly Republicans, who called on President Barack Obama to stop resettling refugees fleeing Syrias civil war after November attacks by militants in Paris that killed 130. Governors have cited concerns that some refugees could be associated with Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the attacks. The suit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of Exodus Refugee Immigration Inc was among the first challenging governors moves to block resettlement. The States conduct clearly discriminates against Syrian refugees based on their national origin, U.S. District Judge Tanya Walton Pratt said in a ruling granting the preliminary injunction. She added that withholding federal grant money from Exodus did not advance Indiana officials assertions that they were barring refugees for safety reasons. Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller plans to appeal the decision and will seek a stay of Pratts order, a spokesman for the attorney generals office said in a statement. The ACLU had contended that decisions on immigration and refugee resettlement were exclusively the province of the federal government and could not be dictated by state officials. Indiana had argued that Exodus, a nonprofit that gets federal money to resettle refugees, lacked standing to assert refugees rights. The U.S. State Department said in November that a refugee family that had been headed to Indiana was relocated to Connecticut, but did not specify the familys country of origin. After the Paris attacks, the Obama administration stood by its pledge to admit some 10,000 refugees to the United States over the following year. Refugee advocates have noted that candidates for resettlement go through extensive background checks, taking up to two years, before reaching the United States. ",politicsNews,"February 29, 2016 ",1
Wife of 'American Sniper' making waves in Texas Republican politics ,"FORT WORTH, Texas (Reuters) - The widow of a slain Navy SEAL whose story was turned into the hit movie American Sniper has become a prominent figure in Fort Worth Republican politics even though her name does not appear on Tuesdays primary ballot. Taya Kyle, the wife of Chris Kyle, is campaign treasurer for a Republican opponent of longtime Tarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson, the lawman seen as the face of the manhunt for affluenza teen Ethan Couch. Kyle is also in a dispute with her late husbands former business partner Bo French, who is running as a Republican for a Texas House of Representatives seat from the same county.  Lawyers for Kyle sent a cease-and-desist letter to the French camp last week calling on it to stop using her husbands name and likeness in campaign materials. Bo (is) abusing the name of my late husband, a beloved Son of Texas, and a hero to the nation, in an attempt to manipulate voters, Kyle said in a statement on social media. She did not respond to requests to speak about her political activism. Her experience with public exposure and scrutiny has taught her not to let her guard down, said Republican political strategist Bill Miller. Shes become a very formidable woman. Chris and Taya Kyle have become stars of the states Republican establishment, with Governor Greg Abbott setting up a day to honor the memory of Chris Kyle, who was killed in 2013 by a troubled veteran he was trying to mentor.  Taya Kyle last year endorsed former Governor Rick Perry in his unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination. She now endorses U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.  In the sheriffs race, she may be the difference in the campaign of Bill Waybourn, a former suburban Fort Worth police chief, analysts said. Waybourn, backed by the conservative Tea Party movement, is challenging Anderson, a fellow Republican, who gained national attention in calling for the apprehension of Couch. The teen, whose lawyer said his wealth distorted his moral compass, fled to Mexico in December apparently to avoid apprehension for violating the probation deal that kept him out of jail for a drunken driving wreck in 2013 that killed four people. Kyle, 41, has not indicated any intention to seek elective office, but analysts said that should not be ruled out. Once someone gets involved and gets their hands wet in politics, its hard to get out, Miller said. ",politicsNews,"February 29, 2016 ",1

Obama adviser Deese to lead White House's Supreme Court process,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama has turned to senior adviser Brian Deese, an economic expert who previously led the administrations climate change efforts, to head a team formed to pick a Supreme Court nominee and win confirmation, the White House said. White House counsel Neil Eggleston will be a part of that team and will steer the legal process, including the vetting of potential candidates, administration officials said on Monday. Leading Republicans have vowed to block any nominee Obama chooses, leaving the White House with the challenge of finding someone it believes could change Republican minds or galvanize enough public support to pressure them to back down.  Obama has been in the early stages of choosing a candidate to replace conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia since his death two weeks ago.  The process is likely to take at least a month, and the Deese-led team was created to ensure the entire White House staff was not consumed with the potentially legacy-defining project. The group will report regularly to chief of staff Denis McDonough, senior advisers and Obama. Deese has a history of taking on projects important to the president within the White House. He was involved in leading the administrations bailout of the U.S. auto industry, budget deals with Congress and, most recently, international climate change talks that culminated in a Paris deal to fight global warming. The president has relied on Brian in a variety of critical situations to do important work and to take on important projects, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.  Given Brians performance in his other priorities, I dont think its particularly surprising he would be tapped for this responsibility too. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said repeatedly that the Senate will not confirm an Obama nominee in this election year. McConnell and other congressional leaders are scheduled to meet with the president on Tuesday. The White House keeps an ongoing list of potential candidates for the Supreme Court for instances in which a vacancy opens up, according to a former administration official involved in the process previously. That list is now being reviewed and is open to new entrants. Candidates will be vetted and interviewed before Obama makes his final decision. ",politicsNews,"February 29, 2016 ",1

Connecticut cancels pay raises for managers as budget woes bite,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Connecticut will cancel pay raises for managers at state agencies after the latest projections suggest the states fiscal situation may be much worse than previously thought, top officials said on Monday. The canceled raises are an early indication of the harm done by the states fiscal crisis. Many more cuts are expected this year as officials struggle with a budget deficit that could be as high as $900 million in the coming fiscal year. Although high-profile, the amounts involved are largely symbolic. The cancellations will affect 1,950 employees and represent savings of $12.74 million over two years. The figure does not include pay freezes in the judicial branch.  Connecticut has had to slash its revenue forecast because the weak stock market is cutting into capital gains tax receipts, which play a large role in the budget. It also met resistance when it tried to raise taxes. General Electric moved its headquarters out of the state earlier this year.   We have a responsibility to the taxpayers of Connecticut not to move forward with managerial raises at a time when so many state programs will see reductions and while many state jobs are likely to be eliminated, wrote Ben Barnes, secretary of the Office of Policy and Management. The letter was co-signed by Brian Durand, chief of staff to Democratic Governor Dannel Malloy. A report last week from the non-partisan Office of Fiscal Management said the deficit could be as high as $900 million in the next fiscal year, which begins on July 1. An earlier estimate from Barnes office put the deficit at $570 million.    Most of the raises, which have already been postponed twice, would have been awarded on Friday. They will be suspended indefinitely. ",politicsNews,"February 29, 2016 ",1
Republican Cruz taps homeschool niche in battle for Texas,"(Reuters) - If Republican Presidential hopeful Ted Cruz lands a win in the nominating contest in his home state of Texas on Tuesday, part of the credit will go to support from a small and often overlooked interest group: homeschoolers. The Senators campaign has invested months of effort courting the well-organized network of families who educate their children at home - often to avoid constraints on religion in public school - in the hopes they can keep a big chunk of conservative voters away from his rivals, billionaire Donald Trump and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. They were crucial to our win in Iowa and will be in Texas (as well), said Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier, referring to Cruzs only victory in a string of four contests for the partys presidential nomination so far that have otherwise been swept by Trump.  The Cruz campaign has used its message of religious liberty and small government to draw some 6,670 members to its Homeschoolers for Cruz coalition in recent months - many of whom campaign on his behalf.  One thing to understand about homeschoolers is we are all networked, said Ken Cuccinelli, a member of Homeschoolers for Cruz and an occasional campaign surrogate.  He said the group has used email pleas, door-knocking, and old-fashioned word-of-mouth to win votes. The real rock stars are the teenagers. They have so much energy... And work ethic. They just churn through work like us old people dont.     Cruzs campaign is betting that support like that will help him secure a win in Texas - the biggest prize among the 12 states holding Republican nominating contests on Super Tuesday. Texas has 155 delegates and a big win for Cruz could potentially shift the balance of the race to decide who will be the Republican nominee at the Nov. 8 presidential election. Trump currently has 82 delegates to Cruzs 17. Only around 3.5 percent of schoolchildren in the United States are homeschooled. But the families that endorse homeschooling can have outsized political influence in some states and are often conservative.  Many proponents of homeschooling share two important traits: a bent toward religion and a tendency to carefully guard against education policy changes that could affect them personally. (Cruz) is going to make sure that the federal government will not infringe on what we believe is our God-given right, said Will Estrada, a Virginia-based co-chair of Homeschoolers for Cruz and a lawyer at the Home School Legal Defense Association - which does not typically endorse candidates before the general election. Homeschoolers help candidates tap into the evangelical vote, long thought to be Cruzs firewall in Southern states, even though he has struggled to win the conservative Christian vote amid the challenge by Trump.  Cruz leads Trump in Texas, 36.2 to 26.6 percent, according to a RealClearPolitics poll average, one of few leads predicted for the Texas senator for March 1 contests.      The stakes are high for Cruz on Tuesday. At a recent presidential forum at Regent University in Virginia, also a Super Tuesday state, Cruz warned that a runaway victory for Trump could make the billionaire businessman unstoppable.          Marlin Bontrager, a homeschooler parent whose family gospel band tours the country by bus, said hes supporting Cruz in part because he worries that secular education has contributed to a drop in the American intellect and the rise of Trump, as well. Our educational system has(...) dumbed down our society. And were seeing the effect of that this election,he said, referring to the broad support for Trump.  In 2008, homeschoolers in Iowa mobilized around then-Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee, helping him win the state.

Trump naysayers push #NeverTrump on Twitter before Super Tuesday,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The use of the #NeverTrump hashtag grew on Twitter on Monday as detractors of Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump fretted over his momentum on the eve of Super Tuesday election contests. On Twitter, the top influencer, or person who received the most engagement on their #NeverTrump tweets, was Trump rival Marco Rubio, according to online research firm Hashtagify.me. The senator from Florida and real estate billionaire Trump are engaged in an increasingly personal battle of insults on social media before voters in more than a dozen states select their partys nominee to run for the White House in November. Rubio began using the tag on Friday, tweeting: Donald Trump is a con artist - and he cannot be our nominee. #NeverTrump. The tweet received more than 8,000 likes and 5,100 retweets. He repeated the tag in three more tweets over the weekend, with each one getting several thousand likes or retweets. A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign did not immediately return calls for comment. Another major influencer on the tag was conservative commentator Glenn Beck (@glennbeck), even though he has used it just once, on Sunday. Beck supports U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the campaign.  Still, Becks post - Praying for this great country. Praying for a true constitutionalist! God bless (an emblem for the American flag). #NeverTrump #CruzCrew - proved influential, getting retweeted nearly 1,000 times and liked nearly 2,000 times. Traffic on the hashtag was dominated by users who identify as conservative or Republican, most expressing vexation with the front-runner. Many tweets focused on Trumps CNN interview on Sunday, when he declined to repudiate an endorsement from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. Trump later said he did not hear the question properly because of a defective ear piece.  Whitney Westerfield (@KyWhitney), a Republican state senator from Kentucky, tweeted on Monday, Wow. Trump blaming his failure to repudiate the hatred & extremism of the KKK on a #BadEarpiece. #NeverTrump. No, the white supremacist/David Duke/KKK question isnt hard. Reject their support & denounce their hate. Again & again & again. #nevertrump, said Stephen Hayes (@stephenhayes), a writer for the Weekly Standard, a weekly conservative magazine. Trump supporters have countered with their own hashtag: #AlwaysTrump. We must continue to fight on social media, the Peoples Revolution, the strongest tool right now! #TRUMP2016 #AlwaysTrump, wrote Trump supporter Linda Alexander (@noopdoggy). Still, the #NeverTrump hashtag was winning the trending battle, seeing roughly twice the traffic as #AlwaysTrump on Monday, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph.

U.S. sentencing reform backers cite success at state level,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As the Senates top Republican mulls whether to push ahead on a criminal justice reform package, the bills advocates say its power to cut crime is on display in his own back yard. Mitch McConnell, the Senates Republican leader, represents Kentucky, one of a handful of states that have had some success with sentencing reform and reducing violent crime. Violent crime rates are down nationwide since President Barack Obamas first term, but states such as Kentucky have seen it fall more steeply than the national rate. Kentuckys imprisonment rate also declined after it reduced sentences for certain drug offenders and passed a policy to release some prisoners to community supervision before the end of their sentences in 2011. The policy saved the state more than $29 million over two-and-a-half years, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts, a policy research group. McConnell could move forward in the Senate with a reform measure that would lower mandatory minimum sentences for some nonviolent federal drug offenders and permit judges to rehear cases with those new sentences in mind. It is backed by the Obama administration and a bipartisan group of 30 senators. The federal measure has been informed by success stories in states that have passed similar laws over the past decade, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told Reuters.  Im confident that we would see similar results if Congress were to pass important reforms at the federal level, she said. McConnell in January vowed to bring everybody in the Republican Conference up to speed... before any decision is made about floor time since the bill has so far been discussed mainly in the Senate Judiciary Committee. McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said he had no new announcements on the bills prospects for advancement. Some Republicans oppose it, such as Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, who says parts of the proposal applying to armed drug offenders would release thousands of violent felons. But sponsors of the Senate package cite state-level success in arguing for the federal reforms. While I am excited about our federal prospects, the fact is that we could not have gotten to this point if it were not for the great reforms that Utah and other red states around the country are enacting, Republican Utah Senator Mike Lee told Reuters, referring to states that predominantly support the Republican Party. Thirty states reduced crime and imprisonment rates simultaneously between 2009 and 2014, Pew said, with 18 of those states crime rates falling faster than the national rate. Utah last year lowered penalties for certain drug offenses. It also restricted prison beds to only the most serious offenders through a law the state expects to nearly flatline prison growth over the next 20 years and save $542 million. The U.S. Sentencing Commission estimates more than 12,000 prisoners - about six percent of the federal prison population - would be eligible to have their cases reheard under the Senate bill. A parallel package of bills in the House of Representatives also awaits a floor vote.  Earlier this month, Justice Action Network hired McConnells former chief of staff, Hunter Bates, to lobby for the bill. Bates told Reuters that McConnell is not quite ready to advance the bill yet, but that it is on a short list of bills that have a shot at becoming law in 2016. ",politicsNews,"February 29, 2016 ",1
Sanders supporters' courtship of Clinton superdelegates may be backfiring,"(Reuters) - Backers of Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders have launched a campaign to win over some of his rival Hillary Clintons most prized supporters - the superdelegates that can make the difference in a tight race for the partys nomination. But some emails, phone messages, and petitions sent by the Sanders boosters have backfired, upsetting superdelegates with their aggressive tone and leading many to dig in their heels for Clinton, according to interviews conducted by Reuters. The drive to flip Clintons super delegates has not been sanctioned by Sanders campaign, his spokesman Michael Briggs said. Bernies campaign is focused on reaching out to all voters and earning delegates at primaries and caucuses, he said in a statement, stressing that the Sanders campaign was not coordinating with supporters to contact superdelegates.  However, the unofficial push could complicate the U.S. Senator from Vermonts efforts to woo the critical bloc in the coming months.  The effort has at times taken an angry tone, some of the messages reviewed by Reuters showed, reflecting the anti-establishment tinge of the 2016 presidential race where many voters are unhappy with Washington insiders. Some 85 percent of the 4,763 delegate votes to the Democratic National Convention that will decide who will face a Republican rival in the November election are determined by the results of states nominating contests. But the remaining 15 percent are held by superdelegates, who get to vote however they like - meaning they could hold the key to a tight contest. Superdelegates are made up of party leaders and elected Senators, members of Congress, and governors. The Democratic party adopted the system in the early 1980s as a way of giving party leaders more control over the nominating process, though they have yet to play a decisive role in a nomination. The idea there is that youve got people who have a long view ... who have, arguably, the best interests of the party at heart, said Terri Fine, a professor of political science at the University of Central Florida.  At least one superdelegate who has backed Sanders, however, finds the system that can overturn the will of regular voters flawed. Im a superdelegate to fight to end superdelegates, said Larry Cohen, a former president of the Communications Workers of America union who volunteers full-time for the Sanders campaign.  Among super delegates that have tipped their hand so far, Clinton holds 453 to 20 for Sanders, according to the New York Times delegate tracker. Among regular delegates, won through nominating contests, Clinton leads by 91 to 65 after the South Carolina primary. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1QHZCSj ) The Republican party does reserve slots for members of its national leadership, but they do not have such influence as Democratic superdelegates. Interviews with 10 of the 505 super delegates supporting Clinton Reuters has reached show that nine of them have been approached by people purporting to back Sanders, and nearly all were displeased by the tone of the outreach. Isabel Framer of Ohio, a superdelegate for Clinton, for example, got a voice mail last week urging her to vote for Sanders in accordance with the will of the people.  On the voice mail, heard by Reuters, the anonymous male caller says: I think its crap that you get to vote whichever way you want... Ill be watching your vote.  Im not easily frightened, Framer told Reuters. Im not going to change a vote over threats.  Akilah Ensley, a North Carolina superdelegate, said she started hearing more often from Sanders supporters after her name appeared on a Wikipedia list noting her support for Clinton. Some of them were nice, and some were rather abrasive, she said, adding attacking my decisions is probably not the best way to change her mind.  Luis Heredia, an Arizona superdelegate for Clinton, said he has received over 30 phone calls, emails and instant messages from Sanders supporters. The majority of them are more angry, and the tone is more demanding, Heredia said.  Lacy Johnson, an Indiana superdelegate backing Clinton, meanwhile, said he had received a mix of messages, including one that he said threatened: we will make you pay. Andres Ramirez, a political consultant in Las Vegas, Nevada, and a superdelegate supporting Clinton, said in the past campaigns would typically try to soft-sell their candidates rather than use pressure tactics. The way this has gone down, in my experience, has never happened before, said. While it is unclear who is directing some of the calls and emails to Clintons superdelegates, Seattle resident Justin Renquist has pushed for some of the outreach, although he stressed that such contacts needed to be civil. Renquist calls  himself part of the Superdelegate Task Force Army that rallies Sanders supporters to reach superdelegates via Facebook, Twitter and other means. There are 3,000 in my group who have been slamming these guys as politely and nicely as we can...basically saying, look this system is undemocratic, Renquist said.  On Friday, the group issued a statement saying it did not support, condone or engage in any communication with superdelegages that was vulgar, threatening, harassing or intimidating. Other Sanders fans, meanwhile, have gathered more than 300,000 signatures under at least two petitions on MoveOn.org, asking superdelegates to vote in line with the results of the primaries and caucuses.  A third petition, on the Democracy for America site, also asks superdelegates to follow state nominating contests. It was started by Robert Reich, who was a secretary of labor under Bill Clinton and who has endorsed Sanders. The Sanders campaign plans its own effort to win over superdelegates, possibly in April.  Thats when well make a much stronger approach to superdelegates, said Tad Devine, a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign.  Clintons campaign, meanwhile, started officially courting superdelegates months ago. We are proud to have the support of these Democratic party leaders, who have been in the trenches, said Jesse Ferguson, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign.

"Clinton sets sights on Trump, general election after huge win in South Carolina","COLUMBIA, S.C. (Reuters) - Riding high after a landslide victory in Saturdays South Carolina primary, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has set sights on a possible face-off in the Nov. 8 presidential election with Donald Trump, the favorite for the Republican nomination.  Despite what you hear, we dont need to make America great again. America has never stopped being great, she told supporters in her victory speech in South Carolina, declining to mention Trump by name, but taking a jab at his campaign slogan, Make America Great Again. Clinton said she was not taking anything for granted after crushing Democratic rival Bernie Sanders on Saturday by 48 percentage  points, likely setting herself up for a good Super Tuesday night on March 1, a key date in the nomination battle. But if Clinton and Trump win big on Tuesday as opinion polls suggest, the chance of a general election matchup between them increases, adding another twist to a presidential campaign that has defied convention as U.S. voters vent frustration over economic uncertainty, illegal immigration and national security threats. Some Clinton backers, emboldened by the heightened chance of a Trump nomination, have reaffirmed their support for the former secretary of state, saying that it is she, not Sanders, who is best equipped to take down Trump in a head-to-head showdown in November. Rosilyne Scott, 58, of Texas, cast her vote early for Clinton ahead of Texass upcoming Tuesday nominating contest, calling the prospect of a Trump presidency frightening. I just think she has more support, and shes been doing it a lot longer, she said.  If you get someone like Donald Trump in, I dont know. ... I think hes a joke, a bigot, a racist. Amid Clintons renewed momentum against Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, donors have also found resolve. One Clinton fundraiser in California said her recent victories in Nevada and South Carolina have prompted more people to donate to her campaign and to attend Clinton events. He said he had raised $10,000 for the Clinton campaign in the past week alone.  A Trump-Clinton election would embody the outsider-versus-establishment battle in American politics. Trump has never been elected to public office, while the former first lady has been a player in Washington for decades.   South Carolina was Clintons third victory in the first four Democratic contests, raising more questions about whether Sanders, a democratic socialist, will be able to expand his support beyond his base of predominantly white liberals. Exit polls showed Clinton winning big in the state with almost every constituency. She won nine of every 10 black voters, as well as women, men, urban, suburban, rural, very liberal and conservative voters. Sanders was ahead among voters between ages 18 and 29, and among white men. When asked which candidate they thought can win in November, an overwhelming 79 percent said Clinton, with only 21 percent putting their faith in Sanders to defeat the eventual Republican nominee. Sanders, who has energized the partys liberal wing and successfully courted many of the partys youth, on Sunday acknowledged he had been decimated by Clinton in South Carolina. He set his sights on March 1, where a win in a key state is crucial to keeping his hopes alive. I think were going to do well on Super Tuesday, were going to do well in many states after that and we look forward to those state-by-state struggles, he said in an interview on NBC Newss Meet the Press. But Sanders needs to have his breakout moment sooner rather than later, warned longtime Democratic activist Phil Noble, who said that Sanders momentum in South Carolina fell off the table after Clintons solid victory in Nevada on Feb. 20.      Hes got to pull off a surprise against Clinton soon or he wont have time to recover, he said.

Tech CEO Whitman calls Trump 'unfit' to be U.S. president,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Meg Whitman, the head of technology firm Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE.N), said on Sunday that Donald Trump was unfit for the U.S. presidency, and criticized New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, whose failed presidential bid she supported, for endorsing him. But, later in the day, Trump picked up another high-profile endorsement, from U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a leading conservative. Trumps insurgent campaign has riven the Republican Party, with party leaders openly discussing how to thwart the will of the tens of thousands of members who have voted for Trump, helping him comfortably win in three of the four states that have so far held nominating contests. Party leaders are nervous that Trump, a billionaire real-estate developer from New York City who deviates from some of the central tenets of Republican conservatism, may alienate voters if he is their candidate in the Nov. 8 general election. He has proposed banning Muslims from entering the United States and declined a journalists invitation on Sunday to condemn the Ku Klux Klan, the violent white-supremacist group. Christie, who scrapped his own presidential bid earlier this month, became the most prominent Republican figure to break ranks with party leadership by endorsing Trump on Friday ahead of this weeks Super Tuesday contests, when voters in 11 states go to the polls. Whitman, who was a co-chairwoman of the national finance committee of Christies campaign, said in a statement to reporters that Trump would take the country on a dangerous journey and that Christie was aware of this. Chris Christies endorsement of Donald Trump is an astonishing display of political opportunism. Donald Trump is unfit to be president, said the statement from Whitman, who is chief executive and president of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and chairman of HP Inc (HPQ.N). She called on Christies donors not to follow him to Trump, who has predominantly funded his campaign with personal loans. Representatives of Christie and Trump did not respond to requests for comment. Earlier on Sunday, Trump was asked repeatedly if he would unequivocally condemn the Klan and other support from white supremacists. I dont know anything about what youre even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists, Trump told CNNs Jake Tapper after being asked about his endorsement by David Duke, a former Klan leader. If you would send me a list of the groups, I will do research on them and certainly I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong. Previously, Trump had seemed less uncertain about his views on Duke. David Duke endorsed me? he said in a response to a reporter. Alright. I disavow. OK?  His latest backer, Senator Sessions, has had to defend his own controversial comments about the Klan in the past. In 1986, he admitted during an unsuccessful confirmation hearing to become a federal judge that he had said he thought the Klan was OK until he came to believe that some members smoked marijuana. He explained that these remarks were a joke and has since called the Klan destestable.     In a separate interview on Sunday, Trump also defended posting on his Twitter account a quote sometimes attributed to Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini. He told NBC News he did not realize that the quote - It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep - was associated Mussolini but said it did not matter because it was a good aphorism all the same. Many party leaders hope U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida will somehow overtake Trump before the partys nominating convention in July, despite Rubios not having won any states and lagging behind in Trump in opinion polls.  In recent days, Rubio has taken to adopting Trumps habit of using adolescent insults to denigrate his rival, suggesting on Friday that Trump urinated in his trousers during last weeks televised debate. Rubio and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the only Republican to yet beat Trump in a primary election, both criticized Trumps reticence to speak ill of the Klan on Sunday. We cannot be a party that nominates someone who refused to condemn white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan, Rubio told a crowd of voters in Purcellville, Virginia, MSNBC reported.

Exclusive: Democratic Party slams GOP candidates on climate change,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Democratic Party released a video on Sunday slamming Republican presidential hopefuls for their opposition to action on climate change, suggesting the views clash with the reality of rising sea levels and shifting weather patterns. The video features Republican front-runner Donald Trump and his two closest rivals, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, denying man-made global warming, juxtaposed with images of U.S. flooding, wildfires, droughts and heat waves. Im not a believer in climate change, Trump says during a television news interview featured in the clip. The video can be seen at bit.ly/1Qm5iB8.  Satellite data show theres been no warming whatsoever, Cruz, a U.S. senator of Texas, says in another news clip. Rubio, a U.S. senator of Florida, says, I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it.     The video aims to put the environmental issue center stage in the November race for the White House.      Democratic presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have both laid out plans to combat climate change, while all five Republican presidential contenders have argued that the problem doesnt exist or have discounted the scope of the issue. The video also draws a link between environmental issues and the vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court following the surprise death this month of Justice Antonin Scalia.  President Barack Obama has said he plans to nominate a replacement for Scalia before the November election, but Republicans in Congress have vowed to block the effort. With so many issues at stake now, with so much potentially heading before the court on clean energy and climate change, we simply cant afford for our nations highest court to be crippled, a few Democratic members of Congress say in the video. An official for the Democratic Party said the video would be circulated on social media.

"Congresswoman quits Democratic National Committee, endorses Bernie Sanders","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic National Committee Vice Chair Tulsi Gabbard resigned from her post on Sunday to endorse Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, following months of rising tensions within the group. I think its most important for us, as we look at our choices as to who our next commander in chief will be, is to recognize the necessity to have a commander in chief who has foresight, who exercises good judgment, Gabbard, a U.S. representative for Hawaii, said on NBCs Meet the Press. Gabbard, one of five vice chairs, and her committee colleagues have butted heads over a thin debate schedule in the months leading to Democratic voting contests for the partys nomination, with Gabbard calling for the group to add more debates to the calendar. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is competing with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination to run for president on Nov. 8. Critics have said the scheduling of the debates has favored Clinton, who is better known than Sanders and is favored to win the nominating contest. Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued a statement accepting Gabbards resignation, calling her a friend and praising the active-duty veteran for her service in the armed forces. Congresswoman Gabbard is a role model who embodies the American ideal that anyone can dream big and make a difference, Wasserman said in the statement.  She is also a colleague in Congress and a friend, and I look forward to continuing to work alongside her when our Party unites behind whoever emerges as our nominee.

Former Christie campaign finance chair slams Christie endorsement of Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former finance co-chair of Chris Christies presidential campaign on Sunday slammed Christies recent endorsement of Donald Trump, according to NBC, calling for the New Jersey governors supporters to reject the Republican front-runner.  Chris Christies endorsement of Donald Trump is an astonishing display of political opportunism. Donald Trump is unfit to be president, Meg Whitman, chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard, said in a statement reported by NBCs Meet the Press program. Christie, appearing on ABCs This Week program, responded by describing Whitman a great friend with a different political opinion. And thats OK. Thats what makes this country great is that people can have differences of political opinion, he said.   Just days before the Super Tuesday nominating contests, Christie on Friday became the most prominent mainstream Republican to get behind the billionaire Republican front-runner and former reality TV star, declaring Trump to have the best chance of defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. But Whitmans statement said the New Jersey governor made his statement despite his own public misgivings about a Trump presidency. Trump would take America on a dangerous journey. Christie knows all that and indicated as much many times publicly, Whitman said. Trumps unorthodox candidacy has shaken the Republican Party and has drawn increasingly vehement criticism from his rivals. But a growing number of senior Republicans are becoming resigned to the idea he will be their candidate in November. Christie, who withdrew his own White House bid earlier this month, denied that he reversed course on Trump after promising New Hampshire Union Leader newspaper publisher Joe McQuaid that he would not endorse him after the billionaire won the states Feb. 9 primary election. Its just not true. He called me two days after the primary and said, I was just told that youre about to endorse Donald Trump. And I said to him, thats absolutely untrue. Im not about to endorse anybody, Christie told ABC.  (Reporting by Alana Wise and David Morgan; Editing by Ros Russell) This article was funded in part by SAP.

"Republicans Rubio, Cruz release taxes, piling pressure on Trump","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz  released tax returns for several years on Saturday in an effort to pressure billionaire front-runner Donald Trump to follow suit. Rubio, whose financial decisions earlier in his life have come under scrutiny, paid $78,917 in taxes on $335,561 in gross income in 2014, along with his wife, Jeanette. Cruz paid $389,124 in taxes on $1.2 million income in 2014 along with his wife, Heidi, who is employed by Goldman Sachs and currently on leave from the bank.  Rubio and Cruz, both first-term U.S. senators, trail Trump in national polls and are fighting to stop the political novice from locking up the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election after big wins in South Carolina and Nevada. The real estate developer has said he will not release his returns until a routine audit has been completed.  If Donald is embarrassed about his tax returns, its up to the voters to assess the facts. Its time to stop delaying and come clean with the American people, Cruz said in a statement. Rubio released his last five years of federal returns on Saturday, while Cruz submitted four years. Rubio said Trump, who has promoted his success as a businessman as one of his key qualifications for the presidency, may not be as wealthy as he suggests. I think part of it is hes not as rich as he says he is, Rubio said while campaigning in Georgia. Rubio and his wife have only one debt: the mortgage on their house, the campaign said, seeking to emphasize that the senator had moved past previous financial woes. Rubio often refers to the nearly $150,000 in student loan debt he incurred by the time he graduated from law school, paid off with proceeds made from his 2012 autobiography. He also faced questions for struggling for several months in 2008 to pay the mortgage on his $384,000 South Florida home, despite a $300,000 salary from his job at a Miami law firm. Rubio also drew scrutiny for liquidating a retirement account to cover expenses, such as home repairs and school fees. That was reflected in $68,241 of income as part of his 2014 return. During his 2010 bid for the U.S. Senate, which followed his stint as a Florida state lawmaker from 2005-2006, Rubio had to defend his use of a Republican Party-issued American Express credit card for more than $7,200 personal expenses, which he later paid back.  Trump has accused Rubio of living beyond his means. Rubios adjusted gross income in 2010 was $183,826 in 2010. It spiked to $929,439 in 2012, when his book An American Son: A Memoir was published. There is no doubt the Rubio family has come a long way from the days when their largest monthly expense was a check to (student loan provider) Sallie Mae and checks were sent in the mail to pay bills with the hope the payment did not arrive before the next paycheck was deposited into their account, Rubios campaign said. Cruzs wealth, with $1.2 million in combined income with his wife in 2014, placed them well above the $423,000 threshold of the top 1 percent of earners in Texas, according to a 2015 Economic Policy Institute report.

Two former presidents of Mexico compare Trump to Hitler,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trumps political rhetoric is racist, and evocative of Adolf Hitler, former Mexican President Felipe Calderon told reporters at an event in Mexico City on Saturday.  This logic of praising the white supremacy is not just anti-immigration, Calderon said. He is acting and speaking out against immigrants that have a different skin color than he does, it is frankly racist and [he is] exploiting feelings like Hitler did in his time, Calderon said.  Trump has accused Mexico of sending rapists and drug runners across the U.S. border and has said he will make Mexicans pay for a wall on the border. Felipe Calderon was president of Mexico from 2006-12. Former Mexican President Vicente Fox, Calderons predecessor, also compared Trump to Hitler in an interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN.  He reminds me of Hitler, Fox told Cooper on Friday.  (Reporting by Joanna Zuckerman Bernstein and Luis Rojas, editing by G Crosse) This article was funded in part by SAP.

Clinton wins big in South Carolina on way to 'Super Tuesday',"COLUMBIA, S.C. (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton crushed rival Bernie Sanders at the South Carolina primary on Saturday, propelling her into next weeks crucial Super Tuesday voting in 11 states on a wave of momentum. The rout of Sanders solidified Clintons status as the strong front-runner to capture the partys nomination for the Nov. 8 election in her quest to become Americas first woman president. With nearly half of the votes counted in South Carolina, Clinton led Sanders by a 50-point margin, dramatically reversing her 28-point loss in the state to President Barack Obama during their bitter 2008 primary battle. The former secretary of states victory decisively  established her strength among black voters, a crucial Democratic constituency who make up more than half of the partys primary electorate in South Carolina. After the win, Clinton appeared to be looking ahead to a general-election matchup with Republican front-runner Donald Trump, the billionaire whose campaign slogan is Make America Great Again and has called for building a wall on the border with Mexico. Despite what you hear, we dont need to make America great again, America has never stopped being great, she told cheering supporters in Columbia after the win. Instead of building walls, we need to be tearing down barriers. The result was Clintons third victory in the first four Democratic contests, and raised more questions about whether Sanders, the democratic socialist U.S. senator from Vermont, will be able to expand his support beyond his base of predominantly white liberals. Today you sent a message, Clinton said. In America, when we stand together, there is no barrier too big to break. Sanders admitted defeat early in the night. Let me be clear on one thing tonight. This campaign is just beginning. We won a decisive victory in New Hampshire. She won a decisive victory in South Carolina. Now its on to Super Tuesday, Sanders said in a statement.              The Democratic race now becomes a broader national contest. Eleven states, including six in the South with large minority populations where polls show Clinton with big leads, will vote on Super Tuesday and four more over the next weekend. Tomorrow, this campaign goes national, Clinton said. Clintons camp was hoping a big win in South Carolina, after more narrow victories in Iowa and Nevada and Sanders clear win in New Hampshire, will set her up for a big night on Tuesday, when about 875 delegates will be up for grabs, more than one-third of those needed to win the nomination. Sanders, who has energized the partys liberal wing and brought young people to the polls with his message of attacking income equality and reining in Wall Street, needs a breakthrough win in a key state in the next few weeks to keep his hopes alive. The door is closing fast for Bernie Sanders, unaligned Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis said. Movement candidates are about momentum and excitement, and losses sap that momentum. Thats his problem right now.      Recognizing his steep odds in South Carolina, Sanders had spent most of the past week in states that will vote in March. As the results rolled in on Saturday, he was scheduled to hold a rally in the Super Tuesday state of Minnesota.

Buffett rails against presidential candidates who talk down economy,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett bemoaned the negative drumbeat on the U.S. economy from presidential candidates in his annual Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholder letter on Saturday, saying they are misleading Americans into believing their children will be worse off than they are. Its an election year, and candidates cant stop speaking about our countrys problems (which, of course, only they can solve), Buffett wrote, italicizing they for emphasis. As a result of their dour outlook on the U.S. economy, many Americans now believe that their children will not live as prosperously as they themselves do, the 85-year-old Buffett said. That view is dead wrong: The babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history, Buffett said. Buffett did not single out any presidential candidates by name. The billionaire in December officially threw his backing behind Hillary Clinton, a Democrat. During presidential elections where no incumbent is running, both sides who are running for president always say they are the ones to solve the nations problems and point out what those problems are, said Bill Smead, who invests $2.1 billion at Smead Capital Management in Seattle. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who won New Jersey Gov. Chris Christies endorsement on Friday, has offered  a bleak assessment of the U.S. economy, repeatedly saying it is in a bubble that he hopes will pop before he takes office. I dont want to inherit all this stuff, he has said. In his letter, Buffett said some commentators bemoan our current 2 percent per year growth in real gross domestic product, and, yes, we would all like to see a higher rate. But he said Americas population is growing about 0.8 percent per year, and that 2 percent GDP growth equates to a 1.2 percent per capita growth rate. That may not sound impressive, Buffett said. But in a single generation of, say, 25 years, that rate of growth leads to a gain of 34.4 percent in real GDP per capita. Buffett, whose home in Omaha, Nebraska sits on less than an acre, said society has advanced significantly since he grew up during and after the Great Depression. All families in my upper middle-class neighborhood regularly enjoy a living standard better than that achieved by John D. Rockefeller Sr. at the time of my birth, he said. His unparalleled fortune couldnt buy what we now take for granted, whether the field is  to name just a few  transportation, entertainment, communication or medical services. Rockefeller certainly had power and fame; he could not, however, live as well as my neighbors now do. All told, Buffett said it is not a good idea to listen to these presidential candidates negative outlooks.  For 240 years its been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start, he said. Americas golden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs. Americas social security promises will be honored and perhaps made more generous. And, yes, Americas kids will live far better than their parents did.

"In hard-bitten rural South Carolina, many minds made up for Clinton","DENMARK, South Carolina (Reuters) - Betty Odom-Bell, a 47-year-old entrepreneur, took a financial risk last year when she opened a restaurant in Denmark, a small town in the middle of a deeply depressed part of rural South Carolina.  So when Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton visited Denmark earlier this month promising to transform the region into a Corridor of Opportunity, Odom-Bell felt reassured. Its almost like were a forgotten town, she said, describing her surprise at Clintons visit to the town of 3,500. With her, theres a connection. I dont have that with Bernie, she said, referring to Clinton rival Bernie Sanders. Clinton is poised to win big over the U.S. senator from Vermont in South Carolinas primary contest on Saturday, in part because of her outsized support among the states rural black poor - a bloc that Sanders has struggled to impress. Interviews with residents in Bamberg and Allendale counties  show her appeal is not just about the differences in her social policies, or her widespread name recognition. It also results from her up-close campaigning style. Over the past several weeks, she has stumped in parts of the state that are off the beaten-path, reinforcing connections with audiences that stretch back decades, and peppering her speeches with the names of local leaders. Sanders in contrast, has focused his visits on South Carolinas big cities and universities, rallying large audiences with his self-styled Democratic socialist platform, while relying heavily on surrogates to do his work elsewhere. Plans offered by Sanders to address wealth inequality and improve access to education and healthcare have attracted interest, but many complain they do not feel they know him well enough to vote for him. Both of them are good candidates, but Im leaning Hillary, said Marion Roberts, a 65-year-old retiree having coffee at a fast food restaurant on Allendales main street, where many storefronts are shuttered.  Sanders talks good, but I know more about her. Allendale Countys 10,000 residents are nearly three-fourths black, and its unemployment rate, at about 9 percent, is nearly double the national average.  About a third of the countys population lives below the poverty line, making it fertile ground for candidates shopping progressive social policies.  Clintons campaign has said South Carolina will act as an early firewall against Sanders, who beat her in New Hampshires primary and posted strong showings in Iowa and Nevada, but is expected to do worse as the race shifts south.  Nationwide, Sanders has built on his popularity with young and liberal voters to narrow the race to a statistical dead heat. But Clinton still holds a massive 40 percentage point advantage among black Democrats, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Clintons advantage results in part from her husband Bill Clintons outreach to black voters during his presidency. Some voters also like that Hillary Clinton has promised to build on President Barack Obamas agenda. Allendale City Mayor Ronnie Jackson, for example, says he is backing Clinton in part because Allendale, a town of about 3,800, depends on money under an Obama administration stimulus program for impoverished communities. He hopes Clinton would continue the support. Thats the only way we can survive, he said. But he also points to differences in the way she and Sanders have campaigned. Sanders supporters have contacted him repeatedly by phone, he said, but he saw Clinton in the flesh at Denmark town hall on Feb. 12, just half an hour away. Over the summer, Clinton also hosted a listening session for local leaders, many from rural areas, and she recently won the endorsement of U.S. congressman Jim Clyburn, the only South Carolina Democrat in the House of Representatives. Sanders, meanwhile, has touted his college civil rights activism, met with black civil rights leaders and hosted an event at a historically black college. Some of those efforts have shown signs of success among young blacks. But his campaigning in rural areas has been mainly by proxy - including a visit on Monday to Allendale by campaigners organized by National Nurses United. Sanders himself moved on to other states in the run up to Saturdays primary, while Clinton continued to campaign daily there. James Fitts, an 80-year-old Allendale resident, said he likes Clintons approach. Shes been in it a long time.

Trump's obsession with WW2 generals strikes sour note with historians,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Presidential candidate Donald Trump admires the late Douglas MacArthur and George Patton, both World War Two generals. They were winners,  unpredictable, and not especially nice guys, he says in campaign speeches. But Trumps pledge to imitate their styles sets modern-day military experts on edge.  Although unquestionably in the pantheon of U.S. military heroes, MacArthur and Patton were also controversial figures remembered by historians as flamboyant self-promoters. The commander in the Pacific, MacArthur was eventually fired by President Harry Truman for speaking out against Trumans policies in the Korean War, which followed World War Two. Before Patton died in December 1945, he questioned the need to remove Nazis from key posts in postwar German politics and society. As Trump edges closer to the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election, he likely will face more pointed questions about the policy ideas behind his sweeping statements. His main Republican rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have offered far more details about their foreign policy visions as has Hillary Clinton, front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Born in 1946, a year after World War Two ended, Trump often praises MacArthur and Patton for the blunt ways he says they commanded respect. George Patton was one of the roughest guys, he would talk rough to his men, Trump told an audience last week in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. His men would die for him, Trump added. We dont have that anymore. He said Patton would wipe out Islamic State without hesitation were he still in command.  But military historians and retired generals say Trump has an inflated view of the two military men and especially their relevance to an era of modern warfare when armies rely more on technology and when battle successes and failures and civilian casualties are communicated far more rapidly than when MacArthur and Patton commanded troops 70 years ago. The candidates spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump made a habit of citing the two World War Two figures to emphasize the need to strengthen the U.S. military, talk less and do more to protect America. She declined to comment on the criticisms. She said Trump had consulted military experts, but declined to say how many, who they were or whether they were retired or active. Trump was unavailable for an interview. Interviewed by Reuters, recently retired military personnel voiced doubts about Trumps grasp of U.S. military operations. One retired four-star general called Trumps references to Patton and MacArthur bumper sticker foolishness. Another said Trump was comparing apples to oranges by likening Americas role in World War Two to the fight against Islamic State.  He has no understanding of how it works, at least in my view, said an aide to a third retired four-star general. He makes these bold statements and one-liners, but that doesnt     translate into understanding what it takes to be a military leader, what it takes to develop a plan. All three criticized as inflammatory Trumps recounting, at a Feb. 19 rally in Charleston, South Carolina, of a myth about World War One General John Pershing ordering the execution of alleged Muslim insurgents in the Philippines by shooting them with bullets dipped in pigs blood, an extra offense to Muslims because Islamic law prohibits the consumption of pork.  Trump often says that in the spirit of MacArthur and Patton, he never wants to reveal his specific plans for military operations, since that would give the enemy a chance to prepare and counterattack. I dont want my generals being interviewed, he said in Myrtle Beach.  Trumps statement had an irony about it, given his oft-repeated comment that he knows what military experts have to say from their interviews on television. But historians said the comment also showed he has little understanding of just how often MacArthur and Patton spoke to the press.  They were the media whores of their time, said Daniel Drezner, a professor at International politics at the Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy at Tufts University who often writes on national security. He said anyone vaguely familiar with Patton by way of the 1970 George C. Scott film Patton would know he got into trouble for remarks that were politically controversial.

Trump's march stirs growing sense of dread among U.S. Republicans,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republicans in Washington are coming to grips with what many of them not long ago considered an unimaginable reality: Donald Trump is likely to be their presidential nominee and standard-bearer. The prospect of Trump winning the Republican primary had been the stuff of Washington jokes, whispered hallway conversations and eye-rolls, even as he led in public opinion polls for months and dominated debate after debate. But with the brash billionaire now winning three straight contests in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, denial is giving way to a mostly gloomy acceptance that he may have too much momentum to be stopped, especially if wins big in key Southern primaries next week that look favorable to him. It fills all of us with concern and dread, said Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who has endorsed fellow Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, considered the main hope of the Republican establishment to derail Trumps march to the nomination. That march was given a boost on Friday when New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Republican presidential candidate who dropped out of the race after a dismal finish in New Hampshire, became the first major establishment Republican to endorse Trump. There is no better fighter than Donald Trump, Christie said at a news conference with Trump in Texas. Trump has vowed to scrap U.S. trade deals, slap a tariff on imported goods and raise taxes on hedge-fund managers, as well as retain some sort of mandate to purchase health insurance - clashing with the free-market principles that have long underpinned Republican economic policy.  Some Republicans in Congress, such as Flake and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said a Trump nomination would do enormous damage to the party and predicted a heavy election defeat in November to the eventual Democratic nominee. I am like on the team that bought a ticket on the Titanic after we saw the movie, said Graham, contending that Trump would be slaughtered in the general election.  In a Republican presidential debate in Houston on Thursday night, another Trump rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, challenged him on his electability, citing ties to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton such as a donation to the Clinton Foundation. Trump responded by ridiculing Cruz for his inability to win more than the early voting state of Iowa and taunted him for being behind the billionaire in opinion polls in Cruzs home state of Texas. Said Trump, If I cant beat her, youre really gonna get killed, arent you? Another Rubio supporter, Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida, told Reuters he would not back Trump if he were the nominee. If the nominee is a fraud, and someone whos offensive, and incapable of being an effective president like Donald Trump, I wont support him, Curbelo said.  Other Republicans tried to be more optimistic.  I dont think his nomination would be catastrophic, said Senator Susan Collins of Maine. She said she did not believe, as some strategists fear, that having Trump on the ballot in November would hurt Republican chances for holding onto control of the Senate, where the party currently has a 54-46 edge. Conservative economist Arthur Laffer, an adviser to former President Ronald Reagan who has been counseling Trump on tax policy, said he was convinced the real estate mogul was open to sound advice. Laffer recalled Trump telling him: Look, if youve got a better idea than Ive got, tell me, and Ill change. Senator John Thune of South Dakota suggested Trumps presence could help by bringing more voters to the polls.  Theres a lot of energy, a lot of intensity on our side,  Thune said.  Privately, lobbyists, economists, and analysts expressed deep concern about having Trump, who has proposed building a wall along the southern U.S. border and imposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, as the face of the party.  There are a lot of people who are really freaked out, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was the chief economic policy advisor to 2008 Republican presidential candidate John McCain. He seems to be winging it.  Conservative policy-makers worry that Trumps pitch to voters is based on his management skills rather than conservative principles.  Juleanna Glover, a prominent Republican communications consultant, told Reuters that Trumps ascent spells the death of the partys sentient and cohesive governing framework. Two Republican business lobbyists, who also asked to remain unidentified, told Reuters that they are very concerned about Trump, chiefly because they do not know what he stands for.  They said they have no sense of certainty because Trumps positions on issues such as tax, trade, and regulation range from being only vaguely understood to completely unknown.  By vowing to make America win again abroad while going into little detail on his foreign policy plans, Trump is also stirring concern in Washington national security circles.  A high-ranking official at a conservative think-tank, who spoke on condition of anonymity because his job requires him to steer clear of partisan politics, said: Every serious student of American strategy is sick to their stomach about the possibility of Trump being the Republican nominee.  Robert Kagan, a conservative foreign relations expert at the Brookings Institution think tank, said in a column for the Washington Post on Thursday that he would vote for Clinton rather than Trump. The party cannot be saved, but the country still can be, he wrote. Paul Ryan, the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and a leading voice on conservative economic policy, was asked Thursday whether he could work with someone like Trump if he became the nominee.  Well cross these bridges when we get to it, Ryan said. But I do believe that we will be able to unify as a party. Asked about the hand-wringing in the Republican establishment about Trump, his campaign manger, Corey Lewandowski, said, Look, weve got relationships with those guys and we talk to them all the time.  But I think what you find is that, you know, politics as usual in Washington, D.C., is not something that the American people want, he said. Lewandowski added that voters sent a very clear message in the three early voting states where Trump won nominating contests that they want someone who is going to make fundamental change. Asked if Trumps campaign would work harder to win establishment endorsements as he got closer to the nomination, Lewandowski pointed to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, an early establishment favorite who quit the race on Saturday. If endorsements mattered, he said, Jeb Bush would be the nominee.

Michigan governor's aides urged switch away from Flint River,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Quality problems prompted two of Michigan Governor Rick Snyders top lawyers to urge that Flint be moved back to the Detroit water system just months after a decision to draw water supply from the Flint River, according to emails released on Friday. Several critics have called for Snyder to resign over concerns about the states poor handling of the crisis, and the governor said Friday he felt regret every day.  Flint switched its water supply from Detroit to the Flint River in April 2014 in a bid to cut costs when the city was under a state-appointed emergency manager.  While the city switched its water source back to Detroit in October 2015, corrosive water from the river had already leached lead from city pipes, posing a serious threat to public health. Snyders aides discussed Flints water quality problems as early as autumn 2014, with one calling the situation downright scary, about a year before the switch back to the Detroit system was finally made. The Detroit Free Press and Detroit News earlier reported about the emails, which were released by the governors office. Thats where Im kicking myself every day, Snyder said after signing a $30 million supplemental bill to reimburse Flint residents for their water bills. I wish I would have asked more questions.       Snyder, scheduled to testify to Congress on March 17, has repeatedly apologized for the states poor handling of the crisis.  Liberal group Progress Michigan again called for Snyder to resign, citing the emails. Theres no reasonable person who can believe at this point that every top adviser to Rick Snyder knew that there was an issue, but Snyder knew nothing, said executive director Lonnie Scott, who also called for Snyders resignation. Valerie Brader, Snyders senior policy adviser, addressed problems over the quality of Flint River water in an email to the governors chief of staff, Dennis Muchmore, and others on Oct. 14, 2014.  She argued Flint should be returned to the Detroit water system, citing bacterial contamination and reduced quality that prompted General Motors to switch away from the river due to rusted car parts. Michael Godola, then the governors legal counsel, responded, calling the Flint River as a water source downright scary. On Friday, State Representative Sheldon Neeley of Flint asked Attorney General Bill Schuette for his legal opinion on whether an official withholding information that leads to death or harm can be charged criminally.",politicsNews,"February 26, 2016 ",1
Clinton deflects calls to release Wall Street speech transcripts,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton defended her paid speeches to Wall Street, saying in an interview that aired on Friday that they would not soften her campaign pledges for tougher regulation.  The former U.S. Senator from New York and secretary of state is under pressure from rival candidate Bernie Sanders, who has made her Wall Street ties a top campaign issue and called for her to release transcripts of her remarks. Clinton was reportedly paid millions in appearance fees after leaving the State Department. Asked whether she could assure U.S. voters that the speeches would not undermine her calls to rein in the financial industry, Clinton told MSNBC: Absolutely. Im on the public record.I told them what Im going to do. I said Im going to go after big banks that pose a systemic risk.I want you to hold me accountable for that because I will do that exactly, she told the networks Morning Joe program.  The New York Times, in an editorial late on Thursday, urged Clinton to release the transcripts, saying voters have every right to know what Mrs. Clinton told these groups. According to the paper, Clinton earned $11 million in 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 from 51 speeches to banks and other groups and industries. Clinton has said she will release copies of her remarks when other presidential candidates do the same.  On Friday, she said President Barack Obamas fundraising from Wall Street had not prevented him from enacting Dodd-Frank financial services reforms after the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  Clinton reiterated her position that regulations must go farther, saying, Dodd-Frank is great.It gives us a foundation. It doesnt go far enough.We need to look at these other entities that pose systemic risks, as well. As far as so-called unwinding of banks that pose a risk, she added: Were going to do in an orderly way so there will not be any surprises.  Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is vying with Clinton for the Democratic nomination in the November presidential election. I do not receive many millions of dollars from Wall Street or the pharmaceutical industry or other powerful, wealthy interests in this country, and have not given speeches for hundreds of thousands of dollars to Wall Street, Sanders told a Chicago rally on Thursday, the Washington Post reported. The next Democratic nominating contest is on Saturday in South Carolina.   (Reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Frances Kerry) This article was funded in part by SAP.

U.S. Supreme Court justice candidate list still open: White House,"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday that more candidates could be added to its list of potential nominees to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. We are still in a position where the list is not closed at this point, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters during a briefing. There are still people being considered for inclusion on the list of people that the president may consider for filling a Supreme Court vacancy. The White House has not officially revealed its list of potential picks to replace Scalia. Earnest said he did not expect a nominee would be named before President Barack Obama meets with congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday to discuss the matter. Scalias death left the court with four conservative and four liberal justices, meaning that Obamas nominee could tip the balance of the court to the left for the first time in decades. Republicans, who control the Senate, have said the seat should remain vacant until Obamas successor takes office next January so voters could have a say in the selection when they choose a new president in the Nov. 8 election. But Obama has vowed to press ahead with nominating a justice. Earnest said the White House would seek the help of former administration officials to coordinate outside activist groups in the fight over filling the vacancy. The New York Times first reported on Friday that the administration was recruiting former Obama adviser Stephanie Cutter and former White House director of legislative affairs Katie Beirne Fallon to help in its campaign. We are going to draw on their contacts, and on the work theyre doing outside the administration to help us make the case, and organize the effort around the presidents constitutional responsibility to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, Earnest said.",politicsNews,"February 26, 2016 ",1
"Trump wins Christie backing, marches toward Super Tuesday","FORT WORTH, Texas (Reuters) - Republican candidate Donald Trump on Friday won the surprise endorsement of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, the most prominent mainstream Republican to get behind the former reality TV stars White House campaign. Christie said the billionaire front-runner has the best chance of beating Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election - although Clinton has yet to secure her partys nomination.  The endorsement gives Trump a further lift before next weeks Super Tuesday nominating contests. It comes just a day after he took a battering from his two main rivals at a televised Republican debate.  Trumps unorthodox candidacy has stirred controversy and shaken the Republican Party at its roots, but an increasing number of senior Republicans are becoming resigned to the idea he will be their candidate in November.      Trump is rewriting the playbook, said Christie, 53, who until two weeks ago was himself a rival for the Republican nomination. Christie dropped out after failing to muster much support for his candidacy.     Trump, 69, who has never held public office, has campaigned as a political outsider. He is riding a wave of voter anger at the slow economic recovery, illegal immigration and what he says is Americas diminishing role in the world.     The best person to beat Hillary Clinton in November on that stage last night is undoubtedly Donald Trump, Christie told a news conference on Friday, a day after the last Republican candidates debate before Super Tuesday. The debate marked a new, more aggressive approach for U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, 44, who has emerged as the Republican establishments challenger to Trump. The other main challenger at the debate was U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Trump has unsettled mainstream Republicans by winning three straight nominating contests - in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. Polls show he is likely to win big in key primaries on Tuesday. Since I started this whole thing Ive been practically Number 1, Trump said on Friday at a rally in Texas.  The 11 Republican nominating contests on Tuesday have a total of almost 600 delegates at stake, and could set Trump up to clinch the presidential nomination. Reuters/Ipsos polling data on Friday showed Trump ahead nationally in the Republican race with support at 44.2 percent, followed by Cruz at 20.7 percent and Rubio in third place at 14 percent.     On the Democratic side, former Secretary of State Clinton is battling U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Clinton and Sanders have been in a dead head over the past week, the Reuters/Ipsos data shows. Trump has vowed to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border to halt illegal immigration, called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and promised to take a tough stance on trade against China.   He was combative at a rally on Friday. He mocked Rubio, referred to violent Islamist militants as these animals and promised to defend Americans constitutional right to bear arms. Were going to build up our military, were going to knock out ISIS. Were going to knock out ISIS fast, he said, referring to the Islamic State militant group.  Wielding a water bottle as a prop, Trump made fun of Rubio for an awkward incident in which the senator grabbed for a drink of water off camera during an important televised speech in 2013.  Rubio and Cruz ganged up on Trump at Thursdays debate in Houston in a last-ditch bid to keep him from winning in states on Super Tuesday.      Rubio on Friday again took aim at Trump. Hes a con man whos taking advantage of peoples fears and anxieties about the future, portraying himself as some sort of strong guy, Rubio told reporters in Oklahoma. Hes not a strong guy. Hes never faced real adversity before. PredictWise, a research project that analyzes opinion polls and betting markets, said Trump would comfortably win among Republicans in all but one of the 11 Super Tuesday states that it measured. Cruz, 45, is likely to win in his home state of Texas, PredictWise said. Rubios home state of Florida is not part of the Super Tuesday contests. PredictIt, based out of Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, on Friday gave Trump a 73 percent chance of winning the nomination compared with a peak 75 percent chance two days earlier.      Trumps swipes at rival candidates and heated exchanges with journalists and others have for months bolstered his standing in nominating contests and opinion polls.  In a post on Twitter, Trump took aim at Rubio, a first-term senator, for his debate performance. Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a chocker (sic)! Mr. Meltdown.   Republican strategist Doug Heye said Christie may have opened the door for more mainstream Republican endorsements of a man whose chances of winning the White House were seen as next to nil a year ago.     If youre the Trump campaign this is obviously very good news and it gives permission for others to endorse. But it also makes it hard (for Trump) to make the outsider argument, he said.   Glenn Hubbard, who had been an adviser to the campaign of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and was chair of the Council of Economic Advisers during the George H.W. Bush administration, said he planned to keep up steady criticism of Trump on economic issues.  I think it is time for serious people to stand up and be counted. The next few weeks come very quickly, said Hubbard, who published a column in the Boston Globe on Friday criticizing Trump.  Hubbard, now dean of the business school at Columbia University, told Reuters he worried Trumps comments already hurt the countrys image abroad and would hobble his ability to govern if elected.

Federal judge being considered for US Supreme Court nomination: Law Journal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ketanji Brown Jackson, a federal trial judge in Washington, is being considered to fill the vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court, the National Law Journal reported on Friday, citing a lawyer who was contacted as part of the vetting process. The unidentified lawyer was contacted this week and was asked about Jacksons tenure on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in the context of her being a potential nominee for the Supreme Court, the Journal said. The lawyer described the conversation, which lasted less than 30 minutes, as a preliminary inquiry, the Journal reported. The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment on the Journal story. President Barack Obama is expected to announce a nominee in the next several weeks to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13. Scalias death left the court with four liberals and four conservatives, and Republican leaders in the Senate have vowed to block anyone Obama nominates. The Senate must confirm the nominee. Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval, a moderate Republican, took himself out of consideration for appointment to the Supreme Court this week after his name surfaced as a possible nominee. If nominated and confirmed Jackson, 45, would be the first African-American woman on the Supreme Court. She was confirmed to the federal district court in Washington in March 2013. During her confirmation hearing, she received support from U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who is related to her by marriage, the Journal reported. Jacksons husband, Patrick Jackson, is the twin brother of Ryans brother-in-law William Jackson. Jackson served as a federal public defender in Washington and then at a law firm. In 2010, she was appointed to the U.S. Sentencing Commission. ",politicsNews,"February 27, 2016 ",1
Trump and Christie laid foundation of their alliance years ago,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The political alliance sealed on Friday between Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was more than a decade in the making, the culmination of the two mens repeatedly crossing paths. Christie, a former rival for the Republican nomination for president, endorsed Trump at a surprise news conference in Fort Worth, Texas, giving the front-runner a lift ahead of the March 1 Super Tuesday nominating contests. Christie, a former federal prosecutor, told reporters his endorsement was not part of any deal that would land him a position, such as U.S. attorney general, in a possible Trump administration. Trump, 69, and Christie, 53, have been friendly dinner companions and have operated professionally in the same state. Christie has been one of New Jerseys top political figures since 2001 and Trump has been a major employer and real-estate developer in the state beginning in the 1980s when he began to run casinos in Atlantic City, the New Jersey seaside resort that had fallen on hard times and was being remade as a sort of Las Vegas of the East Coast. The close geographic ties differentiate Christie from politicians who operate farther from Trumps base in New York City, said Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University. They were bound to cross paths and come to know each other, Dworkin said. Trump sat in the front pew at a Catholic Mass celebrating Christies swearing-in for his first term as New Jerseys governor in January 2010. Hes going to be a great governor, which New Jersey could use. He will go down as the best governor there is, Trump told reporters, according to the Press of Atlantic City. Trumps sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, a federal appeals court judge, introduced the two in 2002, according to The Record of Bergen County. Christie was named the states chief federal prosecutor in 2001 by President George W. Bush. The Trumps and the Christies have often had dinner together, where Trump would do all the talking, according to American Governor, a Christie biography written by Matt Katz and published in January. Christie attended Trumps 2005 wedding, to his current wife, Melania, where Christie met Bill and Hillary Clinton, according to the book. The Christie-Trump relationship, if anything, would be socializing with big important people. Theyre both collectors, said Rutgers University senior policy fellow Marc Pfeiffer. As Christie sought to build his national profile, Trump helped. Trump gave $250,000 to the Republican Governors Association in 2014 when Christie was its head, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit that maintains a database of political donations. Representatives of Trumps casinos lobbied Christie as early as 1996 when Christie was a little-own local officeholder in Morris County, according to the Star-Ledger. The newspaper reported at the time that the county board of freeholders was considering a highway project that would affect Trumps casinos in Atlantic City. Trump founded Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc and ran casinos in Atlantic City beginning in the 1980s. He resigned as chairman before the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009, about a year before Christie became governor and took on a larger role in the citys struggles.  Trump Entertainment Resorts emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization in July 2010, with Trump acquiring a smaller stake in the company. It now runs one Atlantic City casino, the Trump Taj Mahal. Christies biggest push for development in Atlantic City was to support the Revel casino project. The Revel opened in 2012, well after Trump had reduced his holdings in Atlantic City. It closed in 2014.  Trumps presence in New Jersey could extend well beyond his career or friendship with Christie. According to media reports, he plans to be buried in the state at a private cemetery at one of his golf courses after he dies.

"Trump backing from Christie opens access to donors, mainstream advisers","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trumps endorsement from New Jersey Governor Chris Christie opens up a wide network of donors, advisers and prominent elected officials whom the billionaire has not yet been able to attract to his unorthodox bid for the Republican presidential nomination. As Trump tries to lock up the Republican nomination on Super Tuesday, Christie advisers and supporters told Reuters in interviews that he could bring much-needed financial and strategic backing.  Christies backing demonstrates that Trump will be able to bring establishment politicians into the fold, that he could raise the money necessary for a general election campaign and build a staffing operation that can rival a Democratic nominee.      The nod from Christie comes at a critical moment. On Tuesday, 11 states will vote and if Trump is able to win all or most of them, he could pull so far ahead in the competition for delegates that none of his rivals will be able to catch him. In an interview with Reuters, Christie supporter Finn Wentworth, a real estate investor and former head of the company that owns the New York Yankees, New Jersey Nets and New Jersey Devils, said he is now seriously considering backing Trump. I am a long-time supporter of Governor Christie. In that process, I have learned to respect his opinion and his judgment, Wentworth said. Hes a results-oriented person, and frankly I am now looking at Donald Trump because of Governor Christies endorsement today. Maine Governor Paul LePage, who had backed Christie initially, quickly followed in the New Jersey governors footsteps and got behind Trump - making him the second sitting governor to endorse the New York real estate mogul. Maine votes on March 5.  A senior Christie aide told Reuters he believes staff could move to the Trump campaign in the coming weeks, helping the Republican front-runner in his fledgling efforts to build a circle of advisers who could form the core of his general election campaign should he clinch the nomination. Wentworth said part of his decision-making process is that he is now convinced it is inevitable that Trump will clinch the Republican nomination. Dale Florio, a donor to Christie, said he, along with others, has a call scheduled with the New Jersey governor later on Friday. If he says, Id like you guys to support Donald Trump, Ill be there for him, Florio said. Trump has thus far avoided traditional fundraising. However, more than half of his campaign spending in 2015 was covered by money raised through the sale of his Make America Great Again hats and T-shirts, even though he told his supporters not to write donation checks. But as a nominee, that position may be impossible to stick to, especially if Clinton is the Democratic nominee and she is able to build a sizable arsenal. Christies endorsement could have the power to bring more establishment-aligned officials and donors into Trumps camp. Christie could also serve as a surrogate fundraiser. Christie is no stranger to the nations top Republican donors. In 2014, he served as the head of the Republican Governors Association, a role that largely consists of traveling the nation and raising money for Republican gubernatorial candidates. Christie was one of the most successful heads the organization has ever seen. Rob Gray, a Republican strategist who had been advising Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor who dropped out of the race last Saturday, called the endorsement a stunning surprise.  Christies endorsement is an indicator to me Trump is starting to mainstream his candidacy and that hell be able to attract a lot of mainstream experienced political leaders support if he gets the nomination, Gray said. I wasnt as sure before this. The biggest boost Christie may have offered Trump was a distraction from the coverage of Marco Rubios Thursday night debate performance and increased scrutiny in some of his business endeavors, like Trump University, a defunct venture that offered real estate investing seminars and which is currently the target of lawsuits. Both Rubio and Ted Cruz, Trumps two biggest challengers, battered away at Trump in Thursdays televised debate - the last before Super Tuesday. Im sure Rubio and Cruz at the very least had things that they wanted to do today to follow up from their narrative last night and this kind of sucked the air out, said Tom Rath, who is advising the campaign of Ohio Governor John Kasich.

Trump being advised by ex-U.S. Lieutenant General who favors closer Russia ties,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump is receiving foreign policy advice from a former U.S. military intelligence chief who wants the United States to work more closely with Russia to resolve global security issues, according to three sources. The sources, former foreign policy officials in past administrations, said retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who was chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama from 2012-2014, has been informally advising Trump.  Trump, who is leading the Republican race to be the partys presidential candidate in Novembers election, said earlier this month that he would soon release a list of his foreign policy advisers, but has yet to do so. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment about Flynn.  Flynn declined to comment when asked by Reuters whether he is advising Trump. Asked to describe his views about ties with Russia, he referred Reuters to his public statements.  The question of who has been advising Trump on national security issues has become more pertinent as prospects that the New York real estate mogul will secure the Republican nomination, possibly within weeks, have increased. Trump won the surprise endorsement of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Friday, the most prominent mainstream Republican to come on board.  Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who won popularity for his handling of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, has also been in regular contact with Trump, said a former top aide to Giuliani.  A close associate of Flynn said that Trump was not the only presidential hopeful who had consulted the former DIA chief. He responds to one and all but is not working for any one, the associate said.  Trump has struck a notably different stance on Russia from his main rivals for the nomination, calling President Vladimir Putin highly respected and advocating a warming of now icy bilateral ties.  Other Republican candidates have frequently taken to bashing Putin and have cited his military interventions in Ukraine and Syria as evidence that President Barack Obama has been weak in standing up to the Russian leader.  Trump has vowed to destroy Islamic State and to undertake an aggressive rebuilding of the U.S. military, but has signaled more flexibility than his rivals on some issues - for example, by not vowing to tear up the Obama administrations nuclear deal with Iran. Flynn resigned from his position as the head of the Pentagons main intelligence agency a year before his term was officially due to end.  Flynn raised eyebrows among some U.S. foreign policy veterans when he was pictured sitting at the head table with Putin at a banquet in Moscow late last year celebrating Russia Today, an international broadcasting network funded by the Russian government.  His son Michael G. Flynn, who acts as his chief of staff, declined comment on the banquet and on the reasons for his fathers departure from the Pentagon.  Flynn told Russia Today in an interview published on Dec. 10 that the United States and Russia should work together to resolve the Syrian civil war and defeat Islamic State.  The Obama administration has protested Russias military intervention on behalf of Syrian President Bashir al-Assad, accusing Moscow of hitting opposition forces rather than ISIS.  Right now we have essentially the U.S. strategy and we have a Russian strategy in the region that does not appear to be in line with each other. And I think we have to step back and try to figure out how do we align those, Flynn told Russia Today.  Flynn was also quoted this month as telling German magazine Der Spiegel that the Iraq war launched in 2003 by then-President George W. Bush was a mistake that gave rise to Islamic State. Trump has often strongly condemned the Iraq invasion.  A former U.S. intelligence official who worked with Flynn said the retired general believes in a more aggressive approach to U.S. interests around the world.  Hes a sharp guy, he understands foreign policy and national security and really understands intelligence, said the official. His positions and opinions are not always in line with popular thinking.  Giulianis office did not respond to a request for comment on his relationship with Trump. Randy Mastro, a New York lawyer who was a deputy mayor in Giulianis New York City administration, said Giuliani has  close ties to Trump. I know that Rudy and Donald Trump have a long-standing relationship and personal friendship that goes back many years, and they do speak to each other on a regular basis, said Mastro.

Virginia governor signs gun law compromise measures,"(Reuters) - Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe on Friday signed compromise gun legislation that recognizes concealed-carry permits from all states while making it illegal for someone under a permanent protective order to possess a firearm. McAuliffe, a Democrat, struck the deal with the Republican-controlled legislature last month. Some lawmakers and gun rights groups had objected to Attorney General Keith Herrings decision in December to stop honoring concealed-handgun permits from 25 states. Virginians elect their leaders to work together to get things done, and today I am proud to say we did just that, McAuliffe said in a statement. McAuliffe, a former Democratic National Committee chairman, called the package the biggest step forward on gun safety in more than two decades. Under the new laws, Virginia must recognize concealed-handgun permits from all other states, a rollback of Herrings stance. Virginia can confiscate firearms from anyone who is under a permanent protective order for domestic violence offenses. The legislature had rejected such measures for years. Virginia State Police also will attend gun shows to provide voluntary background checks for private sellers. Because of the compromise, McAuliffe has come under criticism from gun control advocates, including Everytown for Gun Safety, the organization founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Everytown for Gun Safety had poured money last year into Virginia, the home of the National Rifle Association gun lobby, in a failed bid to have Democrats take control of the state Senate. Reacting to McAuliffes approval of the legislation, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence praised the domestic abuse provision as a step in the right direction. But it said the concealed-carry law would let Virginians who are not eligible for a permit to circumvent it by getting a permit from another state and then carry a gun in Virginia. In addition to the public safety concerns, this new approach sends a terrible message that Virginia is unwilling to enforce its own laws, the group said. ",politicsNews,"February 26, 2016 ",1
"Obama, at battery plant, jabs Republicans on economic 'snake oil'","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama used a trip to a lithium-ion battery factory on Friday to defend his economic record against arguments made by Republicans in the race to succeed him after the Nov. 8 presidential election. Obama said his policies, including the $760 billion economic stimulus he brought in when he first took office, helped the American economy bounce back from the 2007-2009 recession that he inherited much faster than European nations that adopted austerity measures. If we dont recognize the progress weve made and how that came about, then we may chase some snake oil and end up having policies that get us back in the swamp, Obama told workers at the plant built by French company Saft with $95.5 million from the stimulus. We knew that its going to take more than one year or even one president to get to where we need to go, but we can see real tangible evidence of what a new economy looks like. It looks like this facility right here. The Saft plant, which opened in 2011, created almost 300 jobs in the region but has struggled with sluggish demand for lithium-ion batteries. The French company had to take a writedown and its chief executive has said it would probably take two to three years to become profitable. Obama acknowledged the pace of changes in the economy has been scary sometimes. Those economic fears have helped propel the campaign of Donald Trump, the billionaire businessman who is the front-runner in the race to be the Republican candidate for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Florida, home to Republican presidential candidate Senator Marco Rubio, is critical to both the March 15 primary vote and the general election that follows. Obama brought Democratic U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy from Florida with him on the trip. Murphy is running for Rubios Senate seat. Stimulus investments to advanced battery makers were panned by Republican lawmakers after A123 Systems, a lithium-ion battery maker, went bankrupt in 2012 and was bought by Chinese auto parts maker Wanxiang. Battery maker LG Chem came under fire after a 2013 Energy Department Inspector General report found that the company used some of its funding for a Michigan battery plant to pay employees to watch movies, volunteer at non-profits and play games because there was little work for them to do. But Obama said the stimulus helped America compete in the global race to boost solar and wind power. Taxpayers are getting their money back, and some, he said.

IRS identifies more cyberattacks to access tax data,"(Reuters) - The Internal Revenue Service said on Friday an investigation into a hacking attack revealed in May found that cyber criminals had made attempts to gain access to about 390,000 additional taxpayer accounts. The tax agency said 295,000 taxpayer transcripts were also targeted but access was not successful. (1.usa.gov/1Lj1iRA) The agency said in May the tax return information of about 114,000 U.S. taxpayers had been illegally accessed by cyber criminals over the preceding four months, with another 111,000 unsuccessful attempts made. The IRS then revealed in August a new review had identified 220,000 additional incidents where data was breached and another 170,000 suspected failed attempts to gain access to taxpayer data. From February to May, attackers had sought to gain access to personal tax information through the agencys Get Transcript online application, which calls up information from previous returns, the tax collection agency said in May. The nine-month long review, which looked into incidents dating back to the launch of the Get Transcript application in January 2014 through May 2015, was conducted by Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the IRS said on Friday. The Get Transcript web application has been offline since the incident was discovered, the agency said on Friday, adding that mailings to the affected taxpayers will start on Feb. 29. CNN reported in May that the IRS believed that the data theft originated in Russia.    ",politicsNews,"February 26, 2016 ",1
"Ohio mayor pleads guilty to corruption charges, remains in office","CLEVELAND (Reuters) - The mayor of Youngstown, Ohio, on Friday accepted a plea agreement on multiple political corruption charges involving a property deal made while he was a county commissioner in the area, the states Attorney Generals office said. Mayor John McNally, a Democrat, pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor counts including unlawful influence of a public official, said Daniel Tierney, spokesman for Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine. Youngstown is a city of 67,000 people about 65 miles southeast of Cleveland. The plea allows McNally, who was elected mayor in 2014, to stay in office. The conspiracy, bribery and perjury charges stem from his nine years as Mahoning County commissioner starting in 2005 until he was elected mayor.  Under Ohio law, a felony conviction bars anyone from holding most public offices for seven years. Prosecutors said McNally was part of a scheme to inflate the cost of moving the Mahoning County jobs and family services office from a rental property to benefit a local business owner.  McNally had previously been indicted on similar charges in 2010. The charges were dismissed, but the judge ruled they could be filed again at a later date. Former Mahoning County auditor Michael Sciortino and Youngstown attorney Martin Yavorcik along with McNally were part of an 83-count indictment brought in 2014 by the Ohio Attorney Generals office alleging a pattern of corruption.  Sciortino, also a Democrat, pleaded guilty to one felony count and two misdemeanor charges including receiving or soliciting improper compensation.  Sentencing for McNally and Sciortino is scheduled for March 28 in Cuyahoga County courthouse, in downtown Cleveland. McNally faces a maximum 18 months in prison, Sciortino faces a maximum of 2-1/2 years, Tierney said. In addition to the plea in a Cuyahoga County court, Sciortino agreed to plead guilty to one felony and one misdemeanor in Mahoning County court at a later date, Tierney said.  Prosecutors said Sciortino is accused of tampering with records to inflate the cost of moving the county jobs office.  Yavorcik accepted political contributions as a candidate for prosecutor in exchange for a promise to stop investigations into wrongdoing by county officials, according to the indictment. His trial is scheduled for March 14 in Cuyahoga County. ",politicsNews,"February 26, 2016 ",1
Trump vows to 'open up' libel laws if elected,"(Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said on Friday that if elected he would open up libel laws to make suing the media easier. Speaking at a rally in Fort Worth, Texas, Trump said the change was necessary to combat what he described as the dishonesty of major American newspapers. Trump routinely criticizes the press during campaign appearances, complaining about coverage he says is unfair and at times singling out people or news outlets for special insults. He often invites audiences at his rallies to boo the journalists gathered in a special fenced-off part of the room. At a Dec. 23 appearance in Grand Rapids, Michigan, he joked about killing journalists as the crowd thundered applause. One of the things Im going to do if I win, he said on Friday, Im going to open up our libel law so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money. Trump mentioned the New York Times and the Washington Post specifically and added: With me theyre not protected. Were going to have people sue like youve never been sued before. The New York businessman is leading in national polls and in most statewide polls of likely Republican voters ahead of a dozen primary contests taking place on Tuesday, a day dubbed Super Tuesday for its importance to the U.S. presidential primary process. Trump has sued journalists in the past and his representatives have not infrequently threatened to sue reporters seeking comment. In January, the Post published a story about Trumps management of the Trump Taj Mahal, a casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, that went bankrupt. In an interview published in the story on Jan. 18, Trump told the Post reporter: If you write this one, Im suing you.

Ousted Michigan lawmakers face felony charges for affair cover-up,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Two former Michigan representatives forced out of the state legislature last fall for a scheme to cover up their extramarital affair face felony charges of misconduct and related counts, officials said on Friday. Todd Courser, who resigned from his seat in Lapeer County, was charged with three counts of misconduct while in office, each of which carries a five year prison term, as well as a perjury charge, which has a 15-year sentence, according to the Michigan attorney generals office. Cindy Gamrat, who was removed from her Allegan County seat, faces two charges of misconduct while in office. Warrants have been served for both former lawmakers. We are demonstrating to the citizens of Michigan that no one is above the law, not even those who walk in the hall of power, Attorney General Bill Schuette told reporters. Schuettes office and Michigan State Police launched an investigation into the two disgraced lawmakers last fall. Schuette said on Friday that Courser and Gamrat both lied to investigators, and that Courser asked his staff to send out false emails to cover up the extramarital affair. Courser had devised a plan to distribute an email falsely claiming he had sex with a male prostitute, according to the Detroit News. That claim, Courser said, would have blunted the political impact of an actual affair if it had come out. He was charged with perjury for allegedly lying while giving testimony to a House committee, Schuettes office said. Both won seats in 2014 as Tea Party conservatives and devout Christians. They tried to regain their seats last year, but lost in the Republican primary. Courser and Gamrat were not immediately available for comment on Friday. ",politicsNews,"February 26, 2016 ",1

Exclusive: Super PACs backing Republican Cruz buy $2.4 million in ads in eight states,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Making a final push toward the crucial Super Tuesday vote, Super PACs backing Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz bought $2.4 million in advertising supporting him in eight states, the groups told Reuters.  The ads purchased by Keep The Promise and its various offshoots include radio, television and online and are the latest effort by supporters of Cruz, a U.S. senator of Texas, to dislodge Donald Trump from the front-runner position in Tuesdays critical 11-state Republican nominating contests. Should Trump sweep the contests, it could make stopping his path to the Republican nomination impossible. The outside groups supporting the presidential candidates have already spent more than $5.5 million on advertising in Super Tuesday states, according to analysis by Reuters of the spending reports filed with Federal Election Commission as of Friday morning.  Super PACs are permitted to raise unlimited amounts of money from individuals and corporations, but are prohibited from coordinating with the campaigns they are supporting. Most of the Super PACs have been used to fund expensive advertising budgets, while the campaigns themselves are responsible for staff and ground organization. Cruzs backers are hopeful the ads will pull him ahead of Trump. Cruz is locked in a tight battle in his home state of Texas, where 155 delegates to be sent to the Republican National Convention are at stake, out of almost 600 delegates total in the states voting on Super Tuesday.  On Super Tuesday, voters can both send a message to Washington AND send a serious, proven conservative to the White House by voting for Cruz, said Kellyanne Conway, president of Keep the Promise I, one of the groups backing Cruz. The groups spent $393,500 on radio ads in seven states. They also purchased more than $990,0000 in television ads that will run in Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas and Oklahoma - the most crucial states for Cruz to narrow the margins with Trump.  The groups also spent $1 million on digital ads in eight states, including Minnesota, where so far none of the outside groups have bought advertising.

Republican Rubio chips away at Trump with Super Tuesday looming,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Emboldened by a strong debate performance, U.S. Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio went after front-runner Donald Trump again on Friday, undeterred by opinion polls predicting the billionaire would win big in the crucial Super Tuesday nominating contests next week.  With Trump, 69, increasingly looking to be the partys likely nominee for the Nov. 8 election, Rubio on Thursday night scored his most aggressive debate performance of the months-long election campaign. Trumps swipes at rival candidates and heated exchanges with others have bolstered his standing in nominating contests and opinion polls. On Thursday night, his rivals struck back. The U.S. senator from Florida, Rubio, 44, brought up the real estate developers four past bankruptcies and his use of imported Polish workers to work at a Florida resort, and pointedly suggested the New Yorker would not be where he is today in the real estate business without a family inheritance.        But attacks by Rubio and fellow candidate Ted Cruz, a conservative U.S. senator from Texas, only dented Trumps momentum, according to opinion polls and online betting markets. PredictWise, a research projectthat analyzes opinion polls and betting markets, said Trump would comfortably win among Republicans in all but one of 11 states that it measured in the March 1 nominating contests, known as Super Tuesday. Cruz, 45, is likely to win in Texas, his home state, PredictWise said.     PredictIt, based out of Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, on Friday gave Trump a 73 percent chance of winning the nomination compared with a peak 75 percent chance two days earlier. Rubio is his closest rival at 27 percent, up only a point from the day before. With Trump, a brash former reality TV show host, now winning three straight nominating contests in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada, denial is giving way to a mostly gloomy acceptance among Republicans in Washington that he may have too much momentum to be stopped, especially if he wins big in the key Southern primaries next week. Rubio, the leading candidate from the Republican establishment, took a swipe at Trump again on Friday. Guys, we have a con artist as the front-runner of the Republican Party,  he said at a campaign event in Dallas.  Rubio described various Trump business ventures that he said had failed. You ever heard of Trump vodka?You have? Well, it isnt around anymore, said Rubio, a first-term senator and foreign policy hawk.     Trump has vowed to build a wall on the U.S.- Mexican border, called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and promised to take a tough stance on trade against China.

"Bernie Sanders action toy slouches, points and raises lots of cash ","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Orders for a Bernie Sanders action figure, complete with the U.S. Democratic presidential hopefuls signature slouch, open mouth and accusatory pointed finger, were flooding in from fans on Thursday, months ahead of the toys delivery date in July. Brooklyn product design company FCTRY created a prototype for the 6-inch (15-cm) tall plastic version of the Vermont senator and started a Kickstarter campaign with a goal of raising $15,000 to fund production. Within 24 hours of the campaigns debut on Wednesday, FCTRY  had raised about $40,000 from fans snapping up various deals, including a sold-out $20 offer for a single Bernie Sanders action figure called The Early Bern Special #1. The company has also sold 20,000 Hillary Clinton action figures depicting the former secretary of state and Democratic presidential hopeful in a sky blue pant suit. It previously sold 200,000 President Barack Obama action figures, said FCTRY Chief Executive Jason Feinberg. If you buy one of our action figures, whether its Hillary or now Bernie, well donate $1 from that sale online to their actual campaign, Feinberg said. The idea is to have a way where regular people can sort of easily participate in campaign donations through a small business. A prototype of the Bernie Sanders action figure was created by Seattle pop-artist Mike Leavitt and will be mass produced overseas, Feinberg said. The figures are expected to be ready in July, the same month as the 2016 Democratic National Convention, when Clinton and Sanders face off as the party chooses its nominee for U.S. president and vice president for the November national election. The company has no plans to turn New York real estate developer Donald Trump, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida or any of the other Republican White House contenders into toys. In 2008, we were sort of compelled to make a (Senator John) McCain and its something Ive always regretted so there were no Republicans this time, Feinberg said.  Among the pre-order deals available online is The Full Ticket, which includes a single Bernie Sanders action figure plus a single Hillary Clinton action figure. Were just sayin. Crazier things have happened, the Kickstarter site notes. A Sanders spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"In Florida, Donald Trump has a model for success","SARASOTA, Fla. (Reuters) - The pundits said he never had a chance: He was a high-powered U.S. businessman who had never run for office. He largely financed his own campaign. He took a hard line on illegal immigration and Obamacare. His attacks on Islam were controversial. Six years ago that businessman, Rick Scott, won Floridas Republican primary for governor. He then went on to take the general election. Now in his second term, Scott is in many ways a prototype for Donald Trumps U.S. presidential campaign. Scotts success in Florida is something that should give serious pause to Marco Rubio, a U.S. senator from the state who hopes to use it as a springboard to unseat Trump as the leading contender for the Republican nomination to the Nov. 8 election.  Floridas March 15 primary, to select a wealth of delegates to the Republicans July nominating convention, is likely the final chance for Rubio, and perhaps the Republican establishment, to halt the furious advance of Trump, a billionaire businessman with homes in New York and Florida. Trumps two leading strategists in Florida have strong ties to Scott, rebutting the commonly held presumption among Trumps critics that his campaign is all about the former reality TV show hosts celebrity and popular appeal and not about tactics.  Nobody thought he had a shot. Nobody! said Joe Gruters, a top Republican Party official in the state who was an early ally of Scott and who now co-chairs Trumps Florida effort. The establishment threw everything you can imagine at Rick Scott. A first-term senator, Rubio has finished behind Trump in early-nomination contests to date. Rubio grew up in Miami, and his Cuban-American heritage could give him an edge with the states burgeoning Latino population.  But Rubio is still climbing uphill in the state race. While he has benefited from the withdrawal from the race of another Florida son, ex-Governor Jeb Bush, he trails Trump significantly. A Quinnipiac University survey released on Thursday showed Trump with 44 percent of the Republican vote, with Rubio far behind at 28 percent.  The good news for Rubio is that its the highest level of support he has had in the state, suggesting that he is moving upward when he needs it the most. But it may not be enough with many voters having cast early and absentee ballots. When you have such a commanding lead like Trump has in all these states, you have the ability to focus on states like Florida where you know you can deliver the knockout blow, Gruters said. While other Republicans campaigned in early-voting states, Trump served notice he was taking winning Florida seriously, methodically holding large-scale events across Florida, including one in October in Miami, home to both Rubio and Bush. When Bush and Rubio came to Florida at all, it was largely to raise money in closed-door fundraisers. Theres a big difference between when you have 10,000 people showing up to a rally, hearing the battle cry and getting motivated, Gruters said, than when you are meeting people for $10,000-a-plate dinners where you exclude the rank-and-file members. Bushs campaign was in such poor shape near the end that when a Reuters correspondent visited his state campaign office in Tampa, it was deserted. All of the staff and volunteers had been sent to South Carolina for a primary vote in an unsuccessful last-ditch effort to rescue his presidential bid.  Gruters is vice-chairman of the state Republican Party, making him perhaps the highest-ranking party official in the country to embrace Trump. He heads Trumps Florida effort with Susie Wiles of Jacksonville, who ran Scotts 2010 campaign. He said he sees strong similarities between Scott and Trump.  Its not unusual for Florida to elect these non-establishment guys, he said.  Scott was the former CEO of Columbia/HCA, the healthcare giant that ultimately settled a massive billing fraud case brought by the U.S. government during his tenure. When he entered the 2010 Republican primary, the assumption was that it was Attorney General Bill McCollums race to lose.  Financing his own campaign, Scott ran hard to McCollums right, supporting Arizonas then highly controversial anti-immigration law and releasing an ad that ripped President Barack Obama for defending a possible mosque in New York near the site of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Like Trump, Scott portrayed himself as a businessman better suited to repairing the distressed economy than the Republican establishment was. They both bring the same kind of attitude to government, said Susan MacManus, a political science professor at the University of South Florida, that a business person can run government better than professional politicians.  Trump has contributed $125,000 to Scotts political-action committee since 2012. Some have speculated Scott could serve as Trumps vice presidential nominee. But in what may serve as another lesson for Trump, Scott remains a highly polarizing figure. His relationship with the state legislature has been prickly  and his approval ratings have never crossed 50 percent. He entered politics with half the states voters liking him, MacManus said. Hes never gone much beyond that. Bushs departure from the presidential race has left Rubio flying the establishment flag. His local supporters say it already has made a huge difference, both in terms of support and money. (Bush) was dividing votes, Tom Rooney, a U.S. congressman from Florida who is chairing Rubios campaign here, told Reuters. We dont have that issue anymore. The Rubio campaign, in Florida as elsewhere, is not courting Trumps voters. It believes they are unlikely to switch. Instead, Rooney said, the idea is to woo the 60-65 percent of the party that so far has not supported Trump.  To that end, Rubio has been playing catch-up, opening new offices and securing a bevy of endorsements from local politicians. But Rooney concedes while Rubio has consoled himself with second-place finishes in places such as Iowa and South Carolina, that will not be enough in Florida, especially given that the winner gets all of the states 99 delegates.  When we get into the winner-take-all states, Rooney said, you cant come in second and say youre doing well.

Rubio keeps swinging at Trump after Republican debate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio on Friday called front-runner Donald Trump a con artist, pledging to expose the real estate mogul and pressure him to reveal his finances. In a series of television interviews, the U.S. senator from Florida said working-class voters are being fooled by Trumps lofty promises, despite his own string of lawsuits and the bankruptcies of Trump-related companies. We are not going to turn over the conservative movement to a con artist who is telling people one thing but has spent 40 years sticking it to working Americans and now claims to be their champion, he said on NBCs Today program. Rubios comments echoed the attacks he and fellow senator and candidate Ted Cruz made on Trump during Thursdays heated televised debate in Texas, one of 11 U.S. states set to vote in nominating contests on Tuesday. Trump, in a post on Twitter Friday morning, fired back by saying: Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a chocker (sic)! Mr. Meltdown. Hes says Im a choker? Rubio responded in an interview on ABCs Good Morning America. Hes a con artist. Its a fraud. Were going to expose him. With Trump leading in opinion polls in nearly all of the Super Tuesday contests, Republicans are recognizing the brash mogul and reality television star is likely to be their nominee even as Rubio and Cruz try to shake up the race ahead of the Nov. 8 election.  Rubio, who has admittedly struggled with his own personal finances such as student loans, accused Trump of withholding his tax records because they likely show hes not as rich as he claims to be. Trump, who puts his fortune at $10 billion, has said he would release his tax records in coming months but said he cannot release his them now because he is being audited.  Hes making things up, Rubio told NBC. We need to see those returns to see if the difference between the audited  version and what he filed if there is evidence of wrongdoing.  Asked if his strategy to push back against Trump now comes too late, Rubio said he was fighting for the good of his party. He said he would continue to gain support on Tuesday and predicted a win in his home state of Florida on March 15.

"Fight night: Rubio, Cruz gang up on Trump in debate ploy","HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican rivals Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz ganged up on front-runner Donald Trump at a raucous debate on Thursday in a last-ditch bid to keep the billionaire from winning victories next week that could set him up to clinch the presidential nomination. The CNN-hosted debate at the University of Houston was the two first-term senators last, best chance to try to shake up the race for the Republican nomination. The contest is dramatically shifting toward Trump, who is leading in opinion polls in nearly all 11 states set to make their choices on next Tuesday. Rubio and Cruz landed blows on Trump, took some withering fire in return and may wonder why they did not pursue such a strategy in the debates of past weeks and months when former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, now out of the race, was the lead Trump attacker. A confident-sounding Trump was unbowed and dismissed the attacks from his center-stage position. He declared Rubio a choke artist for a faltering debate in New Hampshire, again labeled Cruz a liar and urged his rivals to take their best shot. Swing for the fences, he said, wielding a baseball metaphor. Rubio, who got some momentum with a second-place finish to Trump in South Carolina last Saturday and has picked up some Bush supporters, gave his most aggressive performance to date. The senator from Florida wants to be the last Trump opponent standing and perhaps stretch the contest to the Republican nominating convention in July. He brought up Trumps four past bankruptcies and his use of imported Polish workers to work at a Florida resort, and pointedly suggested the New Yorker would not be where he is today in the real estate business without a family inheritance. Without the family money, Rubio said, You know where Donald Trump would be right now? Selling watches in Manhattan. Significantly, Rubio sought to raise doubts about the depth of Trumps policy knowledge, a point of attack that Trumps critics in the Republican establishment have been urging candidates to pursue for months. Rubio pointed out that Trumps sole plan to replace and repeal Democratic President Barack Obamas signature healthcare law is to allow insurance companies to operate across state lines. When Trump repeated the same point twice, Rubio interrupted. Now hes repeating himself, said the senator, who was skewered at a debate in New Hampshire last month for robotically repeating his talking points. Trump fired back: I watched him repeat himself five times four weeks ago, and I gotta tell you it was a meltdown. I watched him melt down on the stage like Ive never seen anybody. Cruz, who needs to win his home state of Texas when it votes on Tuesday, also piled on Trump, saying his rival would be a weak Republican opponent to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 general election because he had donated to the Clinton Foundation founded by her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Cruz said Hillary Clinton would say to him, Gosh, Donald you gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation. I even went to your wedding. ... He cant prosecute the case against Hillary. Trump ridiculed Cruz for his inability to win more than the early voting state of Iowa and taunted him for being behind Trump in opinion polls in Texas. Since a second-place finish in Iowa, Trump has won New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. If I cant beat her (Clinton), youre really going to get killed arent you? ... I know youre embarrassed, but keep fighting, Trump said. The crossfire was so intense that CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer lost control of the proceedings at times.  Among the other two candidates on the stage, Ohio Governor John Kasich turned in a positive performance with an optimistic message, hoping Rubio and Cruz will falter and he will end up as the central Trump alternative. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, flagging in the polls, provided some comic relief. He said that, as president, when considering potential Supreme Court nominees he would look at the fruit salad of their life and asked plaintively for more time to talk: Can someone attack me please? Even with his bombast, Trump turned in a more measured performance than usual, defending his moderate positions on Planned Parenthood and retaining popular parts of the Obamacare law, perhaps mindful that he is closing in on a victory in the Republican race. He said he would not support a ceasefire deal about to go into effect in Syria and declared that Libya would be better off had Colonel Muammar Gaddafi not been toppled from power by a U.S.-backed uprising in 2011. Pressed on whether he would release his tax records as 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney said he should do, Trump said he would eventually do so after a routine audit is completed. This did not satisfy Romney, who tweeted that there was no legitimate reason for withholding them even if they were under audit. Rubio went after Trump hard on illegal immigration. He said Trump may talk tough on illegal immigration now, but previously said Romney lost his race against Obama by promoting the idea that illegal immigrants should self-deport. A lot of these positions that hes taken now are new to him, Rubio said. Trump said Romney lost in 2012 because he was a terrible candidate. Excuse me, he ran one terrible campaign, Trump said. While Trump has scored early victories and is well ahead in national opinion polls, he has some ways to go to clinch his partys nomination, which is decided by the number of delegates sent to the July party convention following the state-by-state nominating contests. So far Trump leads the race with 81 delegates, with Cruz and Rubio well behind at 17 apiece. To secure the nomination, a candidate needs 1,237 delegates. Super Tuesday will be critical because there are nearly 600 delegates at stake in Republican races that day.

Republican Sandoval withdraws as possible Supreme Court pick,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval, a moderate Republican, took himself out of consideration for appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday as Senate Republicans dug in on their vow not to act on any nominee by President Barack Obama. Asked if the White House was disappointed by Sandovals decision, Obama spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters, Hes obviously entitled to make decisions about his own career. Sandovals name surfaced as a possible nominee on Wednesday, but Senate Republicans quickly said they still would not hold hearings or vote on any Obama nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Obamas appointee could pivot the court to the left for the first time in decades. Sandoval, a Mexican-American who was Nevadas first Hispanic governor, did not offer a reason for his withdrawal. Earlier today, I notified the White House that I do not wish to be considered at this time for possible nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States, he said in a statement. The notion of being considered for a seat on the highest court in the land is beyond humbling and I am incredibly grateful to have been mentioned. Earlier on Thursday, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton expressed concern about Sandoval, urging Obama to pick a true progressive. But Nancy Pelosi, the top House of Representatives Democrat, called it a good idea for Obama to consider Republicans as well as Democrats. The Republican-led Senate must confirm any nominee. Sandoval, 52, was appointed a judge by Republican President George W. Bush before becoming governor. He took a traditional Republican stance backing gun rights but held more moderate views on social issues, supporting abortion rights. Obama will meet next Tuesday with Senate Republican and Democratic leaders regarding a court nominee, officials said. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said they will use the meeting to reiterate the Republican stance that the Senate will not act on any Supreme Court nominee until the next president takes office in January 2017, following the Nov. 8 presidential election. Republicans hope to win back the White House then. The fight over the nomination got nastier as Grassley accused Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of childish tantrums after Reid called Grassley the most obstructionist Judiciary Committee chairman ever. Reid responded: A childish tantrum, when were asking him to do his job? ",politicsNews,"February 25, 2016 ",1
"U.S., backed by China, proposes tough N.Korea sanctions at U.N.","UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States presented a draft Security Council resolution on Thursday it negotiated with China that would dramatically tighten existing restrictions on North Korea after its Jan. 6 nuclear test and create the toughest U.N. sanctions regime in over two decades. The draft, seen by Reuters, would require U.N. member states to conduct mandatory inspections of all cargo passing through their territory to or from North Korea to look for illicit goods. Previously states were only required to do this if they had reasonable grounds to believe there was illicit cargo. The United States used the nearly two months of bilateral negotiations that at one point involved President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, diplomats said, to win Chinas support for unusually tough measures intended to persuade its ally North Korea to abandon its atomic weapons program. The proposal would close a gap in the U.N. arms embargo on Pyongyang by banning all weapons imports and exports.  There would also be an unprecedented ban on the transfer to North Korea of any item that could directly contribute to the operational capabilities of the North Korean armed forces, such as trucks that could be modified for military purposes. Other proposed measures include a ban on all supplies of aviation and rocket fuel to North Korea, a requirement for states to expel North Korean diplomats engaging in illicit activities, and blacklisting 17 North Korean individuals and 12 entities, including the National Aerospace Development Agency or NADA, the body responsible for Februarys rocket launch.  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power told reporters the new measures, if approved, would be the strongest set of sanctions imposed by the Security Council in more than two decades. Several council diplomats predicted a Saturday meeting to adopt the draft but Russian deputy U.N. ambassador Petr Iliichev told Reuters Moscow needed time to study the draft and the earliest likely vote would be next week. The draft was the result of seven weeks of tough negotiations between the United States and China, North Koreas neighbor and main ally. This is a very robust resolution, a U.S. official said on condition of anonymity. Clearly this took a long time ... it was a difficult process. North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 because of its multiple nuclear tests and rocket launches. China and the United States had differed on how strongly to respond to Pyongyangs most recent test, with Washington urging harsh punitive measures and Beijing emphasizing dialogue and milder U.N. steps confined to non-proliferation. The Global Times, an influential Chinese tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party, said in an editorial that North Korea deserves the punishment of new sanctions, but China should cushion Washingtons harsh sanctions to some extent.  China insists the sanctions should focus on striking North Koreas ability to continue developing nuclear weapons. It is the fundamental difference between Chinas policy and that of the U.S., South Korea and Japan. China holds unswerving goodwill toward North Korea, which Chinese society hopes Pyongyang can understand, it said. Diplomats said a sharp tightening of restrictions was necessary since Pyongyang has proved its determination to flout at all costs attempts at constraining its nuclear and missile programs.  They said they hoped the latest measures would make it harder for North Korea to continue with that policy, keeping up the pressure on the countrys leadership without making the countrys impoverished population any poorer. Pyongyang has prioritized the pursuit of these massively expensive programs over absolutely everything else, the U.S. official said. So is New York action going to automatically convince the regimes leaders to cease? I think were realistic on that point. However, he added that this resolution will be felt, it will have an impact ... The DPRK (North Korea) have never been subject to the kind of pressure that is in the resolution.  Power said the measures were aimed at the countrys leadership, and careful not to punish the North Korean people. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular press briefing on Thursday: We hope and believe this new resolution can help effectively constrain North Korea from further developing its nuclear missile program. There will also be further restrictions aimed at making it more difficult for North Korea to press ahead with its nuclear and missile programs. Pyongyang is currently banned from importing and exporting nuclear and missile technology and is not allowed to import luxury goods. The list of banned items will be expanded. The U.S. official said one of five annexes to the resolution lists 31 ships owned by North Korean shipping firm Ocean Maritime Management Company Limited, which will be blacklisted.  Also new, countries will be required, not just encouraged, to freeze the assets of North Korean entities linked to Pyongyangs nuclear or missile programs and to prohibit the opening of new branches or offices of North Korean banks or to engage in banking correspondence with North Korean banks.

U.S. needs to streamline foreign arms sales approval process - McCain,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government needs to improve and accelerate its process for approving foreign arm sales, Senator John McCain said Thursday, warning that U.S. firms were losing billions of dollars of potential orders to countries like Russia. McCain, who heads the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee, said both the White House and State Department were too slow to process requests for arms sales from U.S. allies and coalition partners, noting he frequently received complaints from visiting defense ministers. We need to streamline that process, perhaps even with legislation. Its not working, McCain told reporters. These countries deserve a decision. If its no, its no. If its yes, its yes. Any legislative changes would be led by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which oversees foreign military sales, McCain said. He said Senator Bob Corker, who heads that  committee, had also expressed frustration about arms sales delays. McCain noted that Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar had recently purchased billions of dollars worth of equipment from Russia while waiting for potential U.S. arms sales to be processed. U.S. government officials say efforts to reform the arcane U.S. export control regime are starting to pay off but acknowledge that they have more work to do to cope with the current record level of U.S. foreign military sales and to improve the often sluggish approval process. McCain said it was important for the United States to continue supporting Israel, which had traditionally expressed reservations about large arms sales to Middle Eastern countries. But changing realities in the Middle East made it important to ensure that countries in the region had the equipment they needed to engage in actual fighting, he said. He said Israel was also relaxing its concerns given that it was facing the same enemy - Iran - as countries with a Sunni Muslim majority. McCain and other lawmakers have expressed particular frustration about two Boeing Co arms sales - an F-15 fighter jet sale to Qatar and an F/A-18E/F sale to Kuwait - that have stalled as the Obama administration focuses on concluding on a long-term military funding agreement with Israel. Reuters reported earlier this month that Boeing is nearing a decision to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to preserve its F/A-18 fighter jet line and start work on 28 F/A-18 fighter jets for Kuwait while it waits for the Obama administration to approve the deal.

Clinton opposes recommendation to drop limits on futures contracts,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (Reuters) - A top adviser to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton urged a U.S. regulator on Thursday to not abandon a proposal to limit the number of futures contracts traders can hold on certain commodities. A committee advising the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has urged it to drop its plan to cap the futures contracts traders can hold on commodities such as oil and natural gas, The New York Times reported Wednesday. Gary Gensler, a Clinton adviser and former CFTC head, told Reuters the former secretary of state believes these limits are a critical tool in curbing excessive speculation and protecting the integrity of markets and should be finalized. Congress has providedfor such rules since the 1930s to ensure that no single trader has too large a share of the market and that agricultural, energy and metals markets remain fair and competitive, Gensler said in a statement provided to Reuters. Clinton believes the rule would protect consumers, farmers and manufacturers from excessive speculation, Gensler added. Clinton, who is fending off a challenge from U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, is fresh off a victory in the Nevada primary and the two will face off in South Carolina on Saturday.  A major theme in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination has been how to best rein in the excesses of Wall Street. Both Clinton and Sanders have released plans about how they would curb excessive market speculation. The committee advising the CFTC on the limits rule was created by the Dodd-Frank Act and includes members from the energy trading industry, such as from the CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange. The New York Times reported that eight of nine members concluded that there was scant evidence the limits are needed. The lone dissenter was from a public advocacy group.

Senator McCain wants hearing on possible F-16 sale to Pakistan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain on Thursday urged the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to hold a hearing on the possible sale of Lockheed Martin Corp F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan, as more lawmakers expressed concern about the deal. McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters he was concerned about the timing of the Obama administrations decision to approve the sale of the fighter jets to Pakistan, and the potential consequences for U.S. relations with India. I would rather have seen it kicked over into the next administration, McCain said. A hearing would help senators decide what to do about the proposed sale, he said, noting he was very conflicted. The U.S. government announced on Feb. 12 that it had approved the sale to Pakistan of up to eight additional F-16 fighter jets, as well as radars and other equipment in a deal valued at $699 million.  The deal drew immediate criticism from India. Separately, U.S. Senator Rand Paul said Thursday he had introduced a resolution of disapproval seeking to halt U.S. arms sales to Pakistans government. If passed, the measure would stop the F-16 sale. U.S. lawmakers have until March 12 to block the sale. Such action is rare since deals are usually well vetted before any formal notification, and it remained unclear if lawmakers would thwart the deal. State Department spokesman David McKeeby said the proposed sale of F-16s would assist Pakistans counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations and was in the interests of Pakistan, the United States, NATO and the region. Pakistans current F-16s have proven critical to the success of these operations to date. These operations reduce the ability of militants to use Pakistani territory as a safe haven for terrorism and a base of support for the insurgency in Afghanistan, he said. McKeeby said the department was aware of congressional concerns and would continue to consult and engage with lawmakers. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker allowed the Obama administration to proceed with the deal, but said he would not approve using U.S. funds to pay for the planes through the foreign military financing (FMF) program.  Corker told Secretary of State John Kerry in a letter earlier this month that he was concerned about Pakistans ties to the Haqqani network, a militant group that U.S. officials have said is behind attacks in Afghanistan.

"In Flint, Sanders says water crisis should serve as wake-up call","FLINT, Mich. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders told residents of Flint, Michigan, on Thursday their horrific water contamination crisis should be a wake-up call about the countrys crumbling infrastructure and required an emergency response. If there is any silver lining out of this tragedy, it is my hope that the American people will look at Flint and say, never again, Sanders said on his first campaign visit to the city, where a cost-saving decision to switch the water supply has led to a public health crisis from lead contamination. We are looking at children being poisoned - if that is not an emergency, I just dont know what an emergency is, Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, told about 300 people jammed into a Flint church for a meeting that at times featured a freewheeling exchange with shouting residents. Sanders, who has made his call for a $1 trillion investment in U.S. infrastructure a key part of his campaign agenda, said Flints water crisis illustrated the need for a long-term commitment to rebuilding dilapidated water systems across the country. While Flint may be the canary in the coal mine, there are a lot of other canaries all around the country. The truth is our infrastructure is collapsing, Sanders said. I hope that out of the tragedy will come fundamental changes. Sanders Democratic campaign rival, Hillary Clinton, visited the predominantly black city weeks ago and frequently highlights the crisis as an example of racial inequity as the two candidates vie for African-American support. Sanders has called for the resignation of Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican, and met recently with some Flint activists during a visit to Michigan. He told the Flint crowd that hearing their stories of suffering was horrific. Clearly this is part of a long-term trend of starving communities of color, he said. The crisis was triggered when a city manager installed by Snyder switched the citys water supply from Lake Michigan to the nearby Flint River. The change corroded Flints aging pipes and released lead and other toxins into the water supply. President Barack Obama declared a state of emergency in Flint in January, authorizing federal emergency management officials to coordinate relief efforts. Lawmakers in Congress have wrestled with the size of a federal funding package to replace aging pipes. Sanders and Clinton will return to Flint on March 6 for their next nationally televised debate ahead of the Michigan primary on March 8.

Biden rues 'damaging' tone against Mexico in U.S. presidential race,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday said he felt almost obliged to say sorry for verbal attacks on Mexico in the U.S. presidential campaign, in which Republican front-runner Donald Trump has labeled Mexican migrants rapists and drug runners. Speaking alongside Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto during a visit to Mexico City, Biden never mentioned Trump, who nonetheless loomed large over the proceedings. Theres been a lot of damaging and incredibly inaccurate rhetoric, and I would argue, I feel almost obliged to apologize for some of what my political colleagues have said ... about Mexico, about the Mexican people, said Biden, a Democrat. Property mogul Trump, who has built up a big early lead in the race to become Republican nominee, has vowed to make Mexico pay for a wall to seal off the United States from its southern neighbor, prompting widespread criticism in both countries. I just want you to know, Mr. President, that the most heated rhetoric youve heard from some of the competitors for the nomination for president, is not who we are as the American people .... Its the exact opposite, Biden added. Without naming Trump, Pena Nieto also weighed in, saying building walls is just isolating oneself. The 2016 U.S. presidential election is on Nov. 8.     At an event earlier on Thursday, Biden had expressed concern about what the election race said about views held in the United States, calling some of the Republican campaign language dangerous, damaging and incredibly ill-advised.  The message that is coming out of the United States as a consequence of the presidential campaign, about American attitudes toward Mexicans and Mexico generally, (and) the entire hemisphere and our place in the world, is disturbing, he said. Trump, 69, has vowed to deport the 11 million migrants living illegally in the United States, a position shared by his younger Republican rival, the Texas Senator Ted Cruz.

Puerto Rico needs restructuring to avoid cascading defaults: Treasury,"NEW YORK/SAN JUAN (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury counselor Antonio Weiss said on Thursday that without a proper restructuring regime, Puerto Rico will default and litigation will intensify, as he pushed Congress to act with legislation to help the island fix its crisis. Weiss, speaking to the House Natural Resources Committee in a hearing about the islands fiscal crisis, outlined the scale of the problems the U.S. territory faces. As the cascading defaults and litigation unfold, there is real risk of another lost decade, this one more damaging than the last, Weiss said. A legislative solution for Puerto Rico, battling with $70 billion debt, may be edging closer. Legislation to find a fix for the island is expected to be drawn up following two Congressional hearings on Thursday - one in front of the House Natural Resources Committee at which Weiss was the sole witness. House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he wants the Republican-led House to develop a response to Puerto Ricos fiscal crisis during the first quarter of 2016, and Republicans plan to bring a bill addressing the crisis to the House floor by the end of March. Puerto Rico wants access to a bankruptcy-like mechanism to reduce debt - a view backed by President Barack Obamas administration and some Congressional Democrats. But majority Republicans have not supported efforts to extend bankruptcy protection to the island, a strategy which could be detrimental to some creditors, and are keen to put Puerto Rico under strict fiscal oversight.  Weiss, in questioning, said that Treasurys restructuring proposal was not envisioning the Chapter 9 bankruptcy law U.S. states can access for their public agencies, but legislation customized to the unique conditions that face Puerto Rico.  Weiss said his team will have to work to convince island leaders of the need for an oversight board for the island. I think the legislature doesnt fully understand what this oversight authority would consist of, he said.  Puerto Rico, with a 45 percent poverty rate, has been in recession for nearly a decade and is losing population to the mainland. It is suffering from a huge debt buildup and has already defaulted on some borrowings.  There is fear of the future, said Weiss. Puerto Ricans are leaving and are joining us on the mainland where they find access to jobs, a future for their children, better healthcare.  Weiss said that a failure to protect pension payments would irreparably harm retirees and add greater stress to Puerto Ricos economy.  We are deeply concerned about the pensions in Puerto Rico, he said.  The Treasury late last year envisioned giving Puerto Ricos pensioners stronger legal protection than holders of its constitutionally backed bonds if it went bankrupt, according to a draft of a proposed plan seen by Reuters. A separate hearing before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Financial Services focused on the impact to investors in the $3.7 trillion municipal bond market. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moodys Analytics, said without a broad restructuring framework to include more of the debt than a Chapter 9 framework would envision, the issue would not be solved and we will be back here again.  Legislation for Puerto Rico could potentially be written as a stand-alone law, which carries the risk of having little momentum to approve it, or attached to a bill related to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), a congressional source previously said.  An FAA authorization bill which authorizes funding for the agency could come up for a vote in the House of Representatives as early as next month.        However, a legislative solution may be hard to achieve given the differing views and acrimonious relationship between Republicans, which control Congress, and Democrats.  Tom McClintock, a Republican of California, said instead of increasing regulation, Puerto Rico needs less red tape, less tax burden and could be turned into a Hong Kong of the Caribbean.     However, Representative Raul Labrador of Idaho said he appreciated that Weiss was trying to find a solution. We dont agree on every one of your solutions but I can tell that the administration is acting in good faith in finding a solution to the problem, Labrador said.

"19 retired U.S. generals, admirals back Clinton's stance on Guantanamo","(Reuters) - A group of 19 retired U.S. generals and admirals on Thursday backed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintons position on the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo and torture and called for an end to the dangerous rhetoric from her Republican opponents. The Republican candidates have turned this into a game to see who can seem toughest. Yet, how we combat our enemies and defeat ISIS is not a game, and these proposals would only make us weaker, the retired officers said in a statement, using an acronym for Islamic State, the militant group active in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere. Republican candidates have opposed an Obama administration plan to close the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba. Republican front-runner and real estate mogul Donald Trump said this month he would bring back waterboarding, widely condemned as a form of torture, and would be open to even tougher measures in the fight against Islamic State. Clinton was secretary of state during President Barack Obamas first term, when he banned the use of torture. She has supported the closing of the Guantanamo prison for terrorism suspects, which Obama says has become a recruiting tool for militant groups fighting the United States and its allies around the globe. The retired officers said expanding the use of Guantanamo is dangerous and has real negative consequences for our national security. Expanding the use of torture, they said, would compromise global U.S. leadership and put American troops and civilians at risk. We applaud Hillary Clintons leadership on these issues and call on the immediate end to the dangerous rhetoric coming from the right, the retired officers said.

Factbox: Highlights of draft U.N. North Korea sanctions resolution,"(Reuters) - The United States on Thursday proposed a draft United Nations Security Council resolution that would dramatically tighten sanctions on North Korea following Pyongyangs recent nuclear test and missile launch. Here is an overview of the draft resolution circulated to the 15-member council:    The draft resolution targets North Koreas conventional arms capabilities by closing a gap in the arms embargo that had allowed small arms and light weapons to be sent to North Korea. North Korea would instead be subjected to a full arms embargo on all weapons. It has an unprecedented ban on the transfer to North Korea of any item that could directly contribute to the operational capabilities of the North Korean armed forces, such as trucks that could be modified for military purposes. It bans states from hosting North Korean military and policy trainers and advisors.  The draft resolution has a new requirement that states expel North Korean diplomats who are involved in illicit activities. The draft resolution has a new requirement that states must inspect on their territory all cargo going to or coming from North Korea via land, sea or air. Previously states were only required to do this if they had reasonable grounds to believe there was illicit cargo. It calls upon states to carry out inspections in a way that minimizes impact on the transfer of humanitarian relief cargo. It would ban all flights suspected of carrying prohibited items and ban all port calls by any vessel suspected of engaging in illicit activities. All vessels belonging to Ocean Maritime Management Company Limited would be banned from entering any port.  It would require states to ban the chartering of their vessels or aircraft by North Korea, unless the state determines those services are for livelihood purposes and will not be used by North Korea to generate revenue. It also requires states to ban their nationals from operating North Korean vessels or using North Korean flags of convenience.  The draft resolution would ban the supply or transfer to North Korea of aviation fuel, including rocket fuel.  It would ban the export of gold, titanium ore, vanadium ore and rare earth minerals. It would also ban the export of coal, iron and iron ore unless such transactions are for livelihood purposes and would not be generating revenue for North Koreas nuclear and missile programs.  The draft resolution would require states to freeze the assets of any entity of the North Korean government or the ruling Workers Party of Korea that is associated with the nuclear and missile programs or other prohibited activities.  It would require states to ban North Korean banks from opening branches on their territory or engaging in correspondent relationships. It would require states to ban their financial institutions from opening new offices, subsidiaries, branches or banking accounts in North Korea.  It would require states to close existing financial activities in North Korea if there are reasonable grounds to believe those services could contribute to North Koreas nuclear or missile programs.  It would ban all public and private financial trade support to North Korea if there are reasonable grounds to believe there is a link to proliferation. The draft resolution would require states to prevent the transfer of any item that could contribute to North Koreas nuclear or ballistic missile programs. It would also update a list of banned chemical and biological weapons materials.  1) A list of 17 North Korean individuals to be blacklisted. A U.S. official said this includes people based outside of North Korea and involved in the countrys illicit programs, such as representatives of Korea Mining Developing Trading Corp, Pyongyangs primary arms dealer. Also listed are leaders of key North Korean companies responsible for illicit programs. 2) A list of 12 North Korean entities, many of which are  key North Korean government agencies responsible for illicit programs, including the National Aerospace Development Administration, the Ministry of Atomic Energy Industry, a set of banks, including Korea Kwangson Banking Corp. 3) A list of 31 vessels - with names and International Maritime Organization numbers - belonging to Ocean Maritime Management Company Limited.  4) A list of additional technical items that could be used to advance North Koreas nuclear, missile, chemical or  biological activities. 5) An illustrative lists of banned luxury items: watches, aquatic recreational vehicles, snowmobiles valued more than $2,000, lead crystal and recreational sports equipment.

Committee chair McCain vows to block contract for new Northrop bomber,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain on Thursday vowed to block use of a cost-plus type of contract, under which the government would be responsible for cost overruns, for a new long-range bomber to be built by Northrop Grumman Corp. McCain told reporters he would seek to block authorization of the new U.S. Air Force long-range strike bomber in its current form, arguing that cost-plus deals inevitably lead to cost overruns. We can disapprove it ... I will not authorize a program that has a cost-plus contract, McCain said, when asked about the contract, which the U.S. Air Force has already signed with Northrop. McCain said the military often argued that cost-plus contracts were necessary in cases involving cutting-edge technologies since unknown problems could emerge, but such practices were unheard of in Silicon Valley. The Air Force said that only the engineering and development phase of the program, valued at $21.4 billion, was structured as a cost-plus contract with incentive fees. The second part of the contract, which would cover initial production of the first five sets of new bombers, usually the most expensive planes in a new class of aircraft, would be structured with a firm, fixed-price. The Air Force has not disclosed the full projected cost of the program, although it has said that it expects to pay $511 million per plane in 2010 dollars. The Air Force values the oversight role that Senator McCain has and looks forward to continuing to work with him and the committee on moving forward with this critical capability for the department and the nation. The Department looks forward to being able to provide the Senator a complete briefing of the program at his earliest convenience, the aerial warfare service said. Officials were expected to brief McCain in the next couple of weeks, a spokeswoman said. Northrop declined comment. The Senate Armed Services Committee and its counterpart in the House of Representatives approve legislation that sets defense policy, while funding for the military is governed by the House and Senate appropriations committees. McCain also took issue with the high level of secrecy shrouding the bomber program, and the Air Forces refusal thus far to divulge the names of key suppliers on the program. If someone wants to build an engine for an airplane that requires congressional authorization, then it must be known whos making it and under what circumstances, he said.

Detroit mayor unveils budget with eye on shedding state oversight,"(Reuters) - Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan proposed a $2.6 billion fiscal 2017 budget on Thursday that he said could be the citys ticket to removing state oversight of its finances. He said the all-funds budget, which includes $1.077 billion of general fund spending, would mark the third-straight balanced budget for the city, which exited the biggest-ever municipal bankruptcy in December 2014. A financial review commission was created under Michigan law to oversee a post-bankruptcy Detroit until it reaches certain benchmarks. If we can finish the 2017 fiscal year with a balanced budget and were paying our bills and meeting some other conditions that I believe well meet, we will be able to get out of the financial review commission control period, Duggan told the city council. He added the goal is to shed state oversight by January 2018. If the city ends fiscal 2017 with a deficit, the mayor said Detroit would have to start a new three-year balanced budget cycle. Detroit Chief Financial Officer John Hill said the budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 is based on conservative revenue estimates that could be hurt if the state cuts revenue sharing to local governments to deal with costs for the ongoing lead-tainted water crisis in Flint.  The mayor said he plans to tap $50 million in unused, voter-approved bond proceeds dating as far back as 1987 for various projects. Duggan also addressed a $490 million increase in the unfunded liability for Detroits two pension funds caused by the use of outdated mortality tables by the citys bankruptcy consultants. The situation has become pretty adversarial with the consultants, who have been told by the city not to destroy any of the documents they took with them, according to the mayor. He cautioned the council that a malpractice lawsuit against the consultants would be difficult to win.  ",politicsNews,"February 25, 2016 ",1
Democratic senators raise concerns about Charter-Time Warner Cable tie-up,"(Reuters) - Five Democratic U.S. senators, including presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, told the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission on Thursday that they had significant concerns about Charter Communications Incs (CHTR.O) planned acquisition of Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N and Bright House Networks. The senators, who also included Elizabeth Warren, Ed Markey, Ron Wyden and Al Franken, said in a letter to the agencies that are reviewing the proposal that the deal would create a nationwide broadband duopoly, with Charter and Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) in nearly two-thirds of U.S. high-speed broadband homes. The senators urged the government to thoroughly address all potential harm to consumers. They also raised concerns that Charter will take on significant debt that could harm its ability to honor commitments to build out its network, including in rural areas. The FCC has said U.S. broadband prices are among the worlds most expensive, according to the senators, who urged more competition.  The merger could lead to higher prices and fewer innovative services, they added. Charter said in May that it would buy Time Warner Cable in a $56 billion cash-and-stock deal that would make it the No. 2 U.S. Internet and cable company after Comcast. Shareholders of both companies and most U.S. states have approved the deal, which still awaits clearance from the federal government. On Wednesday, Charter said it had won approval from New Jersey and was only awaiting clearance from two states where it  will operate as New Charter. The company agreed to return Time Warner Cable call centers to the United States and add jobs.  Having demonstrated that the pending transactions with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks are squarely in the public interest, Charter remains confident they will close in a timely fashion, the company said on Wednesday. New Charter would be the third-largest cable provider in the country, serving roughly 17.3 million customers, and the second-largest broadband provider, with 19.4 million subscribers. It would be in nearly 40 states. Charter and Time Warner Cable did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday. FCC spokeswoman Kim Hart said the commission had received the letter and was reviewing it. The FCC hopes to complete its review by the end of March. In April, Comcast withdrew its $45 billion offer for Time Warner Cable after U.S. regulators raised concerns that the deal would give it an unfair advantage in the cable TV and Internet-based services market.

Kerry urges Congress not to rush to renew Iran sanctions measure,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Secretary of State John Kerry urged Congress on Thursday not to rush to renew the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA), a broad U.S. law imposing sanctions over Irans nuclear and missile programs that expires at the end of the year. I wouldnt advise that for a number of reasons, Kerry told the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee at a hearing on the State Departments budget. Many lawmakers have been pushing to renew the ISA quickly, to send a message to Tehran that Congress is still taking a hard line over its nuclear program, missile development and human rights record. The effort could set up another showdown over Iran between the administration and the Republicans who control Congress. Every Republican in Congress, and several of President Barack Obamas fellow Democrats, opposed the agreement announced in July in which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. House Republicans early this month passed legislation to restrict Obamas ability to lift sanctions under the nuclear pact. The Senate has not taken it up and Obama has threatened a veto, and lawmakers are discussing alternatives. If the administration isnt supportive of this renewal (of the ISA), not only are we preventing the possibility of a snapback, but from the standpoint of myself and many of the members of this committee, were also giving relief on missiles, said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican committee chairman. Iran tested ballistic missile technology in October, prompting the United States to impose new sanctions in January, but many members of Congress want a stronger response. Kerry said lawmakers should allow more time to see how Iran responds to the international nuclear agreement, which went into effect only last month. He argued that sanctions can be imposed quickly if Iran is found to violate terms of the nuclear deal or other agreements. Kerry was asked about reports that Iran will enjoy a windfall of up to $150 billion from the nuclear agreement as money frozen under the sanctions regime is released. He said the total likely would be about one-third of that level, and currently is far lower. Our estimates are its somewhere in the vicinity of $50 to $55 billion at some point in time but its way below that right now. Kerry said. And in fact, they are complaining about the slowness with which there has been a process of repatriation. ",politicsNews,"February 25, 2016 ",1

Michigan Governor Snyder to testify at House hearing on Flint,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Michigan Governor Rick Snyder will testify at a House oversight committee hearing on March 17 on the Flint, Michigan, drinking water crisis, the panel said on Thursday. Snyder, a Republican, has publicly apologized for the crisis in which thousands of children are believed to have ingested dangerous amounts of lead from the citys water.  Snyder has also said missteps by the federal Environmental Protection Agency helped lead to the crisis in Flint, a predominantly African-American city of 100,000 about 60 miles (100 km) northwest of Detroit.    Under direction of a state-appointed city manager in 2014, Flint changed its water supply from Detroits to the Flint River, and the more caustic water helped to leach lead, a neurotoxin, from old pipes into the drinking water. The former city manager, Darnell Earley, and the former Midwest EPA chief, Susan Hedman, will also testify before the committee at separate hearing on March 15.

But Hatch said even if Obama were to put forward a Republican for the empty seat, the Senate should not consider it during the throes of a very intense, and some people think horrific, presidential campaign.

Obama weighs Republican for Supreme Court,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama is considering appointing a moderate Republican to the Supreme Court, a source close to the process said on Wednesday, but leaders in the Republican-led Senate held firm to their threat to block anyone he nominates. The source said Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval, a Republican and former federal judge, was among the possible candidates.  As governor, Sandoval has taken a traditional Republican stance in support of gun rights, but his more moderate views on social issues, such as abortion rights, could make him an attractive choice for the Democratic president. A 52-year-old Mexican-American, Sandoval was appointed a judge by Republican George W. Bush, Obamas predecessor, before being elected governor in 2010. He abandoned his states legal defense of a same-sex marriage ban before the Supreme Court declared such bans unconstitutional last year. The Feb. 13 death of long-serving conservative Justice Antonin Scalia created a vacancy on the nine-seat court and ignited a political fight. Republicans are maneuvering to foil Obamas ability to choose a replacement who could tilt the court to the left for the first time in decades. Scalias death left the court with four liberals and four conservatives. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced on Tuesday the Senate will not hold hearings or vote on any Supreme Court nominee until the next president takes office in January 2017, following the Nov. 8 presidential election. Republicans hope to win back the White House then. The Senate must confirm any high court nominee, but McConnell remained unswayed even with word that Obama was considering the Republican Sandoval for the job. This nomination will be determined by whoever wins the presidency in the fall, McConnell said. Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee that would hold any confirmation hearings, concurred, saying, Its the principle, not the person. The White House said it was hoping for a meeting with Grassley and his committees top Democrat, Patrick Leahy. A McConnell aide said McConnell was trying to schedule a meeting with Obama to reiterate his opposition to any nominee. Sandoval met on Monday in the U.S. Capitol for about 30 minutes with Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada, and Reid asked him whether he would be interested in being considered for the high court job, according to the source, who asked not to be identified. He said he was interested, the source said of Sandoval, adding that a number of people are being checked out for the job. Reid is a close ally of Obama. White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined during a briefing to confirm whether Sandoval was on Obamas list of potential nominees. White House officials are seeking a candidate they think lawmakers from both parties could support, but Obama may be unlikely to choose any Republican, even a centrist. The Democratic political base would object to such a choice, a risk Obama is unlikely to take during an election year.     Some liberal groups expressed alarm that Sandoval would be considered. Charles Chamberlain of the group Democracy for America called it downright absurd that Obama would risk his legacy by appointing another anti-labor Republican to an already pro-big business Supreme Court. Sandoval opposed Obamas healthcare law, but opted to expand his states Medicaid health insurance program for the poor under the measure, breaking from a number of Republican governors who refused to do so.   He expressed support for bipartisan immigration legislation that passed the Senate in 2013 before dying in the House of Representatives amid Republican opposition. In 2013, Sandoval vetoed legislation to require background checks on all Nevada gun sales. Last year, he signed a law backed by the National Rifle Association that expanded the defenses for justifiable homicide and repealed a local ordinance that required handgun registration. Obama vowed on Wednesday to move ahead with a nominee and said Republicans would risk public ire if they blocked a qualified candidate for political motives, as well as diminishing the credibility of the high court. Obama said he expected the Senate Judiciary Committee to extend his nominee the courtesy of a confirmation hearing and then vote on whether he or she is qualified. In the meantime, the American people are going to have the ability to gauge whether the person Ive nominated is well within the mainstream, is a good jurist, is somebody whos worthy to sit on the Supreme Court, Obama told reporters in the Oval Office. I think it will be very difficult for Mr. McConnell to explain how, if the public concludes that this persons very well qualified, that the Senate should stand in the way simply for political reasons. Liberals vowed to pressure Senate Republicans into considering Obamas nominee, with several groups delivering to the Senate boxes of what they said contained 1.3 million signatures from citizens demanding that a confirmation process go forward after the president announces his pick.

Exclusive: Latino coalition releases policy agenda for 2016 U.S. election,"(Reuters) - A coalition of some of the largest U.S. Latino organizations on Thursday will lay out a raft of policies that, they say, presidential candidates and other politicians must heed to earn the votes of the growing group of voters.  The National Hispanic Leadership Agenda (NHLA), which includes 40 national and regional groups, will recommend policies on everything from economic security, education and comprehensive immigration reform to the environment and health. For Latino communities and the politicians seeking their votes - including candidates in the November 2016 presidential election - the agenda is a road map, said Hector Sanchez, the chairman of the NHLA. For the next four years, this is our guide for collaborating with Congress and collaborating with the White House, he added. The agenda underscores the growing power of Latinos as a part of the electorate, as presidential candidates have sought to win over those voters on the way to the White House. Latinos are among the nations fastest growing ethnic groups, and, because of lower voter turnout levels in the past, represent a potential pool of previously untapped voters. The campaigns of both Democratic contenders for the presidency, for example, have recently argued over who actually won the Hispanic vote at last weeks Nevada caucus.  While former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won the state overall, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders said that entrance polls show he won Hispanics. The Clinton campaign disputes those numbers.  The NHLAs agenda recommends expanding job opportunities, improving retirement security and increasing support for homeownership.  Under immigration, the group wants to see comprehensive immigration reform - a hot button issue in this years election. The group wants a path to citizenship, protections for immigrant workers and family reunification provisions, among other items. The NHLA also supports addressing the root causes of forced migration and opposes efforts that call into question the citizenship of persons born in the United States, the group wrote in the 2016 Hispanic Public Policy Agenda. Billionaire businessman Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner for his partys nomination, has repeatedly taken a hard line against illegal immigration, calling for the construction of a wall on the border with Mexico. Trump angered a number of activists, Latinos and others when, in launching his campaign last year, he suggested that Mexican immigrants were rapists and criminals. But the criticisms have done little to stop him, with Trump now having won three of the four earliest nominating contests among Republican contenders.

"Trump's surge confounds rivals, makes him betting favorite","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps chances of clinching the U.S. Republican presidential nomination shot to a record high on global betting websites on Wednesday and the billionaire businessman, long viewed as a political outsider, won his first endorsement from a member of Congress. Trump easily won the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday, giving him his third win in four early nominating contests and pressuring Republican rivals to come up with a way to stop a candidate who only last year was not seen as a serious contender for the Nov. 8 presidential election.  The real estate magnate swept Nevada by a margin of 22 percentage points, winning 45.9 percent of the vote.  It was the high point so far of an unorthodox campaign  during which Trump has fought with Pope Francis, called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and promised to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border to prevent illegal immigration.     Trumps Nevada win is likely to further frustrate Republican establishment figures who, less than a month ago, were hoping his campaign as a political outsider was stalled after he lost the opening nominating contest in Iowa to Ted Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas.  In his victory speech in Nevada, the former reality TV show host courted his base of blue-collar workers.  I love the poorly educated, he said, mentioning several demographic groups among whom he said he was winning. By Wednesday, that phrase was being widely discussed online, with some finding it funny and others arguing it was a welcome, nonjudgmental embrace of a constituency that other politicians might speak of only as a problem to be fixed. Trumps nearest rivals, Cruz and Marco Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida, have frequently attacked each other, clearing a path for Trump to the Republican nomination that includes primary elections in a slew of southern states on March 1, known as Super Tuesday.  These guys have to figure out how to turn their fire on Trump, said Ford OConnell, a Republican strategist in Washington. Absent that, he said: Which one is going to get out of this field?     Rubio said Trump was only backed by a minority of Republicans.  The vast and overwhelming majority of Republicans do not want Trump to be the nominee, he told NBC, citing the networks recent opinion poll putting him 15 points ahead of Trump in a one-on-one match-up. As long as there are four people running dividing up the non-Trump vote sooner, youre going to get results like what you saw last night. Rubio and Cruz have struggled to match the popularity of Trump, who is more ready than the two senators to deviate from the tenets of the Republican Partys brand of conservatism, including free trade and supply-side economics.      Betting venues in Britain, Ireland and New Zealand show the online wagering community coalescing around Trump, once considered an interloper, attracting long-shot odds of 200/1. Odds for Trump becoming the Republican candidate for November have tightened all the way to 1/2 in some cases.     Mr Trump has triumphed yet again, despite political analysts almost unanimously writing him off as a serious presidential contender, said Graham Sharpe from William Hill (WMH.L), adding one customer stood to collect at least $100,000 if Trump was elected to the White House.  On Wednesday, Chris Collins, a Republican congressman from Trumps home state of New York, became the first national lawmaker to endorse Trump, saying in a statement its time to say no to professional politicians and yes to someone who has created jobs and grown a business.  While more than 1,200 delegates are needed to secure the Republican presidential nomination, Trump has built a formidable head start over Rubio, who came in second in Nevada with 23.9 percent, and Cruz with 21.4 percent.  Opinion polls show Trump ahead in most Super Tuesday states. The primary election next Tuesday in Cruzs home state of Texas is looming as a make-or-break moment for him after Trumps growing success among the senators core base of evangelicals and other conservative supporters.   Texans have a good ability to see through baloney, to see through a smokescreen, to see through rhetoric and to look to substance, Cruz said at an event in Houston, the states largest city. I believe that is exactly what Texans are going to do next Tuesday.

Factbox: The race to the U.S. presidential nominations: How delegates are selected ,"(Reuters) - The nominating contests that will determine the Democratic and Republican nominees for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election are about to enter a critical phase. On March 1, known as Super Tuesday, primaries or caucuses will be held in about a dozen states, and they could be turning points in both parties. But the key to winning the nomination for each party is ultimately not about the popular vote. It is about securing the number of delegates needed to win the nomination at each partys convention - July 18-21 in Cleveland for the Republicans and July 25-28 in Philadelphia for the Democrats. Like so many things in politics, there are twists and turns in how the popular vote is used to ultimately select each partys candidate. The following is a guide to the nominating process: Q: Is the delegate selection process the same for the Republican and Democratic parties? A: No. The parties set their own rules. One thing that is the same is that at each party convention, a candidate only needs to reach a simple majority of the delegate votes to win the nomination. Q: How many delegates are there? A: The Democratic convention will be attended by about 4,763 delegates, with 2,382 delegates needed to win the nomination. The Republican convention will be attended by 2,472 delegates, with 1,237 delegates needed to win. Q: I keep hearing about superdelegates. Are they different from other delegates? Do both the Republicans and Democrats have superdelegates? A: Superdelegates, officially known as unpledged delegates, are a sort of wild card in the nominating process, but only the Democrats have them. The category was created for the 1984 Democratic convention, and according to political scientists, they are a legacy of the 1980 convention when there was a fight for the nomination between President Jimmy Carter, who was seeking a second term in the White House, and Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts. Members of Congress were frustrated by their lack of influence, because delegates elected to support one candidate could not switch to support another. So Democratic members of the House of Representatives led an effort to win a role for themselves. That resulted in the creation of superdelegates. Unlike other delegates, superdelegates may change what candidate they are supporting right up to the convention. There is no fixed number of superdelegates because the group is defined by various categories whose members change from one election cycle to another. Here is who gets to be a superdelegate:  All Democratic members of the House of Representatives and the Senate; the Democratic governors; the Democratic president and vice president of the United States; former Democratic presidents and vice presidents; former Democratic leaders of the U.S. Senate; former Democratic speakers of the House and former Democratic minority leaders. Throw in the members of the Democratic National Committee and the former chairs of the DNC and you finally have the whole pool of superdelegates. Q: What about the other delegates? Do they get to choose which candidate to support? A: Both the Democratic and Republican parties send delegates to their conventions based on the popular vote in the primary elections and caucuses held in each of the 50 states. But the parties have different rules on how delegates are allotted to a candidate. The Democratic Party applies uniform rules to all states. In each state, delegates are allocated in proportion to the percentage of the primary or caucus vote in each district. But a candidate must win at least 15 percent of the vote to be allocated any delegates. The Republican Party lets states determine their own rules, although it does dictate some things. Some states award delegates proportionate to the popular vote, although most such states have a minimum percentage that a candidate must reach to win any delegates. Some other states use the winner-take-all method, in which the candidate with the highest percentage of the popular vote is awarded all the delegates. Other states use a combination of the two methods. States that use the proportionate method may instead use the winner-take-all method if one candidate wins more than 50 percent of the popular vote.  In addition, the Republican Party requires that all states with nominating contests held between March 1 and March 14 use the proportional method, meaning that all the states holding votes on Super Tuesday will have to award delegates proportionally.  Q: What happens to delegates if a candidate drops out of the race? A: Another good question, because we have certainly seen that happen this year. For the Democratic Party, in every state, delegates are reallocated to the remaining candidates. For the Republican Party, it varies by state. In some states, delegates are required to stick with their original candidate at least through the first ballot at the Republican National Convention. In some other states, if a candidate drops out, his or her delegates may immediately pledge to another candidate. There is also a middle ground in which those delegates are reallocated to the remaining candidates.

U.S. lawmaker to introduce bill to broaden CFIUS mandate beyond security concerns,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democratic lawmaker will introduce a bill on Thursday that seeks to broaden the powers of a U.S. government panel that reviews mergers for national security concerns, including giving it the ability to block a deal if it could cause job losses, but it faces an uphill battle in the Republican-controlled House. According to a draft copy of the proposed legislation reviewed by Reuters, the multi-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) would be able to review a deal to determine whether such transaction is of net benefit to the United States. If the legislation passed, CFIUS would consider a proposed deals effect on employment, product innovation, and public health and safety, as well as national security, according to the draft reviewed by Reuters. It would also consider factors like whether a foreign company purchasing a U.S. company abides by U.S. rules concerning disclosure and transparency. But it is unclear whether the measure, which will be introduced by Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, has support from other lawmakers in the House. A spokesman for Republicans in the House Committee on Financial Services, which considered an earlier version of the bill in 2014, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Even if the DeLauro bill passed the House, there would need to be companion legislation passed in the Senate and then it would still need to get signed into law by President Barack Obama.     There is currently no companion bill in the Senate, according to a source on Capitol Hill. DeLauro introduced her previous bill following the U.S. approval of China-based Shuanghui International Holdings Ltds $4.7 billion acquisition of pork producer Smithfield Foods Inc, but it never went to the full House for a vote. While the House bill does not target China specifically, it could have most implications for the country. In 2014, the last year for which data is available, CFIUS looked at more deals involving China than any other country for the third year in a row. It comes amid signs of increased concerns in Washington about a flurry of proposed takeovers of American companies by Chinese entities.     Still, such sweeping legislation could be a tall order for the administration at a time of already tense Sino-U.S. relations. Earlier this month, 46 U.S. lawmakers, most of them Republicans, urged CFIUS to take a hard look at a bid by a Chinese company, Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group, to buy the storied Chicago Stock Exchange because of fears that the deal would give China access to the data of U.S. companies who use the exchange.        In the past few weeks alone, CFIUS concerns have killed three proposed Chinese investments. On Tuesday, Western Digital Corp (WDC.O) said Chinas Unisplendour Corp Ltd (000938.SZ) backed out of buying a stake in the U.S. company because CFIUS planned to probe it.

"U.S. looks to Facebook, private groups to battle online extremism","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government, acknowledging its limited success in combating Islamic extremist messaging, is recruiting tech companies, community organizations and educational groups to take the lead in disrupting online radicalization. The change in strategy, which took a step forward on Wednesday when the Justice Department convened a meeting with social media firms including Facebook Inc, Twitter and Alphabet Incs Google , comes despite what critics say is scant evidence on the effectiveness of such efforts. The meeting was a recognition that the government is ill-positioned and ill-equipped to counter ISIS online, Seamus Hughes, deputy director of George Washington Universitys Program on Extremism, said after attending the event, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. The federal government is not best placed to counter extremist online recruitment efforts with messaging of its own, said George Selim, director of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) office that coordinates the governments countering violent extremism (CVE) activities.  The goal now, he said, is to help communities and young people to amplify their own messages. Those messages stem from so-called counter-narrative programs underway at schools and community groups that have varying degrees of government support, according to government officials and private sector experts.   Past campaigns by the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama to thwart extremist propaganda globally were widely regarded as too reliant on fear-based rhetoric and graphic imagery to be effective.  But whether the new joint effort with the private sector will fare better remains unclear, say experts in countering extremism.  The Obama administration has had an uneasy relationship with Silicon Valley in recent years. Twitter and other tech firms have been reticent to appear too cozy with authorities on how they manage their content, though most have cautiously drifted toward being more compliant over the past year.   Facebook last year partnered with British research group Demos to examine the impact of counter-messaging against hate speech in four European countries. The study, released in October, concluded it was extremely difficult to calculate with any degree of precision whether such efforts have a real impact on long-term attitudes or offline behavior. You dont necessarily know if something is going to change the way someone thinks offline, but we can measure whether somebody shares that content or interacts with it, Monica Bickert, Facebooks head of global policy management, told Reuters. One of the new programs, funded partly by Facebook and multiple government agencies, underwrites peer-to-peer (P2P) college courses that teach students to create their own anti-militant messaging.  Facebook declined to say how much it was investing in the program, though Selim described Facebooks overall investment in CVE initiatives as very significant. Fatemah Yousef, a student at Kuwait Gulf University for Science and Technology student, flew to Washington this month to join a Facebook event showcasing counter-messaging projects created by students. Yousef, 23, exhibited a blog that encourages Kuwaiti students to denounce violent extremism on social media. Another P2P finalist, a group from the University of Arkansas, produced a video showing graphic Islamic State executions set to heavy metal band Black Sabbaths War Pigs. Half way through, the video switched to Bob Dylans The Times They Are A-Changin as captions urged viewers to raise a flag against extremism. After viewing the video, a judge in the contest told the students that probably about 90 to 95 percent of the images in the video had been used in violent extremist recruitment videos. Weve had this problem in other places where people try to instill fear in target audiences by showing all this mayhem, but it actually does the reverse with some, said the judge, Quintan Wiktorowicz, a former White House director for community partnerships. Another effort is underway at WORDE, a Muslim educational organization in Maryland, which last week launched a campaign that aims to refute Islamic State messages through catchy videos and live broadcasts of discussions about mainstream Islam.  WORDE plans to use software or survey questions to gauge the impact of its new counter-messaging campaign, said Hedieh Mirahmadi, the groups president. Everybody creates stuff but doesnt really care about whether its connected to the science of evaluations, Mirahmadi told Reuters.  Democratic New Jersey Senator Cory Booker told Reuters that he is working on two bills  one of which has already passed committee in the Senate  that would give DHS the authority to fund more college classes and research on how to best counter Islamic States slick propaganda campaigns. Government messages do not prove to have that type of virality, Booker said. The P2P program is the only private sector counter-messaging initiative that acknowledges receiving training from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but a senior FBI official said the agency provides information to other non-governmental groups whose CVE-related work may include counter-messaging. Some efforts avoid federal funding altogether.  Mohamed Magid, a Virginia imam who has counseled several youth targeted by Islamic State recruiters, leads an Islamic foundation soliciting donations to create a 24/7 online operation that would answer each Islamic State video with peaceful messages.  If we say this is a government thing, it might not have legitimacy, Magid said. Were challenging the Muslim community to say, on this, yourself, respond to the challenge.

Texas court dismisses indictment against former governor Rick Perry,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on Wednesday dismissed an abuse of power indictment against Rick Perry, ending a case that dragged on the former Texas governors unsuccessful bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Perry, who campaigned for the nomination in 2012 and 2016, faced a first-degree felony charge in state courts that could have brought up to 99 years in prison because of a funding veto he made in 2013 seen as being intended to force a Texas county district attorney to resign. When the only act that is being prosecuted is a veto, then the prosecution itself violates separation of powers, the court said. The longest serving governor in Texas history, Perry, 65, was indicted on the two charges in August 2014 by a grand jury in Travis County, a Democratic stronghold in the heavily Republican state. The courts decision today proves that this indictment was nothing less than a baseless political attack, Perry told a news conference. I have always known that the actions that I took were not only lawful and legal - they were right. He first threatened and then vetoed $7.5 million for an integrity unit in the Travis County District Attorneys office. Many said Perry played hardball politics to force out county District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat, after she pleaded guilty to drunken driving. In July 2015, a Texas state appeals court threw out a lesser charge against Perry for coercion of a public official, leaving only the abuse-of-power charge. Lawyers for Perry, whose term ended at the start of 2015, have argued the governor was acting within his powers when he made the funding cut.  A prosecutor in the case said that Perry acted unlawfully to pressure Lehmberg by threatening the funding cut. Lehmberg remained in office. In September 2015, Perry, struggling to raise money and languishing near the bottom in presidential opinion polls, became the first member of the crowded Republican field to drop out of the 2016 White House race. On the campaign trail, Perry tried to rally support among Republican voters by saying the indictment was the result of a partisan attack by Democrats. Analysts noted, however, the threat of a trial during his campaign likely scared away major donors, dooming a campaign seen as a long-shot.  Perry dropped out of a gaffe-filled campaign for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. ",politicsNews,"February 24, 2016 ",1
Senate confirms Dr. Robert Califf to lead FDA,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to confirm Dr. Robert Califf as head of the Food and Drug Administration, an agency that regulates everything from food and drugs to tobacco, cosmetics and dietary supplements. Califf, 64, a well-regarded cardiologist and researcher, takes the helm at the FDA when lawmakers are pressuring it to speed the approval process for drugs and medical devices and to finalize a proposed rule giving it authority to regulate e-cigarettes. He said one of his first priorities is to strengthen the workforce by reaching out to academic and other centers to attract new talent and create professional homes for scientists who work at the FDA. For example, he said in an interview, weve been working to create a coordinated effort to have all our statisticians have an identity and support services that they need. For docs like me, he added, that might mean help with administrative matters such as keeping medical licenses up to date. Another priority for Califf is improving surveillance systems to monitor for safety. Were not proposing to do away with the adverse event reporting system that currently exists, he said, but we are acutely aware that it is not enough.  Tools to monitor the safety of medical devices also need to be modernized, he said, and though it will not happen overnight, we have to do the hard work of making it happen. He said he thinks medical professions also need to step up and be part of the process. And he said getting the authority to regulate e-cigarettes is also a priority. The FDA is also attempting to implement sweeping new regulations to improve food safety and has begun to tackle the approval process for biosimilars, which are cheaper versions of biologic drugs. The U.S. House of Representatives recently passed the 21st Century Cures Act, which would require the FDA to consider more flexible forms of clinical trials. The Senate is considering similar legislation. The rate of new drug approvals at the FDA is higher than it has been in decades. Last year it approved 45 new drugs, the most since 1996. From 2006 through 2014 it has averaged about 28 new drug approvals per year. Lawmakers and patient groups want the agency to move even faster. Califf has worked on many high-profile clinical studies, and has said he is eager to make the clinical trial process more efficient. Four senators, including Democrat Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, opposed Califfs nomination. They took the opportunity leading up to the vote to lambaste the FDA for what they said was a lax approach to approving potentially addictive opioid painkillers. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders was also among the senators who opposed the nomination, saying Califfs ties to the pharmaceutical industry made him unfit to regulate it impartially.  Califf joined the FDA as a deputy commissioner a year ago. Previously he held senior positions at Duke University, where he founded a large academic research center that received more than half its funding from the drug industry. He has said the funding never compromised his research. Califfs confirmation was widely expected. He fills the position left by Dr. Margaret Hamburg, who stepped down after six years as commissioner. Dr. Stephen Ostroff has filled the post on an interim basis. ",politicsNews,"February 24, 2016 ",1
Detroit mayor eyes legal action over pension shortfall,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Detroit may sue some of the consultants who worked on its historic municipal bankruptcy over a $490 million pension funding shortfall that will result in bigger-than-expected city payments starting in 2024, according to Mayor Mike Duggan. In his state of the city address on Tuesday night, Duggan said he is seeking advice from the citys legal department to review any possible claims against consultants. The mayor blamed the projected deficit on outdated mortality tables used by the consultants that assume retirees will not live as long. The consultants were hired under the citys former emergency manager, Kevyn Orr. Orr, an attorney at law firm Jones Day, who was tapped by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder in 2013 to run Detroit, declined to comment. A representative of Milliman, the citys actuarial consultant, could not be reached for comment. Detroit exited the biggest-ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy in December 2014, shedding about $7 billion of its $18 billion of debt and obligations. The city paid $177 million in legal and consultant fees to dozens of firms. The citys court-approved debt adjustment plan contained money to pay for pensions over the first 10 post-bankruptcy years, according to John Naglick, Detroit finance director. The plan also projected contributions by the city starting in 2024 needed to amortize the unfunded pension liability which was understated by $490 million, he added. Detroits contribution to its two retirement systems is expected to total $194.4 million in 2024, which is $84.4 million more than anticipated in the debt adjustment plan, according to a Nov. 24 report by Detroits financial review commission. To start addressing the shortfall, Duggan said $10 million in surplus money will be tapped for pensions for this year and next. ",politicsNews,"February 24, 2016 ",1
House Republicans ready legal fight against Obama's Guantanamo plan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the House of Representatives are preparing legal action in case President Barack Obama tries to transfer detainees at the military prison at Guantanamo Bay to the United States, House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday. Ryan told reporters it would be against the law for Obama to bring detainees from the prison in Cuba to the United States, because it would violate a ban on such transfers passed by Congress in 2015. He was speaking a day after the president, seeking to make good on a pledge he made in 2008 before he was first elected to the White House, launched a final push to persuade Congress to close the military prison for foreign terrorism suspects. The Pentagon-authored plan proposes 13 potential sites on U.S. soil to hold some 30 to 60 detainees in maximum-security prisons. Obama is also considering taking executive action to close Guantanamo, situated at a U.S. naval station in southeast Cuba, if Congress does not drop its opposition. Our law is really clear, Ryan told reporters after a meeting of House Republicans. These detainees cannot come to American soil.  We are making legal preparations if the president tries to break the law, Ryan said. And what boggles my mind is that the president is contemplating directing the military to knowingly break the law.  The speaker said that Obama is trying to extend the presidents executive authority beyond its limits of the U.S. Constitution. Ryan added that not only Republicans but also many in Obamas own Democratic Party oppose detainee transfers to U.S. soil. Democrats accused House Republicans of wasting taxpayer dollars on litigation. In recent years the House Republican majority has spent nearly $3 million in this way, said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. House Republicans have spent $189,498 since November 2014 on litigation challenging the administrations Obamacare healthcare program, and recently agreed to spend up to $150,000 on legal advice on the possible Guantanamo litigation, Pelosis office said. A spokesman for Ryan, Brendan Buck, defended the spending, saying we wouldnt have to spend so much money if the president wasnt overreaching. Pelosis office said that under former House Speaker John Boehner, House Republicans spent $2.5 million defending a law that denied federal benefits to same-sex couples, before the language was struck down by the Supreme Court.

Spy agencies say Clinton emails closely matched top secret documents: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. spy agencies have told Congress that Hillary Clintons home computer server contained some emails that should have been treated as top secret because their wording matched sections of some of the governments most highly classified documents, four sources familiar with the agency reports said.  The two reports are the first formal declarations by U.S. spy agencies detailing how they believe Clinton violated government rules when highly classified information in at least 22 email messages passed through her unsecured home server.  The State Department has already acknowledged that the emails containedtop secret intelligence, though it says they were not marked that way. It has not previously been clear if the emails contained full classified documents or only some information from them.  The agencies did not find any top secret documents that passed through Clintons server in their full version, the sources from Congress and the governments executive branch said.  However, the agency reports found some emails included passages that closely tracked or mirrored communications marked top secret, according to the sources, who all requested anonymity. In some cases, additional classification markings meant access was supposed to be limited to small groups of specially cleared officials.  Under the law and government rules, U.S. officials and contractors may not transmitany classified information - not only documents - outside secure, government-controlled channels. Such information should not be sent even through the governments .gov email network.  The front-runner for the Democratic nomination for president and former secretary of state has insisted she broke no rules. Clintons lawyer, David Kendall, did not respond to a request for comment. Clinton campaign spokespeople did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  Two sources said some of the top secret material was related to the CIAs campaign of drone strikes against Islamist militants in the Middle East and South Asia.  That campaign has been widely reported by Reuters and other media outlets, but it officially is classified as a Top Secret/Special Access Program (SAP), meaning only a limited number of people whose names are on a special list are allowed to learn details about it.  One source said the reports identified some information in messages on Clintons server that came from human sources, such as confidential CIA informants, and some from technical systems, such as spy satellites or electronic eavesdropping.  The Clinton campaign criticized the State Departments decision last month to withhold the 22 emails containing top secret information from the public, blaming it on bureaucratic infighting and over-classification run amok.  As we have previously made clear, we are not going to speak to the content of the emails, a State Department official said on Wednesday when asked about the intelligence agency reports.  Clintons use of a private server in her New York home for her government work is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the State Departments and spy communitys internal watchdogs and several Republican-controlled congressional committees.  Two of the sources told Reuters that one of the reports on the emails came from the CIA. Three sources said the other report came from the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), which analyzes U.S. spy satellite intelligence.  A spokesman for NGA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. CIA spokespeople declined to comment.  The two spy agencies reports were sent to Congress in the past few weeks by the intelligence community inspector general, an official government watchdog for multiple spy agencies.  The inspector generals office has confirmed that it requested the reports from two intelligence agencies, but didnt identify them.  It was unclear what the congressional committees that received the classified reports, the House and Senate intelligence and foreign relations panels, will do with them. The contents cannot be discussed publicly. The committees requested intelligence reports in connection with their efforts to ensure that government secrets are appropriately protected.

Ex-California lawmaker Yee sentenced to five years in prison,"(Reuters) - Former California Democratic state Senator Leland Yee received a five-year prison sentence on Wednesday for conspiracy in a corruption case that involved bribery, weapons trafficking and money laundering, federal prosecutors said. Lee, 67, pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge after his arrest in 2014 in a sweep that included suspected leaders of organized crime in San Francisco, the city he represented in the state legislature. Prosecutors had sought an eight-year sentence for Yee, whose guilty plea in federal court in San Francisco last July marked the end of a long political career that included two terms on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, as well as election to the California Assembly and Senate. Yee was the third California state senator charged in 2014 in separate criminal cases. All three eventually left office, costing the Democrats a key two-thirds legislative majority.

Senators reach deal to help state water programs after Flint,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senators unveiled legislation on Wednesday providing federal aid to help states fix water infrastructure in the wake of Flint, Michigans crisis over lead-tainted drinking water.  Senators James Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, and Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, and others introduced the measure providing $100 million to a revolving fund states can tap if they have drinking water problems. The funding in the agreement is paid for by cuts from the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing loans for auto companies, aimed to speed development of electric cars and other technologies. Inhofe called it a failed program that hasnt been used in more than a year and has only issued five loans since 2008. It was unclear whether the measure would be attached to a wide-ranging energy bill that failed to advance early this month or whether the senators would try to pass it as a separate bill.  Under the plan, states must first explain how the money would be spent, according to details of the agreement. If they do not use the aid in 18 months, it would return to the federal government.  This is not a blank check, according to a document explaining the deal. Thousands of children in Flint, a predominantly African-American city of 100,000, are believed to have consumed dangerous amounts of lead in drinking water after a state-appointed emergency manager directed the city to switch from Detroits drinking water supply to the Flint River. Lead is a neurotoxin that can harm brain development in children.  Under the deal, Flint and the states would also have access to $70 million in a credit subsidy under a federal program called the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Authority, or WIFIA. Congress conceived the WIFIA to help lower borrowing costs for municipal water projects. The federal program acts as a loan guarantee, rather than a grant, and is aimed at bringing borrowing costs in line with U.S. government bond rates. Some critics say local governments need direct federal aid, not borrowing support, to improve infrastructure. There would also be $50 million in aid available for national use for a childhood lead poisoning prevention program, a health registry and other items. Earlier this month, Michigan lawmakers had at first opposed getting funding from the advanced vehicles program, saying it would hurt auto workers. ",politicsNews,"February 24, 2016 ",1
U.S. senators urge NHTSA to accelerate Takata air bag recall,"DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senators Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal on Wednesday renewed their call for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to accelerate the recall of potentially defective Takata Corp air bags. The lawmakers cited a report on Tuesday by the Senate Commerce Committee alleging Takata falsified data to cover up problems with its air bags, and said the Japanese supplier might have lied to safety regulators for years. On Wednesday, NHTSA spokesman Gordon Trowbridge said the agency has taken unprecedented efforts to address the Takata issue, including the first use of the agencys accelerated remedy authority, and that it will continue to use every tool available to make sure every American vehicle has safe air bags. Reuters reported on Monday that NHTSA continues to investigate whether the recalls of nearly 29 million defective Takata inflators in the United States should be expanded to include another 70 million to 90 million inflators with ammonium nitrate. In a statement, Markey and Blumenthal described the additional air bags as potentially lethal and ticking time bombs and said the company showed a pernicious disregard for the safety of U.S. drivers. NHTSA on Tuesday cited a consent order issued last November under which all Takata ammonium nitrate-based inflators must be recalled by 2019 unless Takata can establish their long-term safety. The agency has said that some replacement inflators may be effective for several years, but not for the full life of your vehicle, and therefore may also have to be replaced. On Wednesday, Takata said it has dramatically increased production of replacement parts and through its consent order with NHTSA is committed to a comprehensive framework to address safety concerns with airbag inflators, including through service life testing of inflators not subject to recall. Former managers interviewed by Reuters described chronic quality failures at Takatas North American plants, an assessment reflected in dozens of company emails and documents dating to 2001. Those problems, the former managers said, make it difficult for the company and regulators to pinpoint which inflators, among tens of millions, pose a danger. When exposed to moisture, ammonium nitrate can cause the inflator to rupture with deadly force, spraying shrapnel into vehicle occupants. On Tuesday, a group of 10 automakers said the cause of Takata air bag ruptures linked to 10 deaths and more than 100 injuries is a combination of exposure to humidity, design and manufacturing issues, and use of ammonium nitrate.

"Obama names first African-American, woman to be Librarian of Congress","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Baltimore library chief Carla Hayden, a defender of library users freedom from surveillance, was nominated by President Barack Obama on Wednesday to be Librarian of Congress, the first African-American and first woman in the post. Hayden, who since 1993 has served as chief executive of the Enoch Pratt Free Library, Baltimores public library system, is renowned for modernizing libraries so that users can take part in the digital culture, Obama said in a statement. She has the proven experience, dedication and deep knowledge of our nations libraries to serve our country well, Obama said in a statement. Hayden would replace Acting Librarian David Mao, who stepped in after James Billington retired in October after 28 years running the worlds largest library. If confirmed by Congress, Hayden would be the 14th Librarian of Congress. American Library Association President Sari Felman praised the nomination, saying in a statement: The president could not have made a better choice. As president of the American Library Association in 2003 to 2004, Hayden publicly opposed part of the Patriot Act, controversial legislation aimed at fighting extremism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. She objected in particular to a section of the act that gave the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation the power to access library user records. When then-Attorney General John Ashcroft said that the library association had been misled into opposing that part of the law, Hayden said the group was deeply concerned that the attorney general should be so openly contemptuous of librarians, the Library Journal reported. After the criticism from Hayden, Ashcroft dropped his refusal to make public any information about the use of that section and said it had not been employed to get access to library records, the journal said. Hayden is the former chief librarian of the Chicago Public Library, and was an assistant professor for library science at the University of Pittsburgh. Obama named her to the National Museum and Library Services Board in 2010. The Library of Congress is the U.S. oldest federal institution and has more than 158 million items. They include 36 million books and other print materials in 460 languages. Congress established the library in 1800, but British troops burned the collection in 1814. President Thomas Jefferson offered his personal library of 6,500 books as a replacement and it is the foundation of the current collection. ",politicsNews,"February 24, 2016 ",1
White House weighs possible Supreme Court nomination of Gov. Sandoval: source,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval, a Republican and a former federal judge, is being considered by President Barack Obama for a possible appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court replacing the late Justice Antonin Scalia, a source close to the process said on Wednesday. The source, who asked not to be identified, said Sandoval met on Monday in the U.S. Capitol with Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, at which time Reid asked the governor whether he would be interested in being considered for the high court job. He said he was interested, the source said, adding that a number of people are being checked out for the job. ",politicsNews,"February 24, 2016 ",1

Online bettors see Donald Trump as odds-on Republican nominee,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps chances of winning the Republican nomination for the White House shot to a record high at online betting sites around the world on Wednesday after his latest victory in voting in Nevada. Betting venues in Britain, Ireland and New Zealand show the online wagering community coalescing around Trump, once considered a rank outsider attracting long-shot odds of 200/1. Following his double-digit margin win in Nevadas Republican caucuses on Tuesday, his third victory in the first four early nominating contests, odds have tightened all the way to 1/2 in some cases. Mr Trump has triumphed yet again, despite political analysts almost unanimously writing him off as a serious presidential contender, said Graham Sharpe from William Hill, adding one customer stood to collect at least $100,000 if Trump was elected to the White House on Nov. 8.  William Hill and Betway make Trump 1/2 favorite to get the Republican nod, while Ladbrokes cut his odds to 4/9, the same as those shown on Irelands PaddyPower. His nearest rival, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio from Florida, featured odds of 6/1 on Ladbrokes. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who has been battling with Rubio for the No. 2 spot in the early voting states, has sunk to a deep longshot. Paddy Power gives Cruz odds of 33/1, its site shows. Bettors also markedly cut the odds on Trump becoming president, although he still trails Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, who won Nevadas Democratic caucuses on Saturday. Jessica Bridge from Ladbrokes said Trump was on a roll heading into Super Tuesday on March 1, when several U.S. states hold nominating contests. On PredictIt, a site operated by Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, Trumps chances of winning the Republican nod were the highest since it started tracking the race in October 2015.  A Trump bet there, on a scale of $0.00 to $1, stood at 72 cents, up 4 cents, while Rubio tumbled 7 cents to 24 cents and Cruz sank a penny to 4 cents, matching a record low.

Senate confirms Dr. Robert Califf to lead FDA,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted on Wednesday to confirm Dr. Robert Califf as Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, an agency that regulates everything from food and drugs to tobacco, cosmetics and dietary supplements. Califf, 64, is a well-regarded cardiologist and researcher who takes the helm at the FDA at a time it is under pressure from lawmakers to speed the approval process for drugs and medical devices and finalize a proposed rule giving it authority to regulate e-cigarettes. The agency is also attempting to implement sweeping new regulations to improve food safety, and has begun to tackle the approval process for biosimilars, which are cheaper versions of biologic drugs. Califfs nomination was opposed by the Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who said Califfs ties to the pharmaceutical industry made him unfit to regulate the industry impartially. It was also opposed by several senators who believe the agency needs to do more to combat opioid addiction. Several senators, including Democrat Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, took the opportunity leading up to the vote to lambaste the FDA for what they said was a lax approach to approving potentially addictive opioid painkillers.

Senator Corker: Congress won't end Cuba embargo under Obama,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee said on Wednesday he did not expect Congress to lift the half-century-long embargo against Cuba this year but it could happen under a new president, if there are changes in Havana. President Barack Obama has been moving quickly toward more normal relations with Havana in the past 14 months but the crippling trade embargo is one of the remaining major obstacles. Its not going to happen this year but I think its something that could happen as we move into a new president(s administration), Republican Senator Bob Corker told journalists at a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. If Cuba were to evolve its behavior and people were able to see results from whats happening with the executive order changes that are occurring, then I think its possible, he said. Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro announced in December 2014 that they would normalize relations after decades of hostility. Those changes have been strongly opposed by many congressional Republicans, who say Cuba needs to do more to improve human rights before trade is eased. Obama, a Democrat, has used his executive powers to ease restrictions on travel and trade. His administration just announced that next month Obama would become the first U.S. president to visit Havana since 1928. But the U.S. trade embargo, imposed on the communist-ruled nation in 1960, cannot be lifted without congressional approval. Republicans control Congress and although several agree with the overwhelming majority of Democrats who want the embargo ended, the partys congressional leaders are strongly opposed. Corker has not taken a position but has noted in the past that the embargo has not changed Cuban policy. The politics are more complicated because two Cuban-American senators vying for the Republican presidential nomination, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, are vocal opponents of Obamas policy and party leaders are unlikely to come out against them during the campaign. Corker said things are already changing, although Havana still needs to change. To me it appears that things are gradually moving along. We have air flights that are now going in, and it seems to me that this is going to be a year where those things take hold, Corker said. Obviously theres still tremendous human rights abuses that are taking place in Cuba, he said. ",politicsNews,"February 24, 2016 ",1
Pennsylvania governor Wolf has 'treatable' prostate cancer,"(Reuters) - Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf announced on Wednesday that he has a treatable form of prostate cancer but said it would not interfere with his official duties. Im not going to be incapacitated at all by this, Wolf told reporters at a news conference alongside his wife, Frances. Its eminently treatable. The 67-year-old Democrat said he would begin a months-long regimen of treatment within the coming weeks. He would not go into details of the treatment but described it as minor and routine and said it would not include chemotherapy. Wolf, a businessman, defeated Republican incumbent Tom Corbett in 2014. Since his election, the state has been locked in a bitter budget battle. It still has only a partial spending plan for the current fiscal year, which began more than seven months ago. Illinois, the U.S. state with the countrys lowest credit rating, is the only other state without a current budget in place. Wolf and the Republican-controlled state legislature have been fighting over whether to implement a severance tax on natural gas producers, among other tax hikes, and use the revenues to increase education spending. Wolf said his doctor found some abnormalities during a routine examination in late November or early December and that further testing had confirmed the cancer. Prostate cancer is something that older men get, he said. A lot of older men die with prostate cancer; not a lot die of it. He said he hoped his announcement would reinforce the importance of getting annual checkups. Other governors have also continued to work while undergoing treatment for cancer. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, 59, a Republican, pledged in June 2015 to keep working despite chemotherapy for advanced cancer of the lymph nodes. California Governor Jerry Brown, 77, a Democrat, kept a full schedule in 2012 while receiving treatment for prostate cancer. ",politicsNews,"February 24, 2016 ",1
Trump loves 'the poorly educated' ... and social media clamors,"(Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trumps declaration of love for the poorly educated in his Nevada victory speech lit up social media on Wednesday, sparking a battle between those dumbfounded by the remark and those saying it had been taken out of context.  After winning the vote of the states Republicans by a wide margin on Tuesday, the real estate billionaire rattled off a list of those groups who swept him to victory: We won with young. We won with old. We won with highly educated. We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated.  By Wednesday morning, the phrase I LOVE THE POORLY EDUCATED was trending heavily. On Twitter, it was tweeted roughly 15 times a minute, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph.  ""I am, by modern standards, poorly educated, and I think that Donald Trump is a threat to America,"" tweeted Aaron Camp (@AaronApolloCamp).  Another Twitter user, Kat (@VTweddingPhoto), wrote, This is an embarrassment. For the GOP and for us as Americans. The world is once again laughing.  Others said Trumps remark was being taken out of context, as he also touted having won the support of the highly educated.  ""To be fair with Trump, he said 'I love the highly educated and the poorly educated'. Don't take it out of context,"" tweeted Super Bowl Champs (@Josh_D_Manning).  Dan Slott (@DanSlott) was not swayed. We won the poorly educated vote. I love the poorly educated - Trump Not a joke. Not parody. Not out of context. Trump ACTUALLY said this.  Trump has won three of the four state-by-state Republican nominating contests, including Nevada, in the run-up to the party nominating convention in July and the Nov. 8 general election to succeed President Barack Obama.

"White House names new energy, climate adviser at National Security Council","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House named a new adviser to President Barack Obama on climate and energy at the National Security Council, a spokesman said on Wednesday. The adviser, John Morton, was previously the chief operating officer at the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.  He replaces Paul Bodnar, who helped push for cooperation between the United States and China on climate and for a global agreement at climate talks in Paris last year. Morton, who began his career at the World Bank, takes the job after the Supreme Court this month put a hold on Obamas Clean Power Plan to cut emissions from power plants, a major part of the presidents strategy to fight climate change. The death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia four days later may have opened a path for the rules survival. But the administrations plan could face other legal hurdles from Republicans and fossil fuel interests during Obamas last year in office. ",politicsNews,"February 24, 2016 ",1
Senate Republicans rule out action on Obama high court pick,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-led U.S. Senate on Tuesday ruled out taking  action on any nominee put forth by President Barack Obama to the Supreme Court in a political power move intended to thwart his ability to change the courts ideological balance. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate will not hold hearings or vote on any nominee to replace long-serving conservative Justice Antonin Scalia until after the next president takes office next January. Scalia died on Feb. 13. McConnell, a Republican nemesis of Obama during the presidents seven years in office, said he even would refuse the standard courtesy of meeting with whomever Obama chooses. Under the U.S. Constitution, the Senate has the power to confirm or reject a presidents Supreme Court selection. With the U.S. presidential election looming on Nov. 8, Republicans were aiming to allow the next president to fill Scalias vacancy, hoping a Republican will be elected. This nomination will be determined by whoever wins the presidency in the fall, McConnell said, adding that the overwhelming view of Senate Republicans was that this vacancy should not be filled by this lame-duck president. Obamas nominee could tip the court to the left for the first time in decades. Scalias death left the court with four liberal and four conservatives. Not since the contentious nominations by Republican presidents of Robert Bork in 1987 and Clarence Thomas in 1991 has there been such an intense fight over a Supreme Court vacancy - and Obama has yet to announce his pick.  The White House and Senate Democrats condemned McConnells stance. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid called it obstruction on steroids, adding: Gone are the days of levelheadedness and compromise. McConnell and other congressional Republicans have sought to block numerous Obama initiatives, including his signature healthcare law, the Iran nuclear deal, immigration policy and efforts to battle climate change. McConnell invoked a past statement by Obamas vice president, Joe Biden, to help justify Supreme Court inaction. McConnell noted that Biden, as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman in 1992, argued for postponing action on Supreme Court nominees during an election year. Biden has since said he was speaking hypothetically because there was no Supreme Court vacancy at the time. McConnell made his announcement after Chairman Chuck Grassley and the other Republican members of the Judiciary Committee sent him a letter saying the panel would not hold confirmation hearings. Grassley had previously left open the possibility of convening hearings. Alluding to the Nov. 8 presidential election, Republican senators told McConnell in the letter they wanted to ensure the American people are not deprived of the opportunity to engage in a full and robust debate over the type of jurist they wish to decide some of the most critical issues of our time. If the Senate does not consider a nominee until after a new president takes office, it would be unlikely that the Supreme Court would have its full complement of nine justices any sooner than early 2017. That would mean the court would be shorthanded for more than a year, hampering its ability to decide cases. In cases that end in 4-4 rulings, lower-court decisions stand and no national precedent is set. Reid said the Republican strategy was driven by the Republican partys right wing. Its what Donald Trump and Ted Cruz want, Reid said, referring to two of the Republican presidential candidates. But Reid said Senate Democrats would not become the obstruct caucus and block legislation such as appropriations bills in retaliation for the Republican inaction. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said blocking a hearing for Obamas nominee would be unprecedented and would subject the Supreme Court to the kind of politics that theyve been insulated from for more than two centuries. Since 1875, a presidents nominee has never been denied a hearing unless that president later withdrew that nomination, Earnest said. In remarks on the Senate floor, McConnell said, Presidents have a right to nominate, just as the Senate has its constitutional right to provide or withhold consent. In this case, the Senate will withhold it. Chuck Schumer, a member of the Senate Democratic leadership, predicted that the Republican position would crumble as voters put pressure on vulnerable Republican Senate incumbents seeking re-election to consider Obamas nominee. Its not just a risky strategy, its the wrong strategy and its going to fail, Schumer said of the Senate Republicans. But Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican Judiciary Committee member, countered, Im not concerned about that (public pressure). Were standing for a principle that the next president ought to resolve this problem. Democrats are badly outnumbered in the 100-member Senate, falling far short of the 60 votes needed to advance controversial legislation much less a Supreme Court nomination. Counting the two independents who caucus with them, Democrats control 46 seats, with the remaining 54 held by Republicans. ",politicsNews,"February 23, 2016 ",1
Trump's outrage finds ready audience in struggling South,"LUCEDALE, Miss (Reuters) - Mississippis vast flatlands, laced with the remains of a fading industrial base, are fertile ground for the incendiary populism of Donald Trump. For the insurgent presidential candidate, theres plenty of voter outrage to tap into here and in a swathe of other southern states that could push Trump closer to securing the Republican presidential nomination in the coming weeks. Mississippis unemployment rate is among the highest in the nation: more than 75,000 manufacturing jobs have disappeared in the past 15 years; and white voters at the core of the states Republican Party fear the rise of immigrant workers. The deep economic dislocation felt by many in Mississippi, reflected in Reuters interviews with dozens of voters, explains how Trump is attracting broad-based support in southern states, including from many evangelical Christian voters prepared to overlook his past liberal positions on touchstone social issues. In South Carolina last weekend, exit polls showed Trump comfortably beat both his closest rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio among evangelical voters, despite their more consistent appeals to Christian values. Look at immigration, look at terrorism, look at the things that really matter, said Heather Fox, a field director for the Trump campaign in Mississippi. If we dont have a country, its not going to matter about the Bible or the Constitution because we are going to be dead and gone, she added during a recent gathering of Republican voters in a Holiday Inn conference room in Lucedale, southern Mississippi, that began with a prayer.  Caleb Howell, a Baptist deacon, says even those with jobs often see little chance of promotion. There are not many options, he said, even for preachers. From the Mississippi coast through Alabama, Tennessee and the Appalachian coalfields of Kentucky, Americas economic recovery has been patchy if not outright elusive. The four-state region is the countrys least educated and least well paid, according to federal jobs data. Politically, the region has emerged as a bedrock of support for billionaire real estate mogul Trump, who has hammered home his pledge to return America to winning ways versus foreign competitors and foes. In polling conducted for Reuters by Ipsos, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky ranked among Trumps top seven states nationally, with more than 40 percent of Republicans and independent poll participants backing him. (See this graphic on census data from Trump's heartland. here) Alabama and Tennessee vote on March 1 on Super Tuesday, along with 13 other states and territories in the heated race to select the Republican Partys presidential candidate. Kentucky holds a Republican caucus on March 5 and Mississippians vote in their party primary on March 8. The 2007 to 2009 economic crisis fell particularly hard on Mississippi and neighboring states. The number of jobs fell faster than in much of the rest of the country, climbed back more slowly, and as of last year remained more than 200,000 short of where it was before the crisis, federal data show. Economic and cultural dislocation runs strong, whether its anger over Washingtons regulatory reach into industries like coal mining, the perceived threat to conservative values on issues like same-sex marriage, or the conviction that the economy no longer works for average Americans. A nation-leading 32 percent of the adult population in the four-state region has only a high school degree, a problem at a time when the fastest job and wage growth is in occupations that require a bachelors degree or more. Since 2000, jobs available in Mississippi for those with only a high school degree fell five percent, according to a Reuters analysis of federal occupational data.  Between 2000 and 2014, median household income fell nearly 12 percent in Mississippi, about twice as fast as the overall U.S. decline, adjusted for inflation. Income among white households fell slightly more than 12 percent, compared to a decline of less than five percent for all whites nationally. Were shipping out all the work and bringing in all the people that dont want to work, said Walter Wright, 46, who owns a real-estate company in Hurley, Mississippi. He said he supports Trump because of his tough build-a-wall approach to stopping illegal immigration and because he is angry. Although the region has the lowest share of foreign-born residents in the country, at fewer than four percent, and the lowest portion of Hispanic residents, whether born in the U.S. or elsewhere, the numbers have been growing. In Alabama and Mississippi, for instance, the Hispanic population more than doubled from 2000 to 2010. Thats coincided with a difficult economy. Mississippi, once a major builder of ships and furniture, has seen an exodus of thousands of jobs in both industries to China and Mexico over the past two decades. Mississippis manufacturers shed 75,738 jobs between 2000 and 2015, according to Manufacturers News Inc, a publisher and compiler of industrial directories and databases. We have had way too many industries shut down and now they are in Brazil, they are in Mexico, they are in China, said Fox. Trump has said he will bring back American jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places.  He has proposed doing this by slapping tariffs on foreign goods and negotiating better trade deals. He has threatened a 35 percent tax on Ford Motor Corp vehicles made in Mexico that are brought back to the United States to be sold. Most economists doubt Trump can revive manufacturing on its former scale in Mississippi or elsewhere, especially for unskilled workers. His threats also risk a trade war that could backfire by raising costs and hurting American jobs. While trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement may have shifted some jobs abroad, the integration of global supply chains has also helped Tennessee stand out in the region with its booming auto industry, and drawn foreign companies like Airbus to Mobile, Alabama. Republican Party officials say Trump has strong support, especially in northwest Alabama where International Paper Co shut a 43-year-old plant in 2014, laying off 1,100 workers. The day of putting on a suit and tie at 6 in the morning and getting a clean cut shave and taking your briefcase to an office somewhere, its gone, said Blake Nash, 29, a Trump supporter whose mother was let go at the plant in 2006. In Nashs town of Lexington, near the Tennessee border, red, white and blue Trump signs sprout from streets studded with Baptist churches, the only banners of any presidential candidate in the area.      Nash, who has no health insurance and calls his university degree in health sciences worthless, recently applied for a job with a company that contracts work with Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp, but was rejected because he didnt have the right training. With good jobs at home scarce, he works on contract in other states such as Texas.  Many farmers in Lauderdale County, the location of the International Paper plant, relied on the factory for their primary income, said Charlie Thompson, a farmer who worked there for 34 years and lost his job in 2014. Thompson, 58, former president of the Lauderdale County Farmers Federation, estimates that about 15percent of the sacked workers were farmers, further straining a county where the number of farms was already in decline. If you can equate signs in the yard with being popular, I would say probably Trump is a front runner around here, said Thompson. Still, a win is no sure thing. At the Lucedale forum, Chris McDaniel, a Republican state senator in Mississippi and Cruz supporter, hammered at Trumps inconsistency on conservative hot-button issues such as abortion. How sure and solid has Trump been? Just a few years ago, he was pro-choice, McDaniel said, referring to a television interview Trump gave in 1999 when he said Im very pro-choice and that he would not ban partial-birth abortions.  He has since said he is against abortion. We are kind of afraid of what he has been in the past, said Gussie Vise, 71, a retired teacher and wife of a local preacher. She is leaning toward Cruz but says of Trump,we like him. ",politicsNews,"February 24, 2016 ",1
Judge orders Clinton aides to be questioned under oath on emails,"(Reuters) - A federal judge ruled on Tuesday that U.S. State Department officials and aides to Hillary Clinton should be questioned under oath about whether the former secretary of states use of a private email system was an effort to skirt open records laws. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan is likely to add to the uncertainty hovering over Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for the November U.S. presidential election, about the legal consequences of her decision to exclusively use a private email server in her New York home for her government work. The State Department and Judicial Watch, the conservative watchdog group that sought the depositions as it sues for records about the employment of a senior Clinton aide, must agree on a plan for the depositions by April, Sullivan said in his order on Tuesday, according to court documents. Sullivan, a judge in federal court in Washington, D.C., said there was at least a reasonable suspicion that open records laws were undermined, the Washington Post reported. Sullivan, who was appointed by Clintons husband, former President Bill Clinton, said he may order the department to subpoena Clinton to return all records connected to her private email server, the newspaper reported. Clinton returned about 30,000 emails to the State Department in 2014, but said she deleted thousands of others her staff deemed not to be work-related.  Judicial Watch told the court it wanted to get sworn testimony from several senior State Department officials and Clinton associates who set up or knew about the system or dealt with requests from the public for copies of Clintons records, according to court documents. That could include Patrick Kennedy, the departments under secretary for management, and Cheryl Mills, Clintons former chief of staff at the department, among others, the group said. In a statement to the media, the group said it may later seek to have Clinton testify under oath. The State Department said it was reviewing the order but could not comment further on ongoing litigation. The department may appeal the ruling. Clinton, who apologized last year for the setup, believes at least some of the inquiries into her emails are politically motivated.  This is one of several lawsuits filed by the same right-wing group, which will stop at nothing in pursuing the Clintons, just as they have done since the 1990s, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said in an email.  At least 1,700 of the emails from Clintons unsecured server contain classified information, according to the State Department, including closely held secrets from the countrys spy agencies. The arrangement is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the State Departments internal watchdog and several Republican-controlled congressional committees. Clintons rival for the Democratic nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has declined to criticize Clintons email arrangement while campaigning. Republican opponents have not held back, with several urging that Clinton be prosecuted for mishandling government secrets.

Cruz seeks dismissal of case challenging U.S. presidential eligibility,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Republican Ted Cruz asked a federal court in Houston to throw out a lawsuit questioning whether he is eligible to be president of the United States because he was born in Canada, saying the case against him suffers from fatal deficiencies. Lawyers for Cruz contend in the filing made on Monday that the U.S. senator from Texas meets the constitutional requirements to serve as president and that the Houston lawyer trying to have the court block his bid does not have standing to bring the case. Senator Cruz is a natural-born citizen eligible to serve as President of the United States, the motion to dismiss said, adding, the plaintiff is essentially implicating the Court in a political dispute that it lacks authority to adjudicate. The lawsuit brought in January by Newton Schwartz, an 85-year-old self-described liberal, also cited Cruzs stance on issues such as abortion rights, gay marriage and the Bible in a 27-page argument against the senators eligibility. The lawsuit filed in the Southern District of Texas is a class action, meaning others can join. It requests a ruling before the Nov. 8 presidential election. Lawyers for Cruz also argue he has yet to be the Republican Partys nominee and it would be premature for a court to address the issue. Nowhere does Plaintiff, who acknowledges that he is a Democrat ... explain how he is harmed by Senator Cruzs presence on the Republican primary ballot, the Cruz filing said. Billionaire Donald Trump, the front-runner in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, has repeatedly questioned whether Cruz is eligible and warned that his winning the nomination could throw the party into chaos and hand the election to the Democrats. Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta in 1970. At the time, his mother was a U.S. citizen and his father was Cuban.  He has dismissed attacks on his eligibility and noted in the filing that 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain and 1968 Republican candidate George Romney also were born outside the United States but were considered eligible to be president.  The U.S. Constitution says a president or vice president must be a natural-born citizen but does not say whether the term means the candidate must be born on U.S. soil or just be a citizen at birth. According to legal experts, any child born to an American mother or father, no matter where, is considered a U.S. citizen. The case is Schwartz v. Cruz, 4:16-cv-00106, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston).  (Reporting by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Jonathan Oatis) This article was funded in part by SAP.

"Republican Rubio seeks boost in Nevada, but Trump dominates polls","(Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio aimed to capitalize on rival Ted Cruzs recent missteps leading up to Tuesdays Nevada caucus, where a strong finish could bolster his position as the establishment favorite for his partys nomination. Looming over the tight race between the two first-term Cuban-American U.S. senators is Republican front-runner Donald Trump, the billionaire businessman who has won two of the first three state nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election and is expected to dominate the field in Nevada. With Trump, a blunt-spoken political outsider, commanding a double-digit lead in a handful of Nevada opinion polls, political strategists in the state said Rubio and Cruz had a more modest goal: a clear win over the other, which could propel them through the busy voting month of March. Theyre playing for second, said Nevada political analyst Jon Ralston. A recent CNN/ORC poll put Trump ahead by 26 percentage points in Nevada, at 45 percent, followed by Rubio, from Florida, at 19 percent, and Cruz, from Texas, at 17 percent. Lagging behind were retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who  stoked controversy on Tuesday by suggesting that Barack Obama, the first African-American U.S. president, was raised white, and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Carson was at 7 percent and Kasich was at 5 percent. Kasich, who finished second to Trump in the Feb. 9 New Hampshire primary, kept his focus on bigger states, including Michigan and Virginia.  Trump took to Twitter as polls opened on Tuesday night to encourage voters to turn out and cast ballots for him, taking a jab at Cruz, whom he has continually described as dishonest. Make sure you get on the Trump line and are not misled by the Cruz people, he wrote. They are bad! BE CAREFUL. Hoping to gain an edge in Nevada, Cruz spent time engaging rural voters and far-right conservatives. Rubio, the son of former casino workers who spent six years in Nevada as an adolescent, played up his ties to the region. Hes not pushing it hard, like, Im really a Nevadan, said Eric Herzik, a political science professor at the University of Nevada-Reno. But both he and his surrogates have highlighted he has the best understanding of Nevada because he actually lived here. The rivalry between Rubio and Cruz, who won the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1, has intensified as both seek a boost going into the nominating contests in a dozen states on March 1, known as Super Tuesday. Rubio beat Cruz by fewer than 1,000 votes for second place in South Carolinas Republican primary on Saturday.  Strategists said Rubio was benefiting from the withdrawal of one-time establishment favorite Jeb Bush, some of whose donors were preparing to shift to Rubio immediately after Bush dropped out on Saturday night. Rubio has picked up endorsements from several Nevada party leaders since then, including U.S. Senator Dean Heller and Nevada Lieutenant Governor Mark Hutchison. He touted those gains at a campaign rally in Michigan on Tuesday, saying he was proud of supporters who had made the switch to him after Bushs exit. The Cruz campaign, meanwhile, lost a key staffer on Monday when the candidate fired his main spokesman, Rick Tyler, for posting a video that falsely showed Rubio dismissing the Bible. The firing came amid intense criticism of the Cruz campaign for unethical behavior from both Trump and Rubio. Trump, known for his blistering attacks against his rivals, continued to focus his venom on Cruz on Tuesday, writing on Twitter that he lies like a dog. Cruz aimed to quiet one of Trumps most common attacks - that he isnt eligible to run for president because he was born in Canada - on Tuesday when he asked a federal court in Houston to throw out a class-action lawsuit questioning his eligibility.

Obama makes last attempt to persuade Congress to close Guantanamo,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama launched a final push on Tuesday to persuade Congress to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, despite strong opposition from lawmakers who do not want detainees transferred to the United States. The president, a Democrat, pressed the Republican-led legislature to give his proposal a fair hearing and said he did not want to pass the issue to his successor in January. The Pentagon-authored plan proposes 13 potential sites on U.S. soil to hold some 30-60 detainees in maximum-security prisons but does not identify the facilities. U.S. law bars transfers to the United States, and lawmakers are unlikely to lift those restrictions, especially in an election year. Well review President Obamas plan, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said. But since it includes bringing dangerous terrorists to facilities in U.S. communities, he should know that the bipartisan will of Congress has already been expressed against that proposal. Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, said Obama had yet to convince Americans that moving the prisoners to the United States was smart or safe. Obama is considering taking executive action to close the facility, situated in a U.S. naval station in southeast Cuba, if Congress does not change its position. The White House declined to rule out a unilateral option on Tuesday. Republicans oppose any executive order, and issuing one would almost certainly generate legal challenges. The Guantanamo prisoners were rounded up overseas when the United States became embroiled in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. The facility came to symbolize aggressive detention practices that opened the United States to accusations of torture. Most detainees have been held without trial for more than a decade. Let us go ahead and close this chapter, Obama said at the White House. I dont want to pass this problem on to the next president, whoever it is. And if, as a nation, we dont deal with this now, when will we deal with it? Obama pledged as a presidential candidate in 2008 to close Guantanamo. Doing so would fulfill that pledge and boost his legacy during his final year in office. Pressing his case now thrust the issue into the 2016 presidential campaign. Not only are we not going to close Guantanamo - when I am president, if we capture a terrorist alive, they are ... going to Guantanamo and we are going to find out everything they know, said Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio. The plan would send detainees who have been cleared for transfer to their homelands or third countries and transfer remaining prisoners to U.S. soil to be held in maximum-security prisons. Congress has banned such transfers to the United States since 2011.      Though the Pentagon has previously noted some of the sites it surveyed for use as potential U.S. facilities, the administration wants to avoid fueling any political outcry in important swing states before the Nov. 8 presidential election. Republican Senator John McCain, Obamas 2008 presidential opponent and an advocate of closing the prison, scoffed at the plan as not being focused. Thirteen different possible sites. Thats a recommendation? he said. The White House has sought to buttress its argument for closing the prison by focusing on its high cost. Obama said nearly $450 million was spent last year alone to keep it running. The new plan would be cheaper, officials said. The transfer and closure costs would be $290 million to $475 million, an administration official told reporters, while housing remaining detainees in the United States would be $65 million to $85 million less expensive than at the Cuba facility, meaning the transfer bill would be offset in 3 to 5 years. The administration hopes sending the plan to Congress will spur lawmakers to help choose a facility they find amenable, but the White House is well aware the plan may not move at all. I am very clear-eyed about the hurdles to finally closing Guantanamo. The politics of this are tough, Obama said. Part of my message to the American people here is were already holding a bunch of really dangerous terrorists here in the United States ... and there have been no incidents.  Weve managed it just fine. The Guantanamo facility, which Obama said once held nearly 800 people, now houses 91 detainees. Some 35 prisoners will be transferred to other countries in the coming months, bringing the final number below 60, officials said. More prisoners could be transferred other countries as well, potentially lowering that number further. Obama said military commissions would continue to be used to try some of the prisoners, but he said that process also required reform. Obama noted that his predecessor, Republican President George W. Bush, transferred hundreds of prisoners out of Guantanamo and wanted it closed.  ",politicsNews,"February 23, 2016 ",1
U.S. lawmakers offer bills to counter Obama Guantanamo plan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers introduced legislation on Tuesday to counter President Barack Obamas bid to close the Guantanamo detention center, underscoring the difficulty he faces keeping a promise to close it before leaving office next year. Republican Representative Ed Royce, the chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, introduced a measure that would force the Obama administration to publicize plans for transfers from Guantanamo. Currently, the administration must inform Congress of plans for any transfers, but those notices are classified. Public notice of plans to move detainees would allow opponents more time to marshal opposition and potentially stop any transfers. This legislation will bring much needed public scrutiny to the administrations mad rush to transfer detainees out of Guantanamo Bay before President Obama leaves office, Royce said in a statement. Four other Republicans, Senators Richard Burr, Kelly Ayotte, Tom Cotton and Marco Rubio, a 2016 presidential hopeful, introduced a bill late on Monday that would bar Obama from returning the naval base at Guantanamo to Cuba without authorization from Congress. A similar bill was introduced in the House by Republican Representative David Jolly. Its clear that the threats to the United States are increasing, not decreasing, and we need every available military asset. As President Obama continues to court the Castro regime, I believe it is important that Congress makes clear that he cannot give up our base in such a strategic location, said Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.  President Obamas aggressive push to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay is dangerous, Burr said. ",politicsNews,"February 23, 2016 ",1
House Democrats introduce bill to curb company tax inversions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two leading House Democrats introduced legislation on Tuesday intended to curb corporate tax inversion deals by preventing companies from lowering the effective tax rates of U.S. business operations after moving their headquarters overseas. A bill, authored by the top Democrats on the House Ways and Means and Budget Committees, would limit the ability of newly inverted companies to engage in a tax strategy called earnings stripping, which the lawmakers said often follows an inversion deal.    Corporate inversions, an issue for anti-establishment voters in this years presidential and congressional election campaigns, typically occur when a U.S. company buys a foreign firm and then relocates its headquarters to the foreign companys home country, if only on paper, in a bid to reduce overall taxes. The Obama administration has taken policy steps to discourage such deals. But only Congress can eliminate the option through tax reform, a prospect unlikely until after the Nov. 8 election. We cannot continue to allow companies to shift their tax obligations onto American workers and families simply by changing their mailing address, said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee. Van Hollen introduced the Stop Corporate Earnings Stripping Act of 2016 with Representative Sander Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. The lawmakers said newly inverted companies have stripped their U.S. operations of taxable earnings by loading them with debt that produces tax-deductible interest payments. The payments are made to the new foreign parent or another foreign affiliate as interest income that often pays a reduced or zero tax rate. The new legislation would reduce or eliminate financial thresholds that allow companies to pursue the earnings-stripping strategy after inversion. ",politicsNews,"February 23, 2016 ",1
"Ben Carson says Obama was 'raised white,' sparking Twitter furor","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Ben Carsons comments that President Barack Obama was raised white prompted backlash on social media on Tuesday, with many users criticizing the neurosurgeon for stereotyping the experience of African-Americans. Carson, who is black and grew up poor in Detroit in the 1960s, said of Obama in a podcast posted on Politicos website, He was, you know, raised white. He added, I mean, like most Americans, I was proud that we broke the color barrier when he was elected, but  he didnt grow up like I grew up  Many of his formative years were spent in Indonesia. So, for him to, you know, claim that, you know, he identifies with the experience of black Americans, I think, is a bit of a stretch. Several Twitter users expressed anger over the remarks.   Keith Simmons (@Foreignstorian) said You cannot distill the black experience into something so narrow. Being poor or rich does not grant authenticity. Warren Holstein (@WarrenHolstein) said, Ben Carson says Obama was raised white and doesnt understand black Americans. That fails to explain why no one understands Ben Carson. Shaun King (@ShaunKing), civil rights activist and New York Daily News writer, said, Please @RealBenCarson. Step away from ALL microphones...forever. Saying Obama grew up white is foolishness. The comments also prompted some to contemplate Obamas upbringing. Brahma Chellaney (@Chellaney) said, Ive often wondered why Obama is regarded as black, not mixed race, despite a white mother and a white upbringing. Carson did not back away from his comments in an interview with CNN on Tuesday afternoon. Anybody who is sensible knows that the way that he was brought up is very different from the way most black people in this country are brought up, he said, adding, I dont think anyone would deny that someone who was raised in Hawaii by his white grandparents and then spent formative years in Indonesia with his white mother does not have the typical black experience.

Senate leader McConnell sees 'no action' on Obama court pick,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday said the Republican-led chamber will refuse to consider anyone President Barack Obama nominates to become a Supreme Court justice. Citing overwhelming consensus among Senate Republicans that the next president, who will take office in January, should select a replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia, McConnell told reporters there will be no action taken on Obamas pick.

"Senators push protections for opioid-dependent parents, infants","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Key senators said on Tuesday they are crafting a law that would allow states to use federal foster care funds to help opioid-addicted parents raise their infants. The senior Republican and Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee envision the law as part of a comprehensive effort to address the opioid crisis with increased prevention, treatment and law enforcement. Children and families are relying on us to take this important step, committee chairman Sen. Orin Hatch, a Republican of Utah, said during the hearing. The committees ranking Democrat, Ron Wyden of Oregon, cited a recent Reuters investigation, which documented 110 preventable deaths of infants sent home with opioid-addicted parents ill-prepared to care for them. One drug-dependent baby is born in the United States every 19 minutes, the series found. A parents drug addiction is becoming a growing reason for removing children from their homes and placing them in foster care, Wyden said. Hatch and Wyden described only the general scope of the bill they planned to introduce. They did not offer specifics for the Family First Act, but their staffers said the money would likely come from existing funds. Nancy Young, director of Children and Family Futures, which provides services to government welfare programs, testified that parental opioid use before and after birth places a profound strain on the foster care system. Shifting foster care funds to help parents cope with addiction will reduce costs, she said, in part because it will help keep mothers and infants together. We have the knowledge  we can no longer say we dont know what to do, said Young, who cited statistics from the Reuters investigation to describe the scope of the crisis. Last month, responding to the report, a House committee overseeing child abuse opened an inquiry into whether the federal government is failing to enforce a federal law meant to protect thousands of babies born dependent on drugs each year. Reuters found that no more than nine states comply with a law that calls on hospitals to alert social workers whenever such a baby is born, and help them develop a plan of safe care. Federal health and drug officials have declined to comment and, according to a congressional staffer, have not responded to the House queries. ",politicsNews,"February 23, 2016 ",1

N.C. city's vote to expand transgender rights draws state opposition,"(Reuters) - A top North Carolina lawmaker vowed on Tuesday to correct the radical course taken by leaders in Charlotte, the states largest city, after they voted to allow transgender people to use public bathrooms matching their gender identity. The Charlotte City Council expanded the citys nondiscrimination ordinance late on Monday to add protections for marital and familial status, sexual orientation, gender expression and gender identity. A provision that permits bathroom choice based on gender identity drew opposition ahead of the 7-4 vote from Christian evangelist Franklin Graham and North Carolinas Republican governor, Pat McCrory, a former mayor of Charlotte. State House of Representatives Speaker Tim Moore, a Republican, said he would consider legislation to block the measure, which some critics fear would allow sexual predators to gain access to womens bathrooms.  The Charlotte City Council has gone against all common sense and has created a major public safety issue by opening all bathrooms and changing rooms to the general public, Moore said in a statement. I join my conservative colleagues and Governor McCrory in exploring legislative intervention to correct this radical course, he added. Civil rights groups rejected the public safety concerns as overblown. They praised the council for passing what they said was the first ordinance in the state to prohibit discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender people in public accommodations, including restaurants, hotels and taxis. Charlotte was one of the largest U.S. cities without a law explicitly protecting the LGBT community from discrimination, according to the Human Rights Campaign, a civil rights group based in Washington. The revised law takes effect on April 1.  Charlotte has full authority to enact this ordinance, and we hope the General Assembly will respect this local governments decision to protect its residents and visitors from discrimination, said Sarah Preston, acting executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina.  Voters in Houston, the fourth most populous U.S. city, last fall rejected a similar measure that would have banned discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation and let transgender men and women use bathrooms that corresponded with their gender identity.

Italy summons U.S. ambassador after reports U.S. spied on Berlusconi,"ROME (Reuters) - Italys foreign ministry summoned the U.S. ambassador on Tuesday after media reports that American intelligence services tapped the telephones of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and his aides in 2011. Newspaper La Repubblica reported the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) spied on the billionaire, four-time prime minister five years ago when his government was under pressure at the height of the euro zone debt crisis. La Repubblica said whistleblowing site WikiLeaks showed the 79-year-old media tycoon and head of Italys main center-right party had been in the NSAs crosshairs between 2008 and 2011. Ambassador John Phillips met the director general of the foreign ministry, Michele Valensise, in the afternoon. Afterwards the ministry issued a statement saying that Italy had called for specific clarifications about what emerged in relation to the events of 2011. Phillips assured us that he will immediately refer the question to his superiors, the ministry said. During the meeting, Phillips also pointed out that President Barack Obama banned eavesdropping on the leaders of close friends and allies of the United States in 2014, the statement said. Obama made that decision in part to smooth over frayed relations between the United States and Germany after reports surfaced in 2013 that the NSA had monitored the cellphone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Though Berlusconis influence has waned since he left government, he is still a prominent figure and leads Forza Italia, the second-largest party on the fragmented right wing of Italian politics.  Jewels in the crown of his business empire include TV company Mediaset and a majority stake in football team AC Milan.  Germanys federal prosecutor opened an investigation into the alleged tapping of Merkels mobile phone by the NSA but closed it after a year in June 2015, saying there was a lack of evidence that would stand up in court. Staunch Berlusconi ally and Forza Italia member Renato Brunetta said there had been a conspiracy to bring down Berlusconi, and warned current Prime Minister Matteo Renzi not to take the allegations too calmly.  Lets not forget how the ratings agencies downgraded Italy for no reason other than to push Berlusconi out, Brunetta said on Twitter. In the past, Berlusconi has repeatedly accused European Union officials of a plot to force him out of government. Berlusconi resigned in November 2011 and was replaced by former European Commissioner Mario Monti. A book by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner released in Italy in 2014 suggested EU officials had approached the United States with a project to force Berlusconi to step down.

"U.N. welcomes Obama Guantanamo plan, but calls for due process","GENEVA (Reuters) - The top U.N. human rights official welcomed President Barack Obamas plan announced on Tuesday to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, but stressed that no detainee should remain in indefinite custody without charge or trial. Zeid Raad Al Hussein, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said the U.S. facility in Cuba had been a serious blot on the human rights record, and reputation, of the United States for the past 14 years. All Guantanamo detainees should either be transferred to regular detention centers in the U.S. mainland or other countries where fair trials before civilian courts and due process guarantees can be provided in accordance with international norms and standards, he said in a statement. If there is insufficient evidence to charge them with any crime, they must be released to their home country, or to a third country if they risk persecution at home.

"Cruz says would deport illegal immigrants, sharpens immigration stance","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz vowed to deport immigrants living illegally in the United States and build a wall to keep others out, sharpening his stance on the issue a week before presidential contests in several southern states. Cruzs comments on the eve of Tuesdays Nevada caucuses came hours after the public firing of his main spokesman over misleading social media postings involving rival Marco Rubio. Rubio won endorsements on Monday from prominent Republicans as he sought to become the partys mainstream alternative to front-runner Donald Trump after Jeb Bush dropped out of the race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Cruz was asked on Fox News OReilly Factor if he would round up the 12 million illegal aliens in the country, and how. Listen, we should enforce the law. How do we enforce the law?Yes, we should deport them.We should build a wall. We should triple the Border Patrol, Cruz said. And federal law requires that anyone here illegally thats apprehended should be deported. Asked if he, like real estate tycoon Trump, would go out and look for them, Cruz replied, Of course you would.Thats what ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) exists for. We have law enforcement that looks for people who are violating the laws. The comments marked a shift from last month, when Cruz rejected sending authorities to find immigrants as police state tactics. I dont intend to send jackboots to knock on your door and every door in America. Thats not how we enforce the law for any crime, Mr. Cruz told CNN in an interview on Jan. 10. Cruz has repeatedly criticized Rubio for having embraced a sweeping immigration reform bill he characterizes as amnesty.  Cruz and other Republican candidates vying to represent their party in the Nov. 8 presidential election have been under pressure to toughen their stance on immigration by Trumps ferocious rhetoric on the issue. Trump responded to Cruzs comments with a trademark Twitter taunt on Tuesday, referring the U.S. senator from Texas third-place finish in South Carolinas primary on Saturday. Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration, Trump said. The New York billionaire has said he would deport all undocumented immigrants, build a wall and rescind U.S. President Barack Obamas executive orders on immigration.

"Rubio gets boost from Republican endorsements, Cruz missteps","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio received boosts Monday in his drive to become the mainstream Republican alternative to front-runner Donald Trump, with a string of high-profile endorsements and missteps by rival Ted Cruzs campaign. Rubio, who eked out a second-place finish in South Carolinas primary by fewer than 1,000 votes over Cruz on Saturday, racked up endorsements from prominent Republicans including U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and former presidential candidate Bob Dole. Rubio and Cruz came out of South Carolina with sharper criticism of Trump, who swept the Southern state with a comfortable margin of victory. At the same time, the two senators rivalry intensified - and soured. Cruz fired his main spokesman, Rick Tyler, on Monday afternoon over a video that falsely showed Rubio dismissing the Bible.  Tyler had apologized late on Sunday for posting an inaccurate story involving a video purporting to show Rubio referring to the Bible and saying, Not many answers in it. Tyler had retweeted a link to the misleading video and posted it on Facebook. Cruz fired Tyler the next day, saying his campaign did not question the faith of other candidates. Thats why Im asking for Rick Tylers resignation, Cruz said. The first-term senators from Texas and Florida are locked in a battle to become their partys alternative to political outsider Trump in Nevadas caucus on Tuesday, the last Republican presidential contest before the busy voting month of March.  Tylers dismissal came amid intense criticism of the Cruz campaign as dishonest from both Rubio and Trump. Rubio spokesman Alex Conant called Cruz a candidate willing to do or say anything to get elected and urged him to apologize.  There is a culture in the Cruz campaign, from top to bottom, that no lie is too big and no trick too dirty, he said. Trump seized the opportunity to pile on Cruz, whom he has repeatedly characterized as a liar.  Wow, Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks! the billionaire businessman from New York said on Twitter. Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!, continued Trump, who has derided Cruz for failing to live up to expectations he would get solid support from evangelical Christians in South Carolina.  Trump was the big winner in that state on Saturday, finishing ahead of Rubio by 10 percentage points.  Opinion polls show Rubio and Cruz running close in Nevada, and both candidates hope to get a boost going into the contests in a dozen states on March 1. Super Tuesday is the crown jewel in the state-by-state nominating contests to pick the Republican and Democratic candidates for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Rubio on Monday also secured the backing of three Republican leaders from Nevada: U.S. Senator Dean Heller and U.S. Representatives Cresent Hardy and Mark Amodei.   Senator Hatch said that, unlike many in the Republican establishment, he did not dislike Trump. I just feel that Rubio is the more serious candidate. And I feel he has the background to be able to really help turn this mess around, Hatch told Reuters.

Trump on rival Bush's exit: Don't look at me,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has for months rained withering ridicule on onetime party favorite Jeb Bush, on Sunday refused to take responsibility for the former Florida governors exit from the 2016 White House race. I just dont know what did him in, Trump, who won South Carolinas Republican primary election handily on Saturday, said in an interview on CNN. Trump had repeatedly made Bush the target of pointed attacks throughout his campaign for the Republican nomination to run in the Nov. 8 general election, labeling him weak, low-energy and an embarrassment to the Bush political dynasty. On Sunday, Trump denied any role he may have played in taking down Bush, who ended his campaign on Saturday night after a fourth-place finish in South Carolina. Jeb fought very hard, the billionaire businessman said. It wasnt his time. Thats all. Bush, the brother of one president and the son of another, had prided himself as the only candidate to attack Trump head-on throughout the campaign and frequently accused him of lacking ideas. He appeared to take one last jab at Trump in his concession speech on Saturday, saying: Despite what you may have heard, ideas matter. Policy matters. Sounding less like his normally combative self, Trump on Sunday credited Bush in a pair of interviews with having fought hard in the campaign and called him very capable. Those last couple of weeks he was on television so much, I was looking,  Id say, Man, Ive never seen anything like this, Trump said on CNN. He did, however, chide Bush for having run brutal negative ads against him, saying he was a little bit offended. So, you know, this is a tough business, I will tell you, the billionaire real-estate mogul said of presidential politics. I think real estate in Manhattan is a lot easier.

Rubio denies report on Romney White House endorsement: CNN,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Marco Rubio denied a report on Sunday that a high-profile endorsement by former Republican White House nominee Mitt Romney is on the horizon. The Huffington Post reported that Romney was scheduled to throw his backing behind the U.S. senator from Florida in the 2016 White House race, Rubio called the reports untrue and said no endorsement was forthcoming. That report is false, Rubio said on CNNs State of the Union. I dont know where those reports are coming from. Romney has previously said he would not endorse a candidate until the partys nominee had been selected.

"More Californians register to vote but fewer are Republicans, state says","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - More people have registered to vote in California since the last major election in 2012, but the number of Republicans in the Democrat-dominated state continues to drop, according to state data released. Democrats hold all statewide elective offices and large majorities in both houses of the legislature in the most populous U.S. state. There were just under 4.8 million Republicans registered in the state as of Jan. 3, down from nearly 5.2 million in early January 2012, the last presidential election cycle, Secretary of State Alex Padilla said Monday. Republicans accounted for 27.62 percent of registered voters in California, down from 30.36 percent in 2012, according to the data, which was posted on Padillas state website. Most of that change was reflected in the number of voters registering as independents, which went up by just under 3 percent. In January 2016, the number of Californians indicating that they preferred not to state a party preference was 4.1 million, up from 3.6 million in 2012. Independents accounted for 24 percent of all registered voters in 2016, up from about 21 percent in 2012. The number of Democrats remained about the same at roughly 7.4 million. The number of people registered to vote in California rose by about 231,000 since 2012 to 17.3 million.

"Rubio gets boost from Republican endorsements, Cruz missteps","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio received boosts Monday in his drive to become the mainstream Republican alternative to front-runner Donald Trump, with a string of high-profile endorsements and missteps by rival Ted Cruzs campaign. Rubio, who eked out a second-place finish in South Carolinas primary by fewer than 1,000 votes over Cruz on Saturday, racked up endorsements from prominent Republicans including U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and former presidential candidate Bob Dole. Rubio and Cruz came out of South Carolina with sharper criticism of Trump, who swept the Southern state with a comfortable margin of victory. At the same time, the two senators rivalry intensified - and soured. Cruz fired his main spokesman, Rick Tyler, on Monday afternoon over a video that falsely showed Rubio dismissing the Bible.  Tyler had apologized late on Sunday for posting an inaccurate story involving a video purporting to show Rubio referring to the Bible and saying, Not many answers in it. Tyler had retweeted a link to the misleading video and posted it on Facebook. Cruz fired Tyler the next day, saying his campaign did not question the faith of other candidates. Thats why Im asking for Rick Tylers resignation, Cruz said. The first-term senators from Texas and Florida are locked in a battle to become their partys alternative to political outsider Trump in Nevadas caucus on Tuesday, the last Republican presidential contest before the busy voting month of March.  Tylers dismissal came amid intense criticism of the Cruz campaign as dishonest from both Rubio and Trump. Rubio spokesman Alex Conant called Cruz a candidate willing to do or say anything to get elected and urged him to apologize.  There is a culture in the Cruz campaign, from top to bottom, that no lie is too big and no trick too dirty, he said. Trump seized the opportunity to pile on Cruz, whom he has repeatedly characterized as a liar.  Wow, Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks! the billionaire businessman from New York said on Twitter. Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!, continued Trump, who has derided Cruz for failing to live up to expectations he would get solid support from evangelical Christians in South Carolina.  Trump was the big winner in that state on Saturday, finishing ahead of Rubio by 10 percentage points.  Opinion polls show Rubio and Cruz running close in Nevada, and both candidates hope to get a boost going into the contests in a dozen states on March 1. Super Tuesday is the crown jewel in the state-by-state nominating contests to pick the Republican and Democratic candidates for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Rubio on Monday also secured the backing of three Republican leaders from Nevada: U.S. Senator Dean Heller and U.S. Representatives Cresent Hardy and Mark Amodei.   Senator Hatch said that, unlike many in the Republican establishment, he did not dislike Trump. I just feel that Rubio is the more serious candidate. And I feel he has the background to be able to really help turn this mess around, Hatch told Reuters.

Republican Kirk breaks with U.S. Senate leaders on high court seat,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Mark Kirk, facing a tough re-election fight in Illinois, said on Monday the Senate should vote on whomever President Barack Obama nominates to the U.S. Supreme Court, breaking with his partys leadership. In another defection among Republicans, Senator Susan Collins of Maine called for hearings on the eventual nominee.  A political fight has erupted over filling the courts vacancy left by the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, with many top Republicans threatening to block any nominee put forth by the Democratic president. Obamas nominee could shift the court to the left for the first time in decades. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the seat should remain vacant until Obamas successor takes office in January so voters can have a say on the selection when they cast ballots in the November presidential election. Kirk wrote in a Chicago Sun-Times opinion piece that he recognized the right of any president to choose a Supreme Court nominee and he looked forward to Obama picking one for the Senate to consider for confirmation. I also recognize my duty as a senator to either vote in support or opposition to that nominee following a fair and thorough hearing along with a complete and transparent release of all requested information, Kirk added. Kirk, who holds Obamas old Senate seat, said he hoped the president would pick a nominee who can bridge differences, a nominee who finds common ground and a nominee who does not speak or act in the extreme. Kirks stance illustrates that McConnell may have trouble keeping Senate Republicans fully united over filling Scalias seat. Some senators like Kirk are seeking re-election this year in states where Democrats are competitive. Collins, who is not facing re-election until 2020, said on Monday the Senate had an obligation to hold public hearings on Obamas nominee. The kind of thorough process that a hearing allows is the best way to evaluate a nominee, Collins told reporters, according to the Hill newspaper. But it appeared unlikely that enough Republicans would peel away from McConnell to allow a vote on the Senate floor.     Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah said on Monday it was up to McConnell and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley to decide whether to hold confirmation hearings. I feel like we ought to put it off and get it out of this harsh atmosphere, Hatch told reporters. ",politicsNews,"February 22, 2016 ",1
Pentagon to submit plan to Congress for closing Guantanamo prison,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon is expected to submit to Congress on Tuesday President Barack Obamas long-awaited plan for closing the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, setting up a battle with lawmakers who oppose his efforts. Obama, whose pledge to shut the facility at the U.S. naval base in Cuba dates back to the start of his presidency in 2009, is seeking to make good on his promise before he leaves office next January. Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said the administration intended to meet Tuesdays deadline to present its detailed proposal for closing the facility. There are still 91 prisoners detained there. We understand the deadline is tomorrow and its our intent to meet it, Davis told reporters. U.S. officials have said the plan would call for sending to their homelands or third countries detainees who have been cleared for transfer, now numbering 35, and bringing remaining prisoners, possibly several dozen, to U.S. soil to be held in maximum-security prisons. Congress has banned such transfers to the United States since 2011. Another option that will be cited in the administrations blueprint will be the possibility of sending some prisoners overseas for prosecution and trial, one U.S. official said. The closure plan could also serve as a template for how to deal with future terrorism suspects captured in the fight against the Islamic State militant group. However, the document will not name the alternative U.S. prisons under consideration for housing detainees, U.S. officials said. The administration wants to avoid fueling any political outcry over specific sites during a U.S. presidential election year. Still, Pentagon officials have already surveyed a federal prison in Florence, Colorado, a military jail at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and the Navy brig at Charleston, South Carolina. An effort will also be made to speed up parole-style reviews to determine whether more prisoners can be added to the group cleared for release, officials said. The plan will include costs for upgrading U.S. facilities and housing the inmates there, according to a source familiar with the matter. The White House last year rejected one Pentagon proposal as too expensive, sending it back for revisions. Republicans and some Democrats in Congress largely oppose proposals to move any of the prisoners to the United States. Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte said on Monday the Obama administration refused to level with the American people regarding the terrorist activities and affiliations of the detainees who remain at Guantanamo. White House spokesman Josh Earnest reiterated Obamas view of Guantanamo as a terrorist recruiting tool and urged lawmakers to look at the plan with an open mind, although he expressed doubt about whether they would do so. The White House has left open the possibility that Obama might resort to executive powers to close the facility. The prison was opened in 2002 by former Republican President George W. Bush to house foreign terrorism suspects rounded up after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. The United States quickly drew criticism from human rights activists and foreign governments over Guantanamo, where most prisoners have been held for more than a decade without trial.

California lawmaker aims to reduce eating disorders among fashion models,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - Fashion models who want to work in California would need a doctor to attest that they are of healthy weight and not suffering from an eating disorder under a proposal announced by a state lawmaker on Monday. The bill proposed by California state Assembly member Marc Levine follows efforts in several countries to fight anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders among models, who are relentlessly pressured to lose weight or lose work. The evidence of eating disorders in the modeling industry is alarming, Levine, a Democrat who represents the Marin County suburbs of San Francisco, said in a statement on Monday. Under his bill, which was introduced Feb. 19, modeling agencies would have to be licensed by the California Labor Commissioner, and could be fined if they hire models who do not have a physician certifying that they are healthy. The bill, if passed, directs the states Department of Public Health and the Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board to adopt rules for the health of fashion models that would include periodic health checkups, nutrition consultations and medical testing. Levine said the measure, which must pass numerous committees, both houses of the legislature and be signed by Democratic Governor Jerry Brown before it could take effect, would also help girls and women, who see impossibly thin models in magazines and aim to be like them. As a former fashion model and an eating disorder survivor, I know that this legislation is critically needed, Nikki DuBose, a former model turned advocate, said in a statement. Last spring, France banned excessive thinness in models, partly in response to the death in 2010 of Isabelle Caro, a 28-year-old former French fashion model who died from anorexia after posing for a photographic campaign to raise awareness about the illness. Israel enacted a similar measure in 2013, while other countries, like Italy and Spain, rely on voluntary codes of conduct to protect models. As many as 40 percent of fashion models may suffer from eating disorders, Levine said. These include anorexia nervosa, which leads sufferers to starve themselves; bulimia nervosa, which involves binge-eating followed by purges such as forced vomiting, consumption of laxatives or excessive exercise; and binge-eating disorder.

Republican candidate Kasich's 'kitchen' comment draws scorn,"(Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate John Kasich drew scorn on Monday after a video emerged in which he told a crowd that early in his career, he gleaned support from women who left their kitchens to campaign.  The comments were made in reference to his 1978 run for Ohios state Senate, according to a spokesman, and not his current presidential campaign, in which he is running fifth nationally for the Republican nomination, Reuters-Ipsos polling shows.  We just got an army of people who, and many women, who left their kitchens to go out and go door-to-door and to put yard signs up, Kasich says in footage of Mondays event in Virginia.  Kasich, 63, added his first campaign took place in an era in which things were different.  Now you call homes and everybodys out working, Kasich said.  He apologized for the remark later on Monday.  Of course, Im more than happy to say Im sorry if I offended somebody out there but it wasnt intended to be offensive and if you hear the whole thing, youll understand the context of it, Kasich told CNN.  In the video, an unseen audience member seems to criticize the Ohio governor for his comment.  I want to say, your comment earlier, about the women came out of the kitchen to support you: Ill come to support you but I wont be coming out of the kitchen.  The response on social media was swift and negative, with many Twitter (TWTR.N) users decrying Kasichs anecdote as sexist.  Its 2016. A womans place is...wherever she wants it to be, wrote Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) on Monday, in a quotation retweet that refers to Kasichs comments about his first campaign.  Kasich press secretary Rob Nichols told Reuters the governors political campaigns have always been homegrown affairs.  Many of his early campaign teams were made up of stay-at-home moms who believed deeply in the changes he wanted to bring, Nichols said. Hes proud of that authentic support. To try and twist his comments into anything else is just desperate politics.  Some social media users compared Kasichs comment to former Republican candidate Mitt Romneys binders full of women moment from the 2012 presidential campaign, when he described receiving many resumes from women. The comment struck many at the time as tone deaf.  Mitt had binders full of women, and Kasich has kitchens full of women, tweeted Chicago Jesus (@Patriot_Musket).

Senate moves closer to confirming Califf to lead FDA,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate on Monday moved closer to confirming Dr. Robert Califf to lead the Food and Drug Administration, overriding opposition from several senators who had sought to block a vote on the issue. In a procedural move designed to prevent the opponents from blocking the confirmation indefinitely, the Senate voted 80 to 6 in favor of limiting further debate on the matter to no more than 30 hours, meaning a confirmation vote could take place as early as Tuesday. Democrats Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Joe Manchin of West Virginia among others had sought to block the confirmation vote citing disagreements with the FDAs process for approving opioid painkillers.  Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders also placed a hold on the nomination, saying he objected to Califfs close ties to the pharmaceutical industry. Under pressure, the FDA recently agreed to a number of changes to its opioid approval process, and said it would convene an advisory panel meeting before approving new opioid painkillers that do not include an abuse-deterrent feature. The opponents said the measures do not go far enough and that advisory panels should be called before any opioid is approved.  The FDA has to be the cop on the beat, Markey said. Before the vote opponents, including Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, took to the floor to berate the FDA for approving opioid products such as Zohydro over the objections of its advisory committee. The FDA, Manchin added, must break its cozy relationship with the pharmaceutical industry. He said more people die of legal prescription drug abuse in West Virginia than any other cause.

Illinois governor eyes blocking Chicago school debt,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner said on Monday the state has the power to block any debt offerings by financially distressed school districts, including the cash-strapped Chicago Public Schools (CPS), which has been dependent on borrowing to fund operations.  The Republican governor last week launched a financial probe of the nations third-largest public school system through the Illinois State Board of Education. Rauner, who has called for a state takeover of the school district, said the board has the legal authority to block borrowings by districts found to be in financial duress.   The state board has never chosen to do that for the city of Chicago. I hope that never becomes necessary. But weve got to be ready to take action, Rauner told reporters. Rauners office pointed to a provision of the school code that it says applies to CPS. The provision prohibits the sale of bonds, notes or other debt by a district certified to be in financial difficulty until a financial plan is approved by the state board of education. CPS Chief Executive Forrest Claypool contended that the authority Rauner seeks to exercise does not apply to CPS, according to a school district spokeswoman. CPS is struggling with a $1.1 billion structural budget deficit, caused largely by escalating annual pension payments that will reach $676 million this fiscal year. The districts efforts to gain an additional $480 million in state dollars to pay its pension bill have become entangled in an ongoing impasse between Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature. To keep operating in anticipation of $1 billion in property tax revenue next month, CPS turned to short-term borrowing and a $725 million bond sale earlier this month for cash flow. The district said it plans to seek additional short-term borrowing authority from its governing board in the future. Rauner said accusations by Chicago officials that he attempted to derail the Feb. 3 bond sale by pushing for a state takeover or possible bankruptcy for CPS were completely false. Skittish investors demanded hefty yields for the junk-rated bonds, which will cost the district nearly $1.9 billion to pay off by 2044. ",politicsNews,"February 22, 2016 ",1

Top tech official at hacked U.S. personnel agency retires under pressure,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top technology official at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management announced her retirement on Monday amid calls for her ouster by some Republican lawmakers. Donna Seymour, chief information officer, said in an email to her colleagues that was seen by Reuters that leaving was a very tough decision. She added that she felt it was in the agencys best interest that my presence does not distract from the great work this team does every single day. House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz had repeatedly called for Seymours resignation, lodging complaints that her mistakes helped lead to the OPM data breach disclosed last year that exposed the personal information of 22 million individuals. In response to the sudden announcement, Chaffetzs panel canceled a hearing scheduled for Wednesday to examine the breach. In a statement, Chaffetz called the retirement good news but said he was disappointed she would no longer testify. On her watch, whether through negligence or incompetence, millions of Americans lost their privacy and personal data, Chaffetz said. Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the oversight panel, countered that Republican efforts to blame Seymour for the hack were unfair and inaccurate and would discourage qualified technical professionals from pursuing public service. Seymour is the second high-ranking official to leave OPM since the breach was disclosed. Katherine Archuleta, the agencys director, resigned in July. Earlier this month, Chaffetz subpoenaed OPM for documents related to the hack, which intelligence officials have privately blamed on China.  The Utah Republican has accused the agency of not acting in good faith with the committee because it has only provided partially redacted versions of the files, which were described by Seymour as outdated security documents in testimony she gave in June 2015. Chaffetz has expressed concern that the manuals could be used to launch another cyber attack. Beth Cobert, the acting head of OPM, praised Seymours 37-year career in federal government in a statement and lauded her for helping to modernize the agencys information technology over the past year.

"Clinton, Sanders race takes on angrier tone after Nevada","(Reuters) - The race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders for the U.S. Democratic presidential nomination - once a civil affair - has taken a sour turn, with mud-slinging from both camps over the former secretary of states win in the Nevada caucuses.  Sanders supporters are alleging that foul play by casino managers helped Clinton out in Saturdays contest, while Clintons camp has blasted - in at times vulgar terms - the Vermont senators assertion he took the states Latino vote. The tensions reflect the tight battle between the two heading into next Saturdays South Carolina primary. Sanders, who had surged in recent months to challenge front-runner Clinton, is trying to maintain momentum against her in a part of the United States where she wields an advantage among minority voters.     The angrier tone also marks a turn from what has been a mostly civil race on the Democratic side, in contrast with the noisy insult-hurling that has characterized much of the Republican race. . While Sanders and the former first lady have publicly clashed on their approaches to healthcare and regulating Wall Street, they have frequently emphasized their common ground on social issues. Sanders has also refused so far to join in Republican attacks on Clintons record as secretary of state. Lets talk about the real issues facing America, he said during one televised debate. The tone soured after Nevada. Officials with National Nurses United, which endorsed Sanders, have said there were irregularities at casino caucus sites - such as casino managers wearing Clinton paraphernalia - which they said amounted to intimidation of casino employee voters. From what nurses observed in Nevada Sanders campaign should call for UN observers to protect democracy, the union said in one Twitter post on Sunday. Neither Clinton nor Sanders campaigns immediately responded to requests for comment on the allegations. Meanwhile, both campaigns have argued about what the polling from the Nevada caucuses show. One set of entrance and exit poll results conducted by CBS News showed Sanders took 53 percent of Latino votes in the state. This is a critical group for Sanders as he seeks to broaden his support base after his early results - a very narrow loss and a decisive win - in Iowa and New Hampshire, which have overwhelmingly white voter populations. I dont typically like to swear on Twitter, but by all accounts so far this is complete and utter bullshit, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill wrote on Twitter, referring to a Sanders campaign press release asserting he took the Latino bloc in Nevada. Clinton has been expected to find easier territory as  contests move into the south in the state-by-state battles to pick a party presidential nominee for the November general election. Her backers say minority voters are her firewall against Sanders popularity among young voters who dislike establishment politics and are attracted by his vows to take on Wall Street excesses and high college fees. She won Nevada, which is nearly a quarter Latino, by just over 5 points. Sanders camp, meanwhile, has disputed Clinton camp assertions that she drew the lions share of the union votes in the Nevada contest, accusing her campaign of inventing figures.  They do have a tendency to make stuff up, Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said in an email. The American Federation of Teachers issued a press release on Monday listing 23 unions that back Clinton.

Republican Rubio scores more endorsements for president,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio racked up a number of endorsements from party leaders on Monday, giving weight to his message that he can become the establishment favorite behind whom Republicans can unite. Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah and former Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole said they would back the U.S. senator from Florida for the partys nomination to run for president in the Nov. 8 election. Three Republican leaders from Nevada - U.S. Senator Dean Heller and U.S. Representatives Cresent Hardy and Mark Amodei - also announced their support for Rubio leading up the states caucuses on Tuesday. Im delighted to support @marcorubio because he is best choice to keep our country safe, Hutchinson posted on Twitter. Will you join me and help Marco win Arkansas? The Arkansas primary comes after Nevada in the state-by-state nominating contest on March 1. Twelve other states and American Samoa will also be holding primaries or caucuses on that date, known as Super Tuesday. The endorsements came as Rubio tries to seize on the exit of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush on Saturday to win the support of more mainstream members of their party. Bush dropped out after a poor showing in South Carolinas Republican primary. Hatch, who said he had initially supported Bush because he had more experience, called Rubio the more serious candidate compared with front-runner Donald Trump.  I feel he has the background to be able to really help turn this mess around, Hatch told reporters. Dole, a former U.S. senator from Kansas who lost to then-President Bill Clinton in 1996, said he switched his support to Rubio after Bush left the campaign trail because he was young, hard-working and a better candidate than rival Ohio Governor John Kasich. He wants to grow the party as opposed to (U.S. Senator Ted) Cruz, Dole said in an interview on ABCs Political Powerhouse podcast, referring to another Republican candidate. I dont know what he wants to grow.  (Reporting by Megan Cassella; Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell; Editing by Eric Walsh and Jonathan Oatis) This article was funded in part by SAP.

Activist Mckesson releases platform in Baltimore mayoral race,"(Reuters) - U.S. civil rights activist DeRay Mckesson released his full platform in the race for Baltimore mayor on Monday, proposals that include a $15-an-hour minimum wage and reforming the police department. Mckesson, who was instrumental in the growth of the Black Lives Matter movement, was the last candidate to file paperwork before the campaign deadline this month. Its a plan to change Baltimore, to make Baltimore a place that works for people, the 30-year-old activist said in announcing the plan on the Periscope video site. Baltimore, a majority African-American city, was torn by rioting after a black man, Freddie Gray, died from an injury in police custody in April. Six officers are facing trial in the case.     Mckesson, the son of two now-recovered drug addicts, had released police reform proposals this month that included banning arrest and citation quotas. He also backs ending civil asset forfeiture and rough rides and chokeholds by police.     The Teach for America alumnus and former school administrator called for free WiFi and broadband access for all residents. He backed reviving a proposed light-rail system scuttled by Maryland Governor Larry Hogan last year. Mckesson, who rose to prominence during the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police killing of an unarmed black teenager, said he would hire more inspectors to reduce sources of lead poisoning in children and would expand opportunities for artists in Baltimore. Mckesson has called for a city minimum wage of $15 an hour, which would be among the highest in the United States. He backs a public bank and more requirements for companies to hire locally. Mckesson also is in favor of expanded pre-kindergarten classes. He advocates changing state funding formulas so that tax breaks for developers do not cut into  school funding. His distinctive blue Patagonia vest has been seen everywhere from street demonstrations to the television show The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Twenty-nine candidates, including 13 Democrats, are running to replace Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, who is not seeking re-election. Primary voting for candidates will be held on April 26, with the actual mayoral vote being held on Nov. 8 alongside the presidential election.  Baltimore has not elected a Republican mayor in more than 50 years.  ",politicsNews,"February 22, 2016 ",1
Puerto Rico may issue delayed audited 2014 statements in April,"NEW YORK/SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Ricos much-delayed audited financial statements for 2014 are expected to be finished and issued by April, the U.S. territorys governor said in a letter to U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan on Monday. The delay in completing the statements is due to the complexities posed by our current financial crisis, Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said in the letter, emailed by a representative for the commonwealth.  However, he added that there may be additional issues that arise that require an adjustment to such timetable. A draft of the financials, which cited substantial doubt about the governments ability to continue as a going concern, was released last week, but did not include data from some agencies and has not been approved by auditors at KPMG.  The letter follows criticism from Republicans in Congress over the delay and a perceived lack of financial transparency from Puerto Rico. The islands leaders are hoping for legislative help from Congress in tackling its $70 billion in debt, 45 percent poverty rate and dwindling population as locals flock to the mainland United States. Ryan has called on the Republican-led House to propose legislation by the end of March aimed at addressing Puerto Rico.  In Mondays letter, Garcia Padilla gave a sense of what it might look like on the island if the government or its agencies failed to survive as going concerns  that is, became unable to meet financial obligations long term.  Entities subject to going concern assessments, Garcia Padilla wrote, include not only the government itself, but PREPA, the islands sole power utility; HTA, which operates the islands major roads; the Metropolitan Bus Authority, which transports thousands in the San Juan area; the Puerto Rico Medical Services Administration, the islands main hospital and trauma center; and PRIHA, which oversees Medicaid benefits for 1.6 million poor residents.  Garcia Padilla also stressed that the Government Development Bank, Puerto Ricos primary fiscal agent, may not be able to make debt payments in the last quarter of fiscal year 2016, and that the island may have to pass emergency legislation imposing a moratorium on GDB debt payments.

Senate banking panel Democrats seek action on Obama nominees,"(Reuters) - Senate Banking Committee Democrats on Monday asked the panels Republican chairman in a letter to clear the backlog of 16 nominations by President Barack Obama to posts related to financial oversight, national security and other areas. The committee, led by Republican Senator Richard Shelby, has failed to carry out one of its basic duties for more than a year, the 10 Democratic banking committee senators wrote in the Feb. 22 letter. It is the only Senate committee that did not act on any nominees last year, the Democrats wrote. Of the 16 nominations pending before the committee, four have been waiting for action for more than a year while others have been in limbo for more than nine months, the Democratic senators wrote. Shelby must stop obstructing the nominations, they wrote in a separate statement. All 10 Democrats on the committee signed the letter, including Senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Charles Schumer of New York.  A spokeswoman for Shelby did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shelby has said he is concerned that Obama has not nominated anyone as the U.S. Federal Reserves vice chair for supervision, a post created by the Dodd Frank financial reform law, but which has never been filled. We are aware of your concern that the Administration has not nominated anyone to serve as Vice Chair for Supervision at the Federal Reserve, but the response to one vacancy should not be the creation of 16 more, the Democratic banking committee senators wrote. It was unclear why President Obama has not appointed a nominee for the Fed post. A White House spokesperson was not immediately available for comment. The Senate Banking Committee backlog includes Lisa Fairfax and Hester Peirce, Obamas two nominees to the Securities and Exchange Commission and Adam Szubin, nominated as the Treasury Departments under secretary for terrorism and financial crimes.

Atlantic City mayor terms N.J. takeover plan 'fascist dictatorship',"ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (Reuters) - Atlantic Citys mayor has called a state plan to cede control of the fiscally distressed gambling hub a fascist dictatorship, a sharp reversal of his previous position on the proposed takeover. Details of the proposed legislation, released last week, would deny residents their civil rights by stripping municipal powers from locally elected officials, Mayor Don Guardian said on Monday, echoing previous concerns from community activists. The final piece of legislation that the state presented to us was far from a partnership, Guardian said, addressing hundreds of residents and city workers at an outdoor news conference next to City Hall. It was much worse. It was absolutely a fascist dictatorship. The plan calls for the state to appoint an official who would have the power to make unilateral decisions about canceling collective bargaining agreements, selling city-owned assets, entering contracts, terminating employees and vetoing city council minutes, Guardian said. The mayors comments marked a fiery change of tone from just one month ago, when Guardian stood next to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and state Senate President Steve Sweeney in support of the intervention. However, that was before the bills had taken shape. City officials previously threatened to file for a municipal bankruptcy. But such a move would likely not be approved by the state, which already oversees the citys budget. Nevertheless, officials raised the subject again on Monday, saying they might petition the state for a bankruptcy declaration if they cannot negotiate a settlement with the Borgata Casino Hotel & Spa.  Atlantic City owes the Borgata, its most profitable casino, at least $160 million of property tax appeals. The city missed a recent deadline to pay a $62.5 million portion of that, prompting the Borgata to skip its $7.5 million tax payment for the first quarter of 2016.  The parties are in 45-day court-ordered negotiations, Guardian said, but if there is no settlement the city could try to seek out bankruptcy. Atlantic City is on track to run out of money within two months. The latest legislative package would also include a less divisive bill that allows casinos to make fixed payments in lieu of taxes. That bill is aimed at stabilizing the citys property tax base, which has shrunk dramatically because of gambling competition from neighboring states. Four of the citys 12 casinos that shut in 2014 remain closed.    ",politicsNews,"February 22, 2016 ",1
Obama: China knows it cannot sustain export-driven growth model,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday said China recognized it could not sustain an export-driven growth model indefinitely but that it would take time to change. Speaking to state governors at the White House, Obama urged them to press the U.S. Congress to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact to boost U.S. exports in a region where China is the 800-pound gorilla. Obama said it was tempting for China to try to solve its short-term problems by dumping state-subsidized goods into the U.S. market but said his administration had made clear to China that would not work, Obama said. They recognize that they cant forever sustain an export-driven growth model, but its going to take some time and its tempting for them to solve short-term problems by just dumping a bunch of state-subsidized goods into the U.S. market, Obama said in response to a question raising concerns about Chinas exports of iron ore. Weve been very clear with them about the fact that thats not going to work, and were going to put in place tools to make sure it doesnt work, he said. Obama also said the United States had made clear China needed to have an orderly market-based currency system that did not advantage its companies over their U.S. counterparts. Right now, frankly, their intervention is to prop up their currency rather than to devalue it, because a lot of people have been nervous about the Chinese economy, he said. Obama told the governors he was cautiously optimistic that Congress ultimately will back the 12-nation TPP trade pact, which labor unions oppose because of what Obama called emotions about job losses from past trade deals. Our concern there was that China was the 800-pound gorilla. And if we allowed them to set trade rules out there, American businesses and American workers were going to be cut out, he said.  Obama said he would have to rely on votes from a set of strong pro-trade Democrats in Congress as well as Republicans. But Obama acknowledged that Republicans have also some concerns along the margins of the TPP, such as provisions affecting tobacco, and said the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election has roiled the debate in both parties. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, has said he has some problems with the TPP and does not think it should be pursued before the election. ",politicsNews,"February 22, 2016 ",1
U.S. to push for greater fiscal spending at G20: Treasury official,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will call on G20 countries this week to use fiscal policy in order to boost global demand, a senior U.S. Treasury official said on Monday. We will urge greater use of policy space, including fiscal space, to bolster global demand. That would lead to strengthened confidence and I would expect reduce volatility, the Treasury official said in a preview call with reporters ahead of a G20 meeting later this week in Shanghai, China. G20 finance ministers, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, and central bank governors will meet on Feb. 26-27, with sagging global growth, divergent monetary policies and currency devaluations set to dominate the agenda. While there, the United States will also urge all members to refrain from manipulating exchange rates for competitive purposes, in line with existing G20 commitments, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. I see those commitments as being a strong indication from G20 members that they will manage their currencies in ways that are globally consistent. I think that those commitments are very, very important, the official said. Lew has repeatedly called on China to more clearly communicate its currency policies and actions amid uncertainty over Beijings transition to a market-determined exchange rate. Recent Chinese efforts to improve its communications have been constructive, the official said. Chinas economic slowdown has also skittered financial markets as it seeks to rebalance its economy toward consumption-led growth.  The senior Treasury official said that supply-side reforms in China were crucial as it pivots to a stronger services sector, and praised the countrys ongoing efforts to reduce excess capacity. Lew is scheduled to travel to Beijing for two days immediately following the G20 gathering, where he will meet with senior Chinese government officials, Treasury said in a statement.  In those meetings he will urge China to follow through on its commitment to market-based economic reforms, the senior Treasury official said.  On Friday, IMF chief Christine Lagarde called on G20 officials to focus on global economic spillovers from their policy decisions. An increasing number of central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, have turned to negative interest rates over the past year in order to avoid deflation and promote economic growth.

Rubio picks outgoing Devon executive to oversee energy policy issues,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio has picked Devon Energy Corp co-founder Larry Nichols to help oversee his campaigns stance on energy issues, Rubio spokesman Jahan Wilcox said on Monday.     Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida, made the choice as his campaign efforts move toward the next round of primary voting states, including Nevada on Tuesday and then Oklahoma and Texas on March 1, Super Tuesday.      Nichols, who stepped down as Devons CEO in 2012 after more than 30 years but stayed on executive chairman, is set to fully retire this year from the Oklahoma-based oil producer. Like other powerful voices in the oil and gas industry, Nichols last year echoed calls to lift a 40-year-old federal ban on crude oil exports. Nichols is set to host a Feb. 26 fundraiser for Rubio in Oklahoma, a key U.S. energy state and home to significant horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and in December donated $50,000 to the super PAC supporting Rubio, according to Bloomberg News. Nichols, 73, is active in several industry groups, including Americas Natural Gas Alliance, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Business Industry Political Action Committee, and the American Petroleum Institute, according to Devons website. He also previously led the American Exploration & Production Council. Before his work in the energy sector, Nichols worked as a special assistant in the U.S. Department of Justice, the companys website said. Rubio is battling to be the Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election alongside front-runner and real estate tycoon Donald Trump and fellow U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a key oil state. Ohio Governor John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson are also seeking the Republican nomination.    (Reporting by Emily Stephenson) This article was funded in part by SAP.

Speaking to state governors at the White House, Obama said he would have to rely on votes from pro-trade Democrats and Republicans since labor leaders opposed the deal. Obama noted that Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan had largely been supportive of the pact.

Republican Marco Rubio winning Wall Street fundraising race,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican Marco Rubios presidential run has drawn more money from Wall Street donors than any other candidate, according to a Reuters review of campaign finance disclosures, shoring up his position as his partys establishment alternative to front-runner Donald Trump. The U.S. senator from Florida has received more than $4 million from the employees of banks and investment firms like Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) since launching his bid for the presidency last year, according to the analysis of individual donations totaling more than $200 each. (Click here for a graphic: reut.rs/1Q4ZisK) Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who dropped out of the race on Saturday after poor finishes in the early nominating contests of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, came in second in Wall Street donations, accumulating $2.45 million in contributions, while Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton took third place with $723,361, according to the review. The amounts include contributions to the candidates respective Super PACs, fundraising groups that are not directly connected to their campaigns but which spend on their behalf. More money could be on the way for Rubio as the Republican field narrows. Within minutes of Bush leaving the race, for example, some of his donors told Reuters they were preparing to throw their financial support behind Rubio. Wall Street donations, however, can hurt as well as help a candidate, especially with voters who blame bankers for the 2008 financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession. The idea of raising cash from Wall Street is a tricky one, said University of Iowa professor Tim Hagle.Even on the Republican side, theres a certain mistrust among the base for that sector.  But Hagle added that the financial support could help Rubio as he seeks to become the Republican partys anti-Trump candidate. The advantages of having the additional funding at this critical time seem to be worth the extra criticism that might come his way as a result, the professor said.U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who won Iowas caucuses but trailed Rubio slightly in South Carolinas primary, where he had hoped to win second place, has drawn just under $85,000 from Wall Street employees, according to the review. The support for Rubio was largely driven by donations to his allied Super PAC, Conservative Solutions. Billionaire investor Paul Singer endorsed Rubio in October and contributed $2.5 million to the Super PAC, according to the filings. In January, Rubio raised $9,792, the third-highest total for the month in the presidential field behind Clinton, with $51,000, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, with $26,000. Christie has also dropped out of the race. Bush raised just $5,513 from the sector in January. Democrat Bernie Sanders and Republican Donald Trump have received some of the smallest totals from Wall Street. Sanders, who has blamed the financial crisis on Wall Street and has promised to break up big banks, raised $26,650 from bank employees since launching his bid, a tiny fraction of the $96 million he has raised from all sources. Trump, a billionaire businessman who is self-funding his campaign, raised only $1,566 from employees of banks. Most of Trumps fundraising has come in the form of selling merchandise on his website.

"After Nevada, Sanders faces struggle to broaden appeal","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bernie Sanders high-flying Democratic presidential campaign fell back to Earth on Saturday in Nevada.  If the Vermont senator cannot quickly find a way to broaden his appeal to minorities and union members, last weeks 22-point rout of Clinton in New Hampshire could prove to be his campaign highlight. The race moves next week to South Carolina, where blacks make up more than half of the Democratic electorate, and on March 1 to a string of southern states with big blocs of African-Americans, who strongly support Clinton and have been slow to warm to Sanders. The rush of March contests in big, diverse states  Democrats in nearly two dozen states will vote between March 1 and March 15  could leave Sanders grasping for political life. This was a bad day for Sanders, said David Woodard, a political scientist at Clemson University in South Carolina. He needs to find a way to cut into Clintons base, and I dont think he is going to find it here. Although Clintons 5-point win was relatively narrow, it was enough to blunt Sanders momentum. Recent voter surveys had shown a tight race in Nevada, raising the prospect of another damaging setback for Clinton.      Entrance polls in Nevada showed Clinton trounced Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, by 3-to-1 among black voters, and also beat him in union households by 11 percentage points. The enthusiasm of younger and liberal voters who rallied around Sanders calls for reining in Wall Street and reducing income equality was not enough in Nevada to counter Clintons union and organizational clout, allowing her to reclaim front-runner status as the race shifts to more friendly turf. After the New Hampshire setback, Clintons campaign was banking that Sanders would be unable to breach a so-called firewall of Hispanic and African-American support for the former Secretary of State in southern and western states.  Nevadas result appeared to support that view. Hes running a strong campaign, but being close is overrated if you cant make the sale, said Mo Elleithee, a Clinton aide in her 2008 campaign and now the executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service. The Sanders campaign said it was heartened in Nevada by entrance polls showing he beat Clinton among Hispanics by about eight points. What we learned today is Hillary Clintons firewall with Latino voters is a myth, Arturo Carmona, deputy political director for Bernie 2016, said in a statement. But the Clinton campaign questioned those numbers, saying that at one point she had won 60 percent of the delegates in 22 Latino-majority precincts.  Clintons convincing showing in Nevada could reduce the chances of a late run by an independent candidate such as former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, who would likely scoop up moderate voters turned off by a socialist nominee. In a sense, Sanders was a victim in Nevada of his own success. His ability to close the gap on Clinton in Iowa and rout her in New Hampshire, nearly all-white states, raised expectations that he could ride to another upset in Nevada. Nevada put out the Bern, said Ken Tietjen, a Clinton supporter who stood outside her Las Vegas victory rally at Caesars Palace. Hillary has all the momentum going forward. But Sanders strong showings in the first three contests, along with his formidable fundraising, suggest staying power. That could help extend the Democratic race beyond the cluster of early March contests and into April and May, when a string of contests in whiter and more liberal states could help him. Sanders has money for the long haul, although Clinton had more on hand at the end of January. Federal election reports filed as the Nevada results were announced showed Sanders had raised $21.3 million in January and had $14.7 million on hand. In January, Hillary raised $13.2 million from individual donors and had $32.9 million on hand. Some black voters said on Saturday they did not see a reason to switch their loyalty away from Clinton, a fondness that dates back to her husband Bill Clintons presidency but which was strained by her bitter primary battle with Barack Obama in 2008. Asked who he was backing, Thomas Anderson, an African-American in Columbia, South Carolina, said on Saturday: Hillary, of course. Shes got more experience. She knows what the country needs, he said, adding Bernies a cool guy. Im down with Bernie too. Clintons embrace of Obamas presidential legacy, and her argument that Sanders would begin to unravel some of Obamas policies on healthcare and other issues, also has made an impression. Darien Gambrell, 23, said she heard Clinton planned to continue a number of Obamas policies. I think thats a good thing. I liked some of his ideas, even the ones that didnt seem to work at first, she said, adding she would not want a candidate who would reverse Obamas work.

Republican candidates offer stark contrast in visions as field thins,"CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - As the presidential field winnows after Donald Trumps commanding victory in South Carolinas nominating contest, U.S. Republican voters face a choice that grows starker by the day. Do they back the rage-infused, turn-back-the-clock tone of Trump, or perhaps his conservative, evangelical rival, Ted Cruz? Or do they favor the sunnier, more inclusive appeals of emerging establishment favorite Marco Rubio or Ohio Governor John Kasich. Not only will the answer decide the Republican nominee, it may well change what it means to be a Republican. The party is enduring a schism between those who want to work within the system and those want to tear it down. The GOP is broken [and] may not be salvageable, said Juleanna Glover, a Republican consultant in Washington who had supported Jeb Bush, who dropped out of the race on Saturday after a poor showing in South Carolina. Trumps support, she said, shows that one-third of the partys voters want out.  Bush, the former Florida governor, had been part of that camp of Republican establishment optimists. Ben Carson, the right-wing retired neurosurgeon, was never a factor in South Carolina and could be the next to exit. That leaves a Final Four, of sorts, as the campaign maintains a southern focus for a string of contests on March 1 that include Georgia, Texas, and Virginia. Trump and Cruz will be the favorites in many of them, with Rubio, a senator from Florida, and Kasich seen struggling until the primary schedule shifts to more hospitable regions, including their home states.  Rubio finished in a near tie for second in South Carolina with Cruz, rebounding strongly from his stumble in New Hampshire, where he finished fifth and was criticized for being overly scripted. He stands to benefit the most from Bushs departure as the perceived establishment standard-bearer. Kasich trailed well behind, managing fewer votes than Bush. Billionaire real estate developer Trump has racked up wins in two of the three early-voting states by channeling the disillusionment many Americans, especially the white working-class, feel with stagnant wages, globalization, the influence of corporate money in politics, and a gridlocked government. Cruz, a senator from Texas, has courted libertarian and religious voters who believe their values are under assault.  Both strike a tone of alarm, largely about the porous U.S. southwest border and the threat of Islamic State. And both often offer a paean to the past, asking voters to envision a time when the country appeared to be more prosperous and homogenous.  Some Republicans fear that the appeal of either candidate will simply be too narrow.  Its a dangerous direction for us to go in, said Chip Felkel, a Republican strategist in Greenville, South Carolina. Ill argue with anyone that a Cruz nominee or Trump nominee is someone who can expand this party and help us beat the Democrats. Alternatively, Rubio and Kasich bill themselves as healers of Americas fractured politics. On the stump, Rubio speaks of uniting the quarrelsome factions of the Republican Party, and has embraced diversity in a way that his competitors have not.  After the South Carolina results rolled in, Rubio, a Cuban-American, stood with South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, the daughter of Indian Sikh immigrants, and Tim Scott, an African-American Republican senator from the state.  This country is now ready for a new generation of conservatives to lead us into the 21st century, Rubio said.  Rubio has vowed to grow and unite the party and broaden its appeal among younger Americans. At a rally on Friday in North Charleston, Adam Mandel, 57, was approving of Rubio. He seems to be a little bit more willing not to go to extremes, Mandel said.  The contrast between Rubios events Friday and those of Trump and Cruz was vivid. Trump, just a day after getting into public spat with Pope Francis, told an apocryphal story about a general who executed Muslims using bullets dipped in pig blood. Cruzs rally featured Phil Robertson, star of the reality show Duck Dynasty who has condemned homosexuality as sinful.  But some Republican voters worry that Rubio, who, like Cruz, is a first-term senator, and Kasich, who has labeled himself the prince of light and hope, arent tough of enough to usher in the radical change they crave. I think Rubio is too easily influenced by the establishment, James Vinson, 70, a Cruz supporter from Charleston said. I think hell be their guy.

"Trump wins decisively in South Carolina, Clinton clinches Nevada","LAS VEGAS/COLUMBIA, S.C. (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump rolled to victory on Saturday in South Carolina in a contest that saw former Florida Governor Jeb Bush drop out, while Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton beat back a strong challenge from Bernie Sanders in Nevada. The victories by Trump, who is running as an anti-establishment outsider, and Clinton, a preeminent political insider, solidified their positions as the front-runners to win their parties respective nominations ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. The nights most prominent casualty, Bush suffered a distant fourth place finish in the Republican contest and announced he had suspended his campaign, ending his dream of becoming a third Bush president after his father and brother. The people of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina have spoken, and I really respect their decision, an emotional Bush said in Columbia. He finished far out of the running in each of the first three states. By winning both South Carolina and New Hampshire and holding leads in 13 states that hold Republican contests on March 1, Trump was arguably on track to win the nomination, an outcome that seemed astounding to contemplate when he entered the race last summer. Its going to be very difficult for him to be derailed at this point, said Hogan Gidley, who was a senior adviser to former Republican candidate Mike Huckabee.    The 69-year-old real estate billionaire and reality TV star was declared the winner in South Carolina about an hour after polls closed, and launched into a feisty victory speech.  Lets put this thing away, Trump told cheering supporters in Spartanburg. He denounced TV pundits for saying there could be enough anti-Trump votes to beat him when the race thins further. These geniuses, he said. They dont understand that as people drop out, Im going to get a lot of those votes also. You dont just add them together. Trump easily defeated Florida Senator Marco Rubio and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who were in a close fight for second place and the right to declare themselves the anti-Trump alternative. With 99 percent of South Carolina precincts reporting, Trump had 32.5 percent, followed by Rubio with 22.5 percent and Cruz with 22.3 percent.  Cruzs inability to distinguish himself from Rubio in the state was a blow to his campaign, which had invested heavily there to rally support among South Carolinas large population of evangelical voters. Trumps victory won him at least 44 of the states 50 delegates, bringing his delegate count to 61, compared to 11 for Cruz and 10 for Rubio, according to a tally by Real Clear Politics. Republicans need 1,237 delegates to win the party nomination. It was Trumps second victory in a row, an outcome that frightens establishment Republicans but thrills the throw-the-bums-out conservative base of the party that has long been fed up with Washington.         The bellicose New York billionaire had created some last-minute drama in South Carolina after Pope Francis said on Thursday his views on U.S. immigration were not Christian. Trump, who has also advocated a ban on Muslim immigrants to counter domestic terror threats, stirred fresh controversy on Friday when he told a crowd about a U.S. general who was said to have dipped bullets in pigs blood to kill Muslim prisoners a century ago. Former Secretary of State Clintons victory in the Nevada Democratic caucuses, meanwhile, could help calm worries among the Democratic establishment about the strength of her campaign. Her result denied Sanders the breakthrough win he had sought in a state with a heavy minority population, but his ability to close a one-time double-digit polling lead for Clinton suggests the Democratic nominating race will be long and hard fought. With 90 percent of precincts reporting, the former first lady was leading with 52.6 percent of the vote to Sanders 47.4 percent.  Clintons victory gave her fresh momentum as she heads into the next contest in South Carolina on Feb. 27, where polls show her with a double-digit lead largely as a result of heavy support from black voters. Some may have doubted us, but we never doubted each other, she told cheering supporters at a victory rally in Las Vegas. This is your campaign.     Sanders vowed to fight on and set his sights on the 11 states that vote on Super Tuesday, March 1. He predicted that when Democrats gather for their nominating convention in Philadelphia in July, We are going to see the results of one of the great political upsets in the history of the United States. The wind is at our backs, the Vermont senator said. We have the momentum. After routing Clinton in New Hampshire and finishing a strong second in Iowa, states with nearly all-white populations, Sanders had hoped to prove in Nevada that he could win over black and Hispanic voters and compete nationally as the race moves to states with more diverse populations. But entrance polling in Nevada showed he badly lost among black voters, by 76 percent to 22 percent, a bad omen for South Carolina and other southern states with big black populations. He did win among Hispanics by 53 percent to 45 percent. Clintons campaign has argued she would assert control of the Democratic race once it moved to more diverse states with black and Hispanic populations who have traditionally backed Clinton and have been slow to warm to Sanders.

Rubio sharpens attacks after latest Trump win in White House race,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Marco Rubio emerged from a razor-thin second-place finish in South Carolinas presidential primary on Sunday with the Republican field narrowed and his target clear: Donald Trump. Rubio squeaked by rival and U.S. Senate colleague Ted Cruz in a vote on Saturday that cemented the appeal of firebrand outsider Trump as well as the failure of a candidate from one of Americas political dynasties: Jeb Bush. The five remaining Republican candidates are now scrambling for voters in 12 states that hold nominating contests on March 1, also known as Super Tuesday, the next milestone on the road to the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Rubio, a first-term senator from Florida who himself has come under attack for lacking governing experience, turned that criticism on Trump, a billionaire businessman and former reality TV star who has never held elective office. Trump is long on rhetoric but short on specifics, Rubio said on CBSs Face the Nation, challenging the front-runner, who finished 10 points ahead in South Carolina, to provide them. If youre running to be president of the United States, you cant just tell people youre going to make America great again - I think you need to begin to explain exactly how youre going to do it, policy-wise, Rubio said, referring to the Trump campaign slogan Make America Great Again!  Rubio criticized Trump on healthcare policy and said he found his view of Russian leader Vladimir Putin troubling. I dont think he fundamentally understands exactly who Vladimir Putin is and or exactly what hes trying to do, Rubio said, quickly adding, This is not an attack or anything of that nature. In several television appearances, Rubio stressed his intention was not to go after Trump but to discuss issues. Rubio has reason to be skittish. A hallmark of Trumps campaign has been consistent and highly personal savaging of his political rivals - or anyone else he perceives has attacked him, including a milder rebuke of Pope Francis. His most notable target was Bush, whom he began characterizing early on as a low-energy loser. In television appearances on Sunday, Trump appeared uncharacteristically modest and took pains to lower expectations that his path to the Republican nomination was now clear. He responded to Rubios criticism without attacking Rubio himself, saying on CBS that he had great knowledge of foreign policy. Cruz, who had expected his appeal to conservative and evangelical voters to give him an edge in South Carolina, said he was the only candidate who has beaten and could beat Trump. Cruz told NBCs Meet the Press he expects conservatives to rally behind him in his home state of Texas and other contests on Super Tuesday, which include Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas and Oklahoma. The next Republican contest is on Tuesday in Nevada, where Trump is the runaway favorite. Cruz said Trump has embraced liberal ideas, including abortion rights and requiring healthcare coverage, as well as liberal politicians, including Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton. Republicans want a real conservative, Cruz said on ABCs This Week.  Cruz and Rubio tried to draw voters away from Trump, a political outsider who has bucked the Republican Party establishment and caught its leaders off guard. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus struggled to explain Trumps appeal when asked on ABCs This Week, if the South Carolina result was a rebuke to the party. No, I dont think so, Preibus replied, saying he believed voters are sick and tired of politics in general. But who the nominee is going to be is not my choice and - and obviously, uh, were going to support whoever that is. Trump on Sunday looked to just that possibility. He said he believed Clinton, who is competing with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, would be the eventual Democratic nominee and said he was the only Republican who could win states like New York and Michigan, which lean Democratic. I will win states that arent in play. I will win states that the Republicans dont even think of, he said on CNNs State of the Union. Those sweeping predictions aside, Trump tried to contain expectations in several television appearances. He called both Rubio and Cruz talented men who could conceivably beat him for the nomination, along with the remaining Republican candidates: Ohio Governor John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. He then quipped, You know, crazy things happen in the world of politics.

Many U.S. Catholics unfazed by pope's clash with Trump,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Catholics voiced support for Pope Francis on Sunday after he criticized Donald Trumps immigration stance as not Christian, but many interviewed by Reuters said the controversy would not necessarily sour them on the Republican presidential contender. The pontiff injected himself into the U.S. campaign during a conversation with reporters on his flight home from Mexico on Thursday. In his comments, Francis disparaged Trumps vow to build a wall along the southern U.S. border to keep out illegal immigrants. A sampling of opinion from people before and after Sunday Mass suggested that many Catholics saw the popes comments as well-intentioned and grounded in a moral worldview. Many said Francis, who has become a champion of inclusion in his three-year tenure as head of the Roman Catholic Church, was right to insist on the humane treatment of all immigrants.  Even so, most of those interviewed in Boston and New York would not rule out voting for Trump based on what Francis said. About 21 percent of the U.S. population identifies as Catholic. I agree with the pope as far as being a true Christian, you accept everybody, said Paul Nappi, 65, outside Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Brooklyn, New York. I happen to like Trump but I dont know if hes literally about building walls or thats just a figure of speech. Many churchgoers said the media unfairly whipped up the controversy to goad the pope and Trump into a fight days before Saturdays South Carolina Republican primary. Trumps victory there made the billionaire real estate mogul the clear front-runner for his partys nomination for the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. Its very treacherous for the media to ask those questions to the pope because they were questions inspired by the media itself, said Catalina Carmona, 31, a lawyer visiting New York from Colombia. He was put in a difficult situation and he said what a leader in his position would be able to say. Francis never directly criticized Trump or mentioned him by name when he told reporters: A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. Carol Menkiti, 76, of Somerville, Massachusetts, said of the popes remarks: I felt he was using an analogy thats often used. I love the pope.  I dont think he comments on politics, but he talks about the human condition, she said after attending Mass at St. Pauls Church in Cambridge, Massachusetts. A spokesman for Francis sought on Friday to tone down the controversy, insisting the pontiff was not making a personal attack on Trump or any statement about the U.S. election. After initially saying it was disgraceful for the pope to judge anothers faith in God, the blunt-spoken Trump said Francis was a nice man who was probably misinterpreted by the media. But from the pulpit of St. Pauls, the Rev. James Flavin did not shy away from the issue. In his Sunday sermon, he linked the popes remarks about walls to many of the social justice themes he has sounded since his papacy began in March 2013. The pope denounced a world divided by walls, Flavin said. Hes challenging us to change the world through our imitation of Christ. How much the popes views will influence U.S. Catholics in the voting booth is an open question, but parishioners suggested a muted impact at best. While most of those interviewed said they respected the popes moral authority, Joe Ruggiero, 70, thought Francis sometimes gets a little carried away with what he characterized as a basically socialist point of view. Catholics believe the pope is infallible in issues of faith, not issues of politics, Ruggiero said outside the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston. Nappi said the popes influence over Catholics would not necessarily be the sole determining factor in how Catholics vote.  I think anytime the pope says something, of course itll have an affect on Catholic voters, he said. Me personally, I like to weigh all the issues before I make a definitive opinion one way or another.

How Egypt's changing culture led one emigre to Trump," (In this February 20 story, corrects in second paragraph that Ibrahim came to the U.S. in 1981, corrects the reason for Ibrahims protest in paragraph 9.) By Emily Flitter MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (Reuters) - Elhamy Ibrahim, 62, is a Muslim who does not like very many other Muslims these days, but loves Donald Trump. The Egyptian-born businessman who came to the United States in 1981 and became a citizen two decades later said in an interview on Friday that he was alarmed by changes in Egypt, where, in his view, high unemployment and poverty have driven many young Egyptians to religious extremism. He strongly backs Trumps proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. until authorities can determine if they pose a threat, even though such a ban could bring hassles for him if he traveled abroad. That is one reason why Ibrahim, who says he does not attend a mosque regularly, approached the real estate mogul after a rally in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and called out Im a Muslim and I love you!  NBC News published a video of the exchange, which took place the evening before Saturdays Republican primary in South Carolina. Ibrahim proudly posted the video to his Facebook page. Trump has stirred outrage not just in the U.S. but around the world for comments that his critics say are anti-Muslim. But Trumps fans, including Ibrahim, say Trumps rhetoric, rather than being insensitive and exclusionary, addresses their fears of the violence they see occurring halfway across the globe. If he stopped me coming into the U.S., Id say fine, Ibrahim said. If he said he wanted a loyalty test, Id be the first to sign it. SELF-IMPOSED EXILE  As a university student, Ibrahim was jailed twice by the security services of the late President Anwar Sadat, then drafted to fight in Egypts 1973 war against Israel, where he was wounded by an explosion that left him blind in one eye.  He said Egyptian security officials ripped his toenails out with pliers because he had protested over Sadat not going to war with Israel. After finishing his degree, he went to Yemen and became friends with the U.S. Consul General in Sanaa, who persuaded him to come to the United States. He lived first in New York, then Baltimore, where he began buying real estate, and eventually moved to Myrtle Beach. Despite the torture he suffered, Ibrahim is comfortable with Trumps call to bring back waterboarding and much worse when interrogating terror suspects. Torture is being used all over the world, today, tomorrow and yesterday, Ibrahim said. At least hes saying it in public. His favorite thing about Trump is his business background. Hell bring America back - I want to see America that I used to know, not the one that (President Barack) Obama and (former President) George W. Bush destroyed. He also wants a president who sees Muslims the way he does. His mother and sister, who grew up wearing high heels and mid-length skirts, began to wear head scarves in the early 1990s to avoid harassment on the streets of Cairo. Egypt became a more conservative place. The media there, they make America seem evil, he said. They destroy the spirit of the younger generation, they make them stuck in religion like a bunch of sheep in a flock.

Wealthy donors drawn to Rubio White House bid after Bush drops out,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Within minutes of Jeb Bush dropping out of the presidential race Saturday night, some of his donors were preparing to throw their financial support behind Marco Rubio, who has emerged as the strongest candidate among the establishment wing of the party. Jebs network is already naturally migrating to Marco, said Gaylord Hughey, a top Bush fundraiser from Texas, echoing what four other top donors told Reuters. Its the clear path. Its a stampede, added another donor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wanted to give Bush some time after dropping out before he went public with his support of Rubio, the U.S. senator from Florida. Three other Bush donors, who declined to be named, also said they now planned to support Rubio.   Although he has failed to win any of the first three nominating contests, Rubio is considered by many political strategists as the best positioned to challenge frontrunner Donald Trump, a billionaire political outsider, and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who has campaigned on an anti-Washington message. The likelihood that some of Bushs deep-pocketed donors will back Rubio comes at an opportune time for his candidacy, as he heads into a series of contests in March that will be crucial for building momentum. Brian Ballard, who raised money for Bush last year but switched allegiances last summer to Rubio, said: Its flooding tonight. Ninety-five percent of Jebs money is going to end up with Marco.  Rubio had only $5 million in cash on hand at the end of January, federal campaign finance reports released Saturday night show, a slim buffer by modern campaign standards.  Conservative Solutions, a political spending group that supports his campaign, had $5.6 million on hand at the end of January, but spent an additional $9.3 million on advertising in the first 19 days of February.  By contrast, Right to Rise, Bushs political spending group,  had $24.5 million on hand at the end of January but spent $6.6 million of that in February on ads. And his network of donors have proven their financial might, helping Bush at one point to amass a war chest of $150 million. Even before Bush dropped out, some donors privately complained about the missteps of the campaign, expressing concern about the strength of Trumps candidacy and Bushs lackluster debate performances.  In January, a dozen top Bush donors interviewed by Reuters said they were angry that Bush was using their money to lob attack ads at Rubio, damaging the candidate they thought had the best chance to win.  They also said they had privately signaled to the Rubio campaign that they would support him once Bush dropped out. But they wouldnt go public at the time because they feared displeasing the Bush dynasty.       In addition to the Bush money, Rubio is expected to reap the support of the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers and their donor network, which is expected to spend $400 million in the presidential race, according to several network donors and Koch political organization officials.  The Koch brothers are also in the midst of planning efforts to undercut Trumps candidacy, network officials and members said at a recent private retreat in California. Their focus group research has shown that when voters learn more about how Trumps past business behavior has hurt ordinary people, they sour on him, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Unforced errors and miscalculations end Bush's White House hopes,"CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Before Donald Trumps put-downs and the stumbles in presidential debates, and before the profound frustration of voters became so unmistakably apparent, Jeb Bush appeared to be best positioned to win back the White House for Republicans in 2016. He amassed a $150 million war chest in 2015, surrounded himself with some of the best minds in the party, had a famous last name and attracted the support of the party establishment. And yet, after a dismal finish in South Carolina, Bush  dropped out of the race on Saturday with an emotional speech. I firmly believe the American people must entrust this office to someone who understands that whoever holds it is the servant, not the master, someone who will commit to that service with honor and decency, he said.  How Bush found himself out of the race after just the third nominating contest of 2016 is a cautionary tale of political miscalculation and strategic errors, according to interviews with a dozen Republican operatives, many with close ties to the Bush campaign and others who worked for the last two Republican presidential nominees, conducted during the last days of his campaign. From the start, they said, Bush appeared to misjudge the mood of the Republican base. In December 2014, for instance, Bush gathered his senior aides and a small group of national political operatives for a meeting in Miami to talk about his coming candidacy. A survey to gauge the national mood of the party was dismissed by Bush and his aides as unnecessary. Such polling, a participant said, would have made clear to Bush the rebellious sentiment of the conservative base of the party.  They missed the boat, the participant said. The polling may have also helped the campaign spot the threat of Trump, a billionaire and political outsider who tapped into that anti-establishment anger and stormed to the top of the polls. The Bush campaign disputed the charge as inaccurate. He has shared the frustration of voters from the outset and he has not strayed from that, said spokeswoman Kristy Campbell. He has presented a hopeful, optimistic message that is based on the belief that he has the leadership skills to get the job done. Viewing Trump as a summer fad who would fade given his outrageous comments, the campaign was slow to respond to the billionaire when he first blasted Bush last August as low-energy. Bush maintained his above-the-fray strategy and focused on his policy proposals instead of mixing it up with Trump. Trump relentlessly and bluntly attacked Bush in speeches and on Twitter, portraying him as tired, weak and out of touch with the party. Trump has mentioned Bush on Twitter hundreds of times, far more than any other Republican candidate.   There was a decision made that he was not a serious person and would fade away, said one Republican strategist close to the Bush camp, who asked to remain anonymous. You dont want to dignify somebody who wasnt a serious candidate. It wasnt just Jeb. Nobody thought he was.  When the low energy attacks on Bush started to take hold and his poll numbers began dropping, he went out of his way to insist he had plenty of energy to be president, talking of working 16-hour days, putting in feistier appearances on the stump and hitting back at Trump hard.   Behind the scenes, though, donors said they fretted that too much time had gone by before he took the problem seriously.  Some confidants of the former Florida governor seethed for weeks at Trumps taunts and urged the campaign to shift to a more aggressive posture.  They made a horrendous miscalculation in not understanding the intent of the low-energy attack, which was designed to emasculate Bush, to make him look weak, said Steve Schmidt, who was campaign manager to 2008 Republican nominee John McCain.  Defining him as weak denied him the ability to make the argument that by resume, competence and experience he was the most fit to command, said Schmidt.  When Bush launched his campaign in June, he was the clear frontrunner among Republicans, polling at nearly 18 percent in a crowded field. Roughly six weeks later Trump had taken a commanding lead with 26 percent and Bush had dropped to around 12 percent, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Today Trump stands at 38 percent.  But Trump was hardly Bushs only obstacle. Perhaps his biggest misstep was one of his own making, when he spent days trying to explain whether he would have launched the Iraq war begun by his brother, former President George W. Bush.  Even George W. Bush has admitted mistakes were made in the 2003 conflict. But for a week last May, Jeb Bush was flummoxed by the question. The trouble began when he told Fox News that I would have launched the invasion even knowing what is now known - that Iraq did not possess weapons of mass destruction. While Bush said he did not understand the question, his response began days of controversy that fed a narrative pushed by Democrats that he was little different from his brother when it came to Iraq.  Some of Bushs foreign policy advisers were surprised that Bush did not have an answer prepared for the inevitable question.  There was a disagreement among his advisers on how best to respond, a genuine amount of confusion and upsetness about the whole thing, said one outside adviser to the campaign, who asked to be anonymous.  Not wanting to be disloyal to his brother, Bush spent days trying to articulate a position until he finally disavowed the statement and declared he would not have ordered the war.  The fact that we went through this anguished process of several days and several kinds of answers was quite astonishing, the adviser said.  Finally, George W. Bush told his brother he did not need to defend decisions made back in 2003.  Jeb Bush had an on-again, off-again strategy to embrace the family name, but finally took full advantage of his family in New Hampshire and especially in South Carolina, where the Bush family name remains a valuable brand. For the first time in the campaign former President George W. Bush hit the campaign trail in South Carolina for his brother, addressing thousands of Republicans at a rally.  I know campaigns are stressful and taxing, he said. But they should be.Because the job of the president is much harder than the campaign. The challenges of the campaign were driven home two days later when Jeb Bush learned that South Carolinas governor, Nikki Haley, would endorse Rubio.  It was a double blow for Bush: not only did he fail to secure the backing of a popular governor, it went instead to Rubio, his one-time political protg who has been the target of stinging attacks from Bush. His allied Super PAC, Right to Rise USA, spent at least $12.5 million on advertising opposing Rubio, according to Federal Election Commission data. Bush learned about the endorsement at a town hall meeting in Summerville, South Carolina, where some members of the audience gave him advice on how to run his campaign. He summed up the news briskly. Disappointed, he said. By Saturday night, less than two hours after the polls had closed, Bush had called it quits.

Republican Jeb Bush ends 2016 presidential campaign,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush said on Saturday he was suspending his campaign after a disappointing finish in the South Carolina primary.  Bush, who also fared poorly in earlier contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, said the race had been hard fought but that voters of those three states had spoken. In what appeared to be a jab at Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, whom Bush has accused of lacking ideas, the former Florida Governor said, ideas matter, policy matters.  Bush, the son of former President George H.W. Bush and brother to former President George W. Bush, entered the 2016 campaign as the favorite, but was unable to convert a sizable fundraising advantage into success at the polls. ",politicsNews,"February 21, 2016 ",1
Illinois judge to decide jurisdiction over Cruz eligibility complaint,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - An Illinois judge on Friday said she would decide next month whether she had jurisdiction over a voters complaint that Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz should not be on the states primary ballot because he was born in Canada. Lawrence Joyce, a lawyer and pharmacist, filed a complaint in January with the Illinois State Board of Elections saying that under the U.S. Constitution, the Texas senator cannot run for president since he is not a natural born citizen. Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta of a Cuban father and an American mother. The Board rejected Joyces complaint - saying Cruz became a natural-born citizen at the moment of his birth because of his mothers citizenship - so he petitioned the Cook County Circuit Court to review that decision. Circuit Court Judge Maureen Ward Kirby said she was not sure she had jurisdiction, and set a March 1 hearing for arguments on whether to dismiss the complaint. The complaint comes in the wake of repeated attacks on Cruz about his eligibility by New York businessman and presidential rival Donald Trump. Children born abroad to American citizens can immediately be registered as U.S. citizens through a consular report of birth abroad, but Joyce said that process is a form of naturalization. A Reuters/Ipsos poll in January found that one quarter of Republicans did not think Cruz was qualified to be president because of his birthplace.  Cruz and Trump are locked in a battle to win the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election. Cruz won the first nominating contest in Iowa while Trump prevailed in New Hampshire. A potential nightmare scenario may be developing if Ted Cruz becomes the nominee and is then forced to resign the nomination, Joyce told reporters. He backs Republican candidate Ben Carson but said no candidate was involved in his lawsuit. Voters in New York and in Alabama have also filed legal challenges to Cruzs eligibility. It is widely assumed and believed that no court is going to invalidate a presidential candidate on this issue, said Gerald Rosenberg, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School. Lawyers for both Cruz and the Illinois State Board of Elections said they would present motions to dismiss the case based on jurisdiction and because they said Lawrence did not properly serve notice of his complaint. The Illinois primary is March 15 but early voting has already begun. ",politicsNews,"February 19, 2016 ",1
"Vatican to Trump: It's not 'personal,' it's religion","MYRTLE BEACH, South Carolina (Reuters) - The Vatican on Friday tried to tamp down a firestorm ignited by Pope Francis comments assailing Donald Trumps views on U.S. immigration as not Christian, assuring the Republican presidential front-runner that it was not a personal attack or attempt to influence the U.S. campaign. Francis told reporters during a conversation on his flight home from Mexico on Thursday, A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. Trump has said if elected president, he would build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border to keep immigrants from illegally entering the United States.  Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi told Vatican Radio the popes comments, in response to a reporters question on Trump, were an affirmation of his longstanding belief that migrants should be helped and not shut out. He said the pope believed people should build bridges, not walls. In no way was this a personal attack, nor an indication of how to vote, Lombardi said.  Trump, who leads Republican candidates in opinion polls, lashed out on Thursday, dismissing the popes remarks as disgraceful for questioning his faith. If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS (Islamic State), which as everyone knows is ISIS ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president, Trump said. Later, during a television appearance, he rowed back, calling Francis a wonderful guy. The extraordinary exchange between the billionaire real estate developer and leader of the worlds 1.25 billion Roman Catholics, which occurred days before Saturdays Republican nominating contest in South Carolina, was headline news around the world. On Friday, New Yorks Daily News gave it the front page. Against a backdrop of an image of Trump, a headline blared: Anti Christ! The New York Post ran a front page photo of Trump and the pope wearing boxing gloves with the headline: Trump & pope: Bible belters.      It was unclear what, if any, effect the tussle might have on the vote in South Carolina, a conservative state that is home to many evangelical Protestant Christians. Patrick Hornbeck, chairman of the department of theology at Fordham University in New York, said on Thursday that Francis words were not surprising given the poverty he had just seen in Mexico. There is very little common ground between Pope Francis and Donald Trump, Hornbeck said. He predicted the popes words on electoral politics would have little effect on any U.S. Catholics who liked Trump as a candidate. At a CNN town hall in Columbia, South Carolina, on Thursday night, Trump said he had a lot of respect for Francis but that the pope had been influenced by hearing only Mexicos side of the border issue. The popes statement also had been exaggerated by the media, he said. I think he said something much softer than it was originally reported by the media, Trump said.  Earlier on Thursday, Thomas Groome, director of the Boston College Center on the Church in the 21st Century, said Francis comments were entirely in keeping with his focus on mercy. The pope is commissioned to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Thats his job, Groome said. So when he was asked a direct question, he gave Trump the benefit of the doubt, he said we have to be sure he said this, but if he said this, it is not Christian.

"At Scalia funeral, led by son, U.S. court battle in recess","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalias memorial service on Saturday provided a brief respite for official Washington from the fierce battle over his succession, with political and legal leaders and many others in attendance. At the blue-domed Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the nations largest Catholic church, dozens of priests took part in the funeral mass, led by one of the justices nine children, Reverend Paul Scalia. More than 3,000 people looked on, including other family members, the courts remaining eight justices, lawmakers, Vice President Joseph Biden and former Vice President Dick Cheney. God blessed Dad with a deep Catholic faith, the younger Scalia told the gathering inside the cathedral. He loved the clarity and coherence of the churchs teachings. He fondly remembered an outburst one day after his father realized he was waiting for confession at church in a line that would have led him to his son. The justice jumped out of the line. Like heck if Im confessing to you, the father said later to the son, who remarked: The feeling was mutual. A staunch conservative and the courts longest-serving member, Justice Scalia died last Saturday at age 79 at a Texas hunting resort, sparking a political struggle that promises to reshape the 2016 election campaigns. Presidential candidate Ted Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas, was among those at the service. Like other Republicans, he has said that President Barack Obama, a Democrat, should not choose Scalias replacement. Rather, Republicans are saying no one should be named until after the presidential election in November, hoping that one of their own will be elected and get to choose the next justice.  Under law, the U.S. president is responsible for nominating Supreme Court justices to their lifetime appointments, subject to Senate review and confirmation. Appointing a justice to the court is one of the biggest decisions a U.S. president can make. Obama has vowed to select a successor to Scalia. If he does so, Senate Republicans have threatened to block any nominee put forward by Obama, a stance likely to become an issue in the presidential race and in election year contests for seats in the Senate and the House of Representatives. According to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, a majority of Americans believe it should be up to Obama to nominate the next  justice, with opinion divided along ideological party lines. This year the normally nine-justice court is set to decide its first major abortion case in nearly a decade, as well as cases on voting rights, affirmative action and immigration. The new justices politics could tilt the courts balance. After Scalias death, it has four conservative and four liberal members. Appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1986, Scalia became known as a brilliant jurist in an era of conservative court dominance. He opposed abortion and same-sex marriage and supported the death penalty and gun rights. ",politicsNews,"February 20, 2016 ",1
"Republican Trump backed Iraq war in 2002 interview, says views changed","(Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, who frequently touts his opposition to the Iraq war, appeared to support the idea in a newly unearthed 2002 interview, but said on Thursday he became an opponent by the time the invasion occurred. In the interview before the war began, which was republished by Buzzfeed on Thursday, radio personality Howard Stern asked Trump if he supported invading Iraq. Yeah I guess so, Trump said, according to the audio clip. During a town hall event in South Carolina on Thursday, Trump said the interview was not relevant because his views changed before the invasion. By the time the war started, I was against it, and shortly after, I was really against it, he said.    The billionaire businessman and former reality TV star, who leads the field seeking the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama, has cited his opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq as evidence of his foreign policy credentials. But his criticism of former Republican President George W. Bushs actions has aggravated some in his party, including in South Carolina, which holds its Republican primary on Saturday. Trumps comments on Thursday came after a participant at the CNN event said he was stung when the real estate mogul in a recent Republican debate accused Bush of lying about the reasons to go to war. He was referring to allegations, later proven false, that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction.  Trump walked back that criticism, saying the reasons for going to war were unclear. But he said the invasion was not justified and contributed to the destabilization of the Middle East. Going into Iraq, it may have been the worst decision anybody has made, any president has made, in the history of this country. Thats how bad it is, Trump said.

Key South Carolina Democrat Clyburn endorses Clinton for president,"(Reuters) - U.S. Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina backed Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination on Friday, giving her campaign a vital boost from the states most influential black politician ahead of next weeks primary. Clyburns endorsement comes as Clinton battles rival Bernie Sanders for the support of blacks in the South Carolina contest on Feb. 27, when more than half of the voters are likely to be black. Polls show Clinton with a solid double-digit lead in South Carolina, fueled by strong African-American support. Clyburns backing could help solidify that lead. Campaigns are and should be about the future, and I believe that the future of the Democratic Party and the United States of America will be best served with the experience and know-how of Hillary Clinton as our 45th president, Clyburn said at a news conference in South Carolina. Clyburn, the No. 3 ranked Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives and the only Democrat in Congress from South Carolina, stayed neutral in the bitter 2008 race between Clinton and Barack Obama. But he said he decided to get involved this time because Clinton was well positioned to tackle many of the challenges facing minorities and the country. Hillary Clinton is a fighter, and thats what we need for our next president, Clyburn said. Clinton and Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, have been courting support from black civil rights leaders and voters as the Democratic race has moved on from mostly white Iowa, where Clinton narrowly won, and New Hampshire, where Sanders routed Clinton.

"Oil industry bet big on Jeb Bush for president, Reuters review shows. Now what?","(Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas executives bet big on 2016 Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush - they donated more to his White House run than to all of his rivals combined, according to a Reuters review of campaign disclosures. But that was last year. Now Bush faces what party strategists and donors view as a make or break moment on Saturday in South Carolinas Republican primary, or early nominating contest. Polls show him trailing in the single digits. If he fails to do well, there will be pressure on him to quit, strategists say, and the oil money will be looking for a new home. The main beneficiaries in the Republican race would likely be Ted Cruz, a U.S. Senator from Texas, and Marco Rubio, a U.S. Senator from Florida. After Bush, the two candidates received the most contributions from the oil and gas industry, according to the Reuters review. When Bush entered the White House race last year, the petroleum sector saw him as their natural choice: he was the son and brother of former presidents and he came from a West Texas family with historically close ties to the oil industry. Bush is part of a family that is a friendly face to the oil industry, said Sarah Emerson, director of Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Boston. He drew more than $2 million from the chief executive officers of companies like Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Halliburton (HAL.N), Kinder Morgan (KMI.N), and Chief Oil & Gas in 2015, making up about 56 percent of all the industrys contributions to the race so far, according to the review. The review covered contributions from 75 oil and gas companies, their employees, and their political action committees to presidential candidates campaigns and allied Super PACs. When counting donations only to Republican candidates campaigns, employees favored Cruz among the Republicans, with Bush in second place and Rubio in third. (Click here for a graphic on oil and gas money in the U.S. presidential race: tmsnrt.rs/24cW28e ) Several of Bushs biggest oil CEO donors have links to his family. Richard Kinder of Kinder Morgan, for example, campaigned for George H.W. Bushs run for the White House in 1992, and for George W. Bushs run in 2004. Halliburtons CEO, David Lesar, meanwhile, succeeded Dick Cheney after George W. Bush nominated him vice president in 2000. Some of those people may be thinking support can get them a place in Bush-world, said one Washington D.C.-based oil industry lobbyist, who asked not to be named. The question is, where does that money go if Bush bleeds out? Bush is now running in fifth place among seven Republicans in a national Reuters/Ipsos poll. He has just 8 percent support leading into Saturdays primary, compared with front-runner Donald Trumps 40 percent. Cruz and Rubio came second and third in the poll with 17 percent and 11 percent, respectively. Donations directly from oil companies and their political action committees or PACs have been practically nil  suggesting that millions of dollars remain on the sidelines of the race that could be deployed once the field of candidates narrows. This years election is particularly important to oil and gas executives because of a steep slump in energy prices that has slashed profits and worries that another Democratic president could strengthen curbs on drilling and carbon emissions introduced by President Barack Obama. There is a pronounced partisan agenda on energy, said Robert McNally, founder and president of the Washington-based global energy consultancy The Rapidan Group, explaining the two parties have moved farther apart on energy policy. Theres no middle of the road anymore, he said. As a group, oil and gas company CEOs have doled out nearly $3.2 million in support of presidential candidates so far  more than three times more than all oil company employees did in the equivalent period of the 2012 race. One million dollars of that went to Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who dropped out in September. The CEOs are not alone in giving big. Some families that made their cash in the oil industry have also been major donors,  like the Wilks brothers of Texas, who have given Cruzs Super PAC $15 million. The biggest oil company CEO donations to current candidates have come from the heads of Kinder Morgan and Chief Oil and Gas, at more than $1 million each to Bushs campaign and his allied Right To Rise USA Super PAC, according to the filings to the Federal Election Commission.  Rubio, meanwhile, took some $38,000 from chief executives at Devon Energy (DVN.N), AGL (AGL.AX), and Atmos (ATO.N). Cruz received no money from energy company CEOs. Individual donations from oil company employees who were not CEOs appeared to favor Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton, who took in more than $110,000. Cruz was next with nearly $105,000.

Pressure grows on Hillary Clinton to release Goldman Sachs speeches,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton continued to resist calls to release her transcripts of paid speeches she gave to Goldman Sachs and other banks, saying she would hold onto them until Bernie Sanders and other rivals for the U.S. presidency released theirs. Sanders, her populist rival for the Democratic presidential nomination who has surged in polls with his furious rebukes of Wall Street and its role in the 2008 recession, said on Friday he had none to release because he does not give paid speeches to banks.  Clintons reluctance to reveal what she privately told banks and other organizations has become an increasingly heated issue ahead of the election this November as she fights suggestions by Sanders and others from their partys more liberal wing that she is too cozy with the U.S. financial industry. I am happy to release anything I have whenever everybody else does the same, because everybody in this race, including Senator Sanders, has given speeches to private groups, she said on Thursday night in a televised town hall event with voters in Nevada. Nevada is the third state to vote for the Democratic Partys nominee in caucuses to be held on Saturday.  Clinton has earned more than $20 million for 92 paid speeches since leaving her job as U.S. secretary of state in 2013, according to records disclosed by her campaign, including $675,000 for three closed-door speeches to New York-based investment bank Goldman Sachs. Her husband, Bill Clinton, has earned even more since he stepped down as president in 2001. She says this income has no influence on her policies and that she would increase Wall Street regulation. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, last gave a paid speech in 2004, according to his Senate financial disclosures, when he spoke about social activism at the California Institute of Technology in an event that was open to the public. He earned $2,000, according to his disclosures. On Friday, Sanders spokesman said the senator accepts Clintons challenge. He will release all of the transcripts of all of his Wall Street speeches, Michael Briggs said in a statement. Thats easy. The fact is, there werent any.  Briggs said he hoped this was sufficient for Clinton to release her transcripts. Clintons standard speakers contract stipulated that the speechs host make a transcript that would then remain in Clintons control. Spokesmen for Clinton and Goldman Sachs did not respond to questions.  It remained unclear if Clintons Republican rivals would meet her demands.

"Republican White House hopefuls Rubio, Bush battle it out in South Carolina","CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush are locked in a bare-knuckled fight for third place in a South Carolina primary vote on Saturday, afraid that anything less could blunt their White House hopes. With front-runner Donald Trump fighting to hold off U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and win his second straight early nominating contest, Rubio and Bush are battling to become the main anti-Trump alternative from among establishment Republicans seeking the partys nomination for the Nov. 8 election. An NBC News-Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Friday showed Trump in the lead with support from 28 percent of likely Republican primary voters, followed by Cruz at 23 percent. Rubio led Bush narrowly, 15 percent to 13 percent. The Bush-Rubio competition is layered with home-state drama: Bush, 63, is the elder statesman of Florida politics having served as governor. Rubio, 44, is the upstart understudy, a first-term U.S. senator who served in Floridas legislature. Rubio supporters were offended by the millions of dollars in attack ads spent by Bushs Super PAC, Right to Rise, believing that the money would have been better spent attacking Trump rather than trying to undermine a like-minded Republican. People are going to do whatever they think they need to do to win. But its notable they spent far more money attacking Marco than they have the front-runner Donald Trump, said Rubio spokesman Alex Conant. The Bush team dismissed the complaints. I dont think theres anything personal about it from Jebs side, said Jim Dyke, Bushs campaign chief in South Carolina. Jeb for good reason feels like hes much more qualified to be president of the United States. Thats what this is all about. Bush has a key backer in South Carolinas Republican U.S. senator, Lindsey Graham, but Rubio upped the ante by winning the support of popular Governor Nikki Haley. Her endorsement gave Rubio momentum at just the right time and the two have campaigned together around the state. Rubio is treading carefully around whether Bush should exit the race if he performs poorly in South Carolina, saying Bush has worked hard and has a right to be in this race as long as he wants to be. I mean, hes spent $50 million attacking me. If there are differences in policy well talk about it. What Ive said about Governor Bush is he doesnt have any foreign policy experience, which is true. But I dont view that as an attack. I view that as a fact, Rubio told reporters on Wednesday. Bush has bristled at the charge, telling supporters he has visited 89 countries and seen his brother and father develop foreign policy as U.S. presidents. His team has made much of Rubios having missed many  hearings and votes as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Its hard for me to be lectured to by a gifted young guy who thinks going to committee hearings means you know something about the world, Bush said. Rubio forces had wanted to knock Bush out of the race in New Hampshire, the last nominating contest held on Feb. 9, but a bad Rubio debate performance and a strong campaign trail performance by Bush thwarted those hopes with Bush edging his rival for a fourth-place finish.

Bush hires Ohio political veteran as national adviser,"CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Republican Jeb Bushs presidential campaign has added an Ohio political veteran to his team as a national political adviser. A Bush aide said on Wednesday that Bob Paduchik, who was the Ohio campaign manager for the 2000 and 2004 presidential campaigns of Jebs brother George W. Bush, is joining the Bush campaign. Paduchik also managed Ohio Republican Senator Rob Portmans campaign for the Senate in 2010, among other political jobs in the state. In addition, the Bush team said that Bush, fighting for a strong showing in the South Carolina Republican primary on Saturday, had secured the help of long-time Virginia Republican fundraiser Bobbie Kilberg. Kilberg had been helping the presidential campaign of Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who dropped out of the race after finishing far back in the pack in the Feb. 9 New Hampshire primary.

"Obama to meet Raul Castro, dissidents on historic trip to Cuba","WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will meet dissidents and President Raul Castro in Cuba next month, the White House said on Thursday, announcing a historic trip that will be another major step toward ending decades of animosity between former Cold War foes. In the first visit by a U.S. president to the Caribbean nation since 1928, Obama will meet entrepreneurs and people from different walks of life during the trip on March 21 and 22, but he is unlikely to see Fidel Castro, the former president and revolutionary leader, U.S. officials said. The White House hopes Obamas trip will help accelerate change on the Communist-run island and cement progress made under his watch, but Republicans at home complained that it would give legitimacy to Cubas oppressive government. Next month, Ill travel to Cuba to advance our progress and efforts that can improve the lives of the Cuban people, Obama wrote on Twitter. After decades of hostility following Cubas 1959 revolution, the two countries agreed in 2014 to move to reopen ties, but the U.S. embargo on Cuba remains and Washington frequently criticizes Havanas human rights record.     The opening to Cuba was a diplomatic feat that is likely to form part of Obamas foreign policy legacy along with the nuclear deal he struck with another long-time U.S. foe, Iran. Officials decided that traveling to Cuba now rather than at the end of Obamas term would give them more leverage to make progress on expanding Internet access and opening up business opportunities for Cubans and Americans. Obama regularly meets with civil society groups when he travels abroad, and officials said this trip would be no different. Hell be meeting with dissidents, with members of civil society, including those who certainly oppose the Cuban governments policies, Obamas deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, told reporters.     Josefina Vidal, the director of U.S. affairs for the Cuban Foreign Ministry, said the Cuban government is willing to talk with the United States about its concerns. Cuba is open to speak to the U.S. government about any topic, including human rights, Vidal told reporters. She said the Cuban government wants Guantanamo Bay returned to Cuba and the embargo lifted before relations can be normalized. Cuban dissidents gave a cautious welcome to the trip. He should take advantage of this opportunity to send a loud, clear message, prominent opposition blogger Yoani Sanchez wrote on her website. The material and moral poverty that surrounds us is not the responsibility of the United States. The United States has upheld a strict economic embargo on Cuba for more than 50 years, providing the Cuban government with a strong propaganda tool against Washington. Obamas visit is likely to spark debate in the campaign for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, particularly in the swing voting state of Florida, where many anti-Castro Cuban-Americans live. Two Republican candidates, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, are conservative sons of Cuban immigrants and foreign policy hawks.         Rubio urged Obama to reconsider his trip, citing political arrests in the past year. You will send the message to the oppressed Cuban people that you stand with their oppressors, he said in a letter on Thursday.         First lady Michelle Obama will accompany her husband on the trip to Cuba and also to Argentina. Obamas Havana visit carries huge symbolic value as his administration takes steps to expand commerce with Cuba, only 90 miles (145 km) from Florida. The last sitting U.S. president to visit Cuba was Calvin Coolidge. Tourism has surged recently. Airbnb, an online home-rental site, says U.S. rentals of homes in Cuba are booming. The countries have agreed to restore airline flights, and companies ranging from tractor manufacturers to telecommunications firms are assessing the market.      Cuba and Major League Baseball are discussing holding an exhibition game between the Cuban national team and Tampa Bay Rays in Havana on March 22, raising the possibility that Obama could throw the ceremonial first pitch. Obama still seeks to pressure U.S. lawmakers to remove the decades-old embargo on Cuba but Republicans control Congress and are unlikely to act soon. A persistent congressional critic of the thaw in relations with Cuba, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, said the trip would be a reward that the Cuban government did not deserve. Pitiful that Obama rewards Castros with visit to Cuba while conditions for the Cuban people are getting worse, said      Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban-American Republican from south Florida. Rhodes said he expected Cuban officials would bring up the status of the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay during the trip, but the administration opposes returning the area to the Communist government.  The White House did not provide details about which groups Obama would seek to meet, and said the United States would like to see more freedom of assembly and speech in Cuba. Cuba says it has no political prisoners but the Cuban Commission of Human Rights and National Reconciliation, a dissident group, counts about 80 political prisoners in detention.  Fifty-three were released around the time of the 2014 agreement to normalize relations with the United States, but others were arrested last year, the group said.

Supreme Court denies stay request in North Carolina redistricting case,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday refused to stay a ruling that two North Carolina congressional districts be redrawn over racial gerrymandering in a 2011 redistricting, forcing congressional primaries to be rescheduled for June 7. A lower court panel of federal judges this month barred elections in the majority black districts, the 1st and the 12th, until new maps are approved, calling the current maps unconstitutional.  The Supreme Court gave no explanation for its decision in a one-sentence order issued late on Friday night. The ruling said race had been the main factor when the Republican-controlled legislature redrew the boundaries and state lawmakers were not justified in using that benchmark. Three voters filed suit in 2013 to invalidate the districts. Both are represented by Democrats, with G.K. Butterfield in the 1st, and Alma Adams in the 12th. The primaries for the states 13 U.S. House seats will be held on June 7 rather than March 15 after North Carolina lawmakers agreed to move the date on Thursday if the Supreme Court rejected the stay request. The states presidential and gubernatorial primaries will still be held on March 15.   Broadcaster WRAL reported that while state lawmakers hoped for a stay, legislators in the states House on Friday moved ahead and gave final approval to newly-drafted congressional maps ahead of the Courts decision to reject the stay request. Politico reported that Justice Antonin Scalia had been expected to vote in favor of staying the ruling before his death last Saturday, though it was not immediately clear how his death affected the courts decision.

Obama digs into research on potential Supreme Court picks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will review briefing documents from his staff this weekend on potential Supreme Court nominees, the White House said on Friday, as a tough political fight loomed with Senate Republicans over filling the pivotal vacancy. The White House arranged for photographers to snap pictures of Obama carrying a thick binder filled with papers during his walk from the Oval Office to his residence on Friday night as he ponders who to pick to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13. Earlier in the day, the president and first lady Michelle Obama paid respects to Scalia as the late justices body lay in repose in the Supreme Courts Great Hall. The presidents team, over the course of this week, has spent a lot of time preparing materials for the presidents review, and I would expect, over the weekend, that the president will begin to dig into the materials that have been prepared for him, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. Earnest gave no clues about who Obama might pick but said the lengthy briefing materials included information about some potential nominees including career accomplishments and experience. The courts ideological balance of power is at stake, and Obamas nominee could tip it to the left for the first time in decades. Scalias death left the court with four conservative and four liberal justices. Obama phoned Senate leaders, including Republicans who have threatened to block any nominee made by the Democratic president to replace Scalia. Obama made it clear in his calls with two key Senate Republicans, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, that he will nominate someone for the job, Earnest told reporters. McConnell has said the seat should remain vacant until Obamas successor takes office next January so voters can have a say in the selection when they choose a new president in the Nov. 8 election. Obama also spoke with Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid and Senator Patrick Leahy, the Judiciary Committees top Democrat, Earnest said. Reid said on Thursday after speaking with Obama that he expected the president to name his pick in a little over three weeks. Earnest declined to discuss a timetable for Obamas decision, and said the presidents staff had not yet provided a short list of candidates. ",politicsNews,"February 19, 2016 ",1
Pope's comments on Trump not a personal attack: papal spokesman,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Franciss suggestion that Donald Trump was not Christian because of his views on immigration was not a personal attack on the U.S. Republican presidential candidate, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said on Friday. Lombardi told Vatican Radio that the popes comments, made to reporters during a flight back from Mexico in response to a specific question on Trump, were simply an affirmation of his long-standing belief that migrants should be helped rather than shut off behind walls. In no way was this a personal attack, nor an indication of how to vote, Lombardi said. Trump, the longtime Republican party front-runner in opinion polls, dismissed the pope as disgraceful for questioning his faith. He has said that if elected president in November, he would build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border to keep out immigrants who enter illegally. Lombardi said the pope believed people should build bridges, not walls. He added: This is his general view, which is very consistent with courageously following the indications of the gospel on offering welcome and solidarity. ",politicsNews,"February 19, 2016 ",1
U.S. proposes hike in Medicare Advantage payments; insurer shares rise,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Friday proposed raising payments by 1.35 percent on average next year to the health insurers who offer Medicare Advantage health benefits to elderly and disabled Americans. Payments to insurers will vary under the 2017 Medicare Advantage proposal, based on the region the plans are sold and on the size of bonus payments insurers can receive based on quality ratings, the government said. Shares of health insurers rose in after-hours trade. Analysts said the proposal looked positive for insurers at first glance, but cautioned that they needed to parse it fully. Looks like the best case scenario has played itself out,  said Ipsita Smolinski of Capitol Street, a Washington D.C. research firm, who had anticipated about 1 percent increase in payments. Insurers and lawmakers have pressured the government not to cut payments, saying any decrease would hurt older Americans by forcing insurers to cut benefits.  Insurer lobbyist Americas Health Insurance Plans President Marilyn Tavenner said it was important that the final policy ensure the long-term stability of Medicare Advantage. She said in a statement that the group was looking closely at the proposal. About 17 million Americans have healthcare coverage through Medicare Advantage, offered by insurers including UnitedHealth Group Inc, Aetna Inc, and Anthem Inc among others. Another more than 30 million people receive benefits through the government Medicare fee-for-service program. Shares of Anthem Inc rose 1.4 percent in after-hours trading, while UnitedHealth Group gained 1.6 percent.  Some insurers may benefit more than others from the proposal to pay more to insurers who are managing plans for people who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid for the poor, said Kim Monk, managing director of Capital Alpha Partners. The 1.35 percent increase is based mostly on anticipated medical cost increases next year. The government expects a 3 percent payment growth rate, which is in line with estimates the government provided to insurers in December.  That 3 percent increase is then reduced to 1.35 percent due to lower payments to insurers for sicker-than-average customers and some medical coding changes, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Medicare agency said on Friday.  The 1.35 percent also takes into account an increase in how it pays insurers based on quality measures, called star ratings, it said. The final rate for 2017 Medicare Advantage payments is based on this proposed figure and will be released in April. ",politicsNews,"February 19, 2016 ",1
"White House, House Republicans spar over Zika, Ebola funding","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday that it would be profoundly unwise to plow money set aside for Ebola-related projects into research and mitigation efforts for the mosquito-borne Zika virus as several top Republican lawmakers have requested. Democratic President Barack Obama has asked the U.S. Congress for more than $1.8 billion to fight Zika in the United States and abroad, and pursue a vaccine. But three key Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives have said they think the government should instead draw from $2.7 billion that has not yet used for public health projects overseas. The Zika virus has been linked to birth defects in Brazil and spread to at least 31 other countries and territories, mostly in the Americas. Representative Hal Rogers, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, and Representatives Kay Granger and Tom Cole, who are appropriators for Health and Human Services and the State Department, made their request in a letter to the White House on Thursday. If the aim of the request is to mount as rapid a response as possible, it is clear to us that the most expeditious way to identify the needed funding is to maximize the use of unobligated funds previously provided for Ebola, the lawmakers said. Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of the Republican Senate leadership team, said earlier this month that Obama should repurpose Ebola funds for the new Zika fight. But White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the unspent Ebola money was needed to build up the public health infrastructure of countries overseas to help prevent future epidemics. West Africa was stricken by a two-year Ebola epidemic that killed more than 11,300 people starting in December 2013 and led to cases in the United States.  Its critically important that we follow through on those efforts and it would be profoundly unwise to take money away from the ongoing effort thats need to fight Ebola, Earnest said. Earnest said that the White House would soon put forward a formal Zika funding request for lawmakers. It will include a plan to redirect some Ebola funds to the Zika fight, but Earnest said new funding was also require. Much remains unknown about Zika, including whether the virus actually causes microcephaly, a condition marked by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems. Brazil said it has confirmed more than 500 cases of microcephaly, and considers most of them to be related to Zika infections in the mothers. Brazil is investigating more than 3,900 additional suspected cases of microcephaly. ",politicsNews,"February 19, 2016 ",1
Shift in U.S. sanctions could ground Russian rocket engines: general,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force would ground the Russian-built RD-180 engines that power its Atlas 5 rockets if a U.S. government review determines that several sanctioned Russian individuals have too close a relationship with the engine maker, a top U.S. general said on Friday. Lieutenant General Samuel Greaves, who heads the Air Forces Space and Missile Systems Center, said the Pentagon was reviewing responses about the sanctions issue and related matters in time to meet a Feb. 22 deadline set by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain. McCain last week asked the Air Force and Pentagon to explain why the U.S. government is continuing to use engines built by Russias NPO Energomash given sanctions in place against Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin and other sanctioned individuals, who control the company after a big reorganization. Congress banned use of the Russian RD-180 rocket engines for military use after 2019, following Russias annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014.  But U.S. lawmakers eased the ban late last year, worried that it could drive United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co, out of business and leave only privately-held SpaceX, to lift satellites into space. Greaves said the Air Force would abide by U.S. law. These folks are on the sanctions list, and if the Department of the Treasury comes back and says theres a problem with that relationship, then we have to work with the Congress and others to determine a way ahead, he said. Asked to elaborate about possible consequences, he said, If were not supposed to be flying the RD-180s, theyre grounded. The Treasury Department declined comment. A spokeswoman for United Launch Alliance also had no immediate comment. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims had ruled on the issue in response to a lawsuit filed in April 2014 by SpaceX, concluding that the purchases were not in violation of U.S. sanctions. At the time, senior U.S. officials said that control of Energomash by Rogozin could  provide a basis for formally blocking the property and interests of the company. McCain argues the situation has changed due to a new Russian law that took effect in January, which consolidated the Russian space industry under a single state corporation, Roscosmos. Roscosmos is due to merge with the state-owned parent company of Energomash, making Energomash a direct subsidiary, he said. ",politicsNews,"February 19, 2016 ",1
Texas official to retire after criticizing Planned Parenthood cuts,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A senior Texas health official who co-authored a report that criticized the states funding cuts to Planned Parenthood for reducing access to reproductive healthcare will retire from his post next month, a Texas commission said on Friday. Rick Allgeyer, the Texas Health and Human Services Commissions director of research, faced criticism from the states Republican leaders over the report published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine this month. The report said state funding cuts to Planned Parenthood and its affiliates had an adverse effect on family planning for lower-income people. Allgeyer is eligible to retire and decided to do so effective on March 31, the commission said. Allgeyer, who has been at the commission for 16 years and was one of the studys five listed authors, declined to comment. In 2011, the Texas state legislature cut Planned Parenthood out of one family-planning program and revamped the way another program hands out funds, placing it and other private clinics at the bottom of the list. Top Texas political leaders have said after cutting off funding for Planned Parenthood that the state has been able to rebuild its safety net.  Independent health experts dispute the claim, saying Texas still has a long way to go before it can provide the level of service it did when Planned Parenthood was an integral part of its family planning efforts. The Texas plan has garnered attention among Republicans in the U.S. Congress who are looking to defund the nations largest family-planning provider at the national level.    The study said the cuts appeared to lead to an increase of unintended pregnancies among lower-income residents and a decrease in access to long-acting reversible contraception. It also said the cuts appeared to increase the rate of childbirths covered by Medicaid. Some Texas Republicans said it was inappropriate for a state employee to be involved in such a study and that its results were flawed, putting political pressure on Allgeyer.

Most Americans want Obama to nominate Scalia's replacement: Reuters/Ipsos,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A majority of Americans believe it should be up to President Barack Obama to nominate the next U.S. Supreme Court justice, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found on Thursday, with opinion divided along ideological party lines. The death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia last week sparked an intense debate between Republicans and Democrats over whether Obama, a Democrat, should nominate Scalias replacement before he leaves office, or whether the seat should be left open until a new president takes office in January. Concerned that any appointee Obama selects would tip the nine-justice court in liberals favor, Republicans in the U.S. Congress and on the presidential campaign trail have said the replacement should be chosen by the next president. The White House has said Obama intends to do as the U.S. Constitution requires and move promptly to nominate a successor. The nominee must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The poll showed that 54 percent of Americans believed Obama should make the nomination. The support overwhelmingly came from Democrats, with 81 percent of them saying they supported Obama nominating Scalias successor. Among Republicans, only 27 percent said they either strongly or somewhat supported Obama making the pick. Democrats and Republican also had different priorities when it comes to picking a Supreme Court nominee, according to the poll. A majority, or 67 percent, of Democrats said they wanted someone pragmatic and willing to compromise, with 53 percent of Republicans saying they wanted someone ideologically pure. Despite its polarizing effect, the Supreme Court issue does not appear to be a priority issue for voters surveyed. More Americans think the executive and legislative branches of government wield greater influence than the judiciary, the poll showed, and fewer than 10 percent thought nominating justices to the high court was a presidential duty most relevant to them. A third of those surveyed said they were not aware of Scalias death, which first made headlines on Saturday. The poll of 1,108 adults, including 460 Democrats and 426 Republicans, was conducted Tuesday to Thursday. It had a credibility interval of about 5 percentage points.

Biden says Obama won't be able to pick the 'most liberal jurist',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama cannot select the most liberal possible candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court and should seek a consensus pick who could attract Republican support, Vice President Joe Biden said on Thursday. A fierce political fight is brewing as the Democratic president prepares to name a successor to conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Saturday. Obamas nominee could change the courts balance of power. Scalias death left it with four conservative and four liberal justices. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid told MSNBC in an interview that he spoke with Obama on Thursday about the nomination and expected the president to name his choice in a little over three weeks.  Many Republicans, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have said the seat should remain vacant until Obamas successor takes office next January so voters can have a say in the selection when they choose a new president in the Nov. 8 election.  The Senate gets to have a say, Biden, a former senator, told Minnesota Public Radio in an interview broadcast on Thursday. In order to get this done, the president is not going to be able to go out, nor would it be his instinct anyway, to pick the most liberal jurist in the nation and put them on the court. The Senate, whose Republican majority would be unlikely to embrace any selection seen as particularly liberal, must confirm nominees picked for lifetime appointments to the nations highest court.  There are plenty of judges who are on high courts already who have had unanimous support of the Republicans. This should be someone who, in fact, is a consensus and whereby we can generate enough support to get a person passed, Biden said. In a separate interview broadcast on MSNBC, Biden said he would be deeply involved in advising Obama but that he had no desire himself to be named to the high court. Biden told MSNBC the president had sought his advice but they had yet to discuss potential candidates. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Obama would draw on Bidens perspective, noting the vice president had served as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman and presided over confirmation hearings for past Supreme Court nominees. Those included the contentious 1991 hearings for Justice Clarence Thomas.  Separately, retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day OConnor, the first woman to serve on the court and a nominee of Republican President Ronald Reagan, took issue with Republicans who are demanding that Obamas successor pick the person to fill Scalias vacancy. I dont agree, OConnor, 85, told an Arizona television station. We need somebody in there to do the job - and just get on with it.  Some Republican senators have urged their leaders at least to allow the customary Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings to proceed on any Obama nominee. I do believe that the nominee should get a hearing, Senator Lisa Murkowski told reporters in her home state of Alaska on Wednesday.  She added: That doesnt necessarily mean that ends up in a vote by the Senate to confirm the nominee. Senators Dean Heller of Nevada and Thom Tillis of North Carolina this week also indicated support for allowing the Senate to consider Obamas nominee. Obama will not attend Scalias funeral on Saturday, a decision that provoked criticism from some conservatives. Earnest rebuked critics who he said want to use the funeral of the Supreme Court justice as some sort of political cudgel. Earnest noted Obama would pay his respects by going to the Supreme Court building on Friday when Scalias body will be lying in repose, and Biden would represent the Obama administration at the funeral. Obamas presence at public events requires a massive retinue of Secret Service agents and security measures, while Bidens security footprint is a little bit lighter, Earnest said, noting the White House had sought a respectful arrangement.  A CBS News poll and a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed Americans closely split along partisan lines on whether Obama should name Scalias successor. ",politicsNews,"February 18, 2016 ",1
Apple likely to invoke free-speech rights in encryption fight,"NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) will likely seek to invoke the United States protections of free speech as one of its key legal arguments in trying to block an order to help unlock the encrypted iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters, lawyers with expertise in the subject said this week. The company on Thursday was granted three additional days by the court to file a response to the order. Apple will now have until Feb. 26 to send a reply, a person familiar with matter told Reuters. The tech giant and the Obama administration are on track for a major collision over computer security and encryption after a federal magistrate judge in Los Angeles handed down an order on Tuesday requiring Apple to provide specific software and technical assistance to investigators. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook called the request from the Federal Bureau of Investigation unprecedented. Other tech giants such as Facebook Inc (FB.O), Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Alphabet Incs (GOOGL.O) Google have rallied to support Apple. Apple has retained two prominent, free-speech lawyers to do battle with the government, according to court papers: Theodore Olson, who won the political-speech case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2010, and Theodore Boutrous, who frequently represents media organizations. Government lawyers from the U.S. Justice Department have defended their request in court papers by citing various authorities, such as a 1977 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld an order compelling a telephone company to provide assistance with setting up a device to record telephone numbers. The high court said then that the All Writs Act, a law from 1789, authorized the order, and the scope of that ruling is expected to be a main target of Apple when it files a response in court by early next week. But Apple will likely also broaden its challenge to include the First Amendments guarantee of speech rights, according to lawyers who are not involved in the dispute but who are following it.  Compared with other countries, the United States has a strong guarantee of speech rights even for corporations, and at least one court has ruled that computer code is a form of speech, although that ruling was later voided. Apple could argue that being required to create and provide specific computer code amounts to unlawful compelled speech, said Riana Pfefferkorn, a cryptography fellow at Stanford Universitys Center for Internet and Society. The order against Apple is novel because it compels the company to create a new forensic tool to use, not just turn over information in Apples possession, Pfefferkorn said. I think there is a significant First Amendment concern, she said. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorneys Office in Los Angeles declined to comment on the possible free-speech questions on Thursday.      A speech-rights argument from Apple, though, could be met with skepticism by the courts because computer code has become ubiquitous and underpins much of the U.S. economy.  That is an argument of enormous breadth, said Stuart Benjamin, a Duke University law professor who writes about the First Amendment. He said Apple would need to show that the computer code conveyed a substantive message. In a case brought by a mathematician against U.S. export controls, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers California, found in 1999 that the source code behind encryption software is protected speech. The opinion was later withdrawn so the full court could rehear the case, but that rehearing was canceled and the appeal declared moot after the government revised its export controls. The FBI and prosecutors are seeking Apples assistance to read the data on an iPhone 5C that had been used by Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, carried out the San Bernardino shootings that killed 14 people and wounded 22 others at a holiday party. U.S. prosecutors were smart to pick the mass shooting as a test case for an encryption fight with tech companies, said Michael Froomkin, a University of Miami law professor. That is because the shooting had a large emotional impact while also demonstrating the danger posed by armed militants, he said. In addition, the iPhone in dispute was owned not by Farook but by his employer, a local government, which has consented to the search of the iPhone. The federal magistrate who issued the order, Sheri Pym, is also a former federal prosecutor. This is one of the worst set of facts possible for Apple. Thats why the government picked this case, Froomkin said.  Froomkin added, though, that the fight was enormously important for the company because of the possibility that a new forensic tool could be easily used on other phones and the damage that could be done to Apples global brand if it cannot withstand government demands on privacy. All these demands make their phones less attractive to users, he said. ",politicsNews,"February 19, 2016 ",1
Pope says Trump 'not Christian' in a sign of global concern,"NEWBERRY, S.C. (Reuters) - Pope Francis forcefully injected himself into the U.S. presidential campaign on Thursday, assailing Republican candidate Donald Trumps views on U.S. immigration as not Christian in a sign of growing international concern at the billionaire businessmans election prospects. Trump struck back. No stranger to controversy, the longtime party front-runner in national opinion polls dismissed the leader of the worlds Roman Catholics as disgraceful for questioning his faith. He said he was a proud Christian. Francis told reporters during a free-wheeling conversation on his flight home from a visit to Mexico: A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian. Trump has accused Mexico of sending rapists and drug-runners across the United States southern border and has vowed if elected president to build a wall to keep out immigrants who enter illegally. It was not the first time U.S. allies have voiced concern over comments by Trump.  More than half a million Britons signed a petition to bar him from entering Britain, where he has business interests, in response to his call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. British lawmakers decided against a ban as a violation of free speech. Asked if American Catholics should vote for someone with Trumps views, Francis said: I am not going to get involved in that. I say only that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that. We must see if he said things in that way and in this I give the benefit of the doubt.  It remained to be seen if the popes comments would strengthen Trump in the run-up to the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. Trumps swipes at rival candidates and heated exchanges with others have bolstered his standing in nominating contests and opinion polls. One of Trumps Republican rivals, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, speaking in Columbia, South Carolina, said he would not question anyones relationship with God. But Bush, a Catholic, said: It only enables bad behavior when someone from outside our country talks about Donald Trump. Trump, a real estate developer and former reality TV show host, said: If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president. ISIS is one of the acronyms used for Islamic State.  Trump was in South Carolina, which on Saturday will hold a Republican nominating contest. At a later town hall meeting televised on CNN, Trump said he had a lot of respect for Francis but that the pope had been influenced by hearing only Mexicos side of the border issue. The popes statement also had been exaggerated by the media, he said. I think he said something much softer than it was originally reported by the media. I think that he heard one side of the story, which is probably by the Mexican government, he said. He didnt see the tremendous strain that the border is causing us with respect to illegal immigration, with the drugs pouring across the border. Thomas Groome, director of the Boston College Center on the Church in the 21st Century, said Francis comments were entirely in keeping with his focus on mercy. The pope is commissioned to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Thats his job, Groome said. So when he was asked a direct question, he gave Trump the benefit of the doubt, he said we have to be sure he said this, but if he said this, it is not Christian. Groome called Trumps suggestion that Islamic State militants would target the Vatican egregious. Now it becomes a challenge to ISIS, he said. Patrick Hornbeck, chairman of the department of theology at Fordham University in New York, said Francis words were not surprising given the poverty he had just seen in Mexico. There is very little common ground between Pope Francis and Donald Trump, Hornbeck said. He predicted the popes words on electoral politics would have little effect on any U.S. Catholics who liked Trump as a candidate. Trump has said he would deport millions of illegal immigrants if he wins the White House. Last week, responding to the popes plan to visit the U.S.-Mexican border, he said Pope Francis did not understand the issues. The pope is a very political person ... I dont think he understands the danger of the open border that we have with Mexico, Trump told the Fox Business Network. Asked about being called a political person, Francis said on Thursday: Thank God he said I was a politician because Aristotle defined the human person as animal politicus. So at least I am a human person. Republican Catholics appear to support Trump more than other Republicans do, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll that showed 43 percent of likely Republican Catholic voters supported Trump, compared with 38 percent of Republican voters generally. The Pew Research Center has said 71 percent of the U.S. population identifies as Christian. That includes the 21 percent of the U.S. population that identifies as Catholic.  The pope was winning the social media battle on Thursday, with overall sentiment negative for Trump and positive for Francis, according to social media analytic firm Zoomph. Author Dan Dicker @Dan_Dicker tweeted: Lets see @realDonaldTrump insult his way out of this. Trumps social media director, Dan Scavino @DanScavino tweeted: Amazing comments from the Pope - considering Vatican City is 100 percent surrounded by massive walls. Evangelical Christian leader Jerry Falwell Jr., who has endorsed Trump, described him as generous to his employees and family, adding: Im convinced hes a Christian. I believe he has faith in Jesus Christ. Trump was not always at odds with the pope. In 2013, the year Francis began his papacy, Trump compared himself to the pope favorably. The new Pope is a humble man, very much like me, which probably explains why I like him so much! Trump tweeted on Christmas Day 2013.

"Facebook, Twitter support Apple on encryption dispute with FBI","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), two of Silicon Valleys most powerful companies, on Thursday backed Apple Incs (AAPL.O) refusal to help the FBI break into an iPhone used by a shooter in the San Bernardino attack, saying that complying would set a dangerous precedent for privacy. It took two days, but the companies entry solidifies a small but powerful band of tech giants supporting Apple in its quest to buck government demands that it says would irreparably damage security and erode consumer trust.  Among the first to come to Apples defense was its chief rival. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai of Alphabet Incs (GOOGL.O) Google tweeted in support of Apple on Wednesday. But other companies are staying mum. Yahoo Inc YHOO.O and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) have yet to weigh in on the case. In characteristic fashion, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey used the service itself to lend support to Apple CEO Tim Cook, tweeting ""We stand with @tim_cook and Apple (and thank him for his leadership)."" (bit.ly/1RbfI5j) In a statement, Facebook said, We will continue to fight aggressively against requirements for companies to weaken the security of their systems. The case has intensified the rift between tech companies and law enforcement over the limits of encryption. And law enforcement groups have been vocal about their support for the Justice Department. Although some firms have remained silent, the industry is firmly on Apples side, said Aaron Levie, CEO of cloud-based storage provider Box Inc (BOX.N).  Companies choose to use their political capital when it is really important or relevant to them, Levie said.If individually pressed you would see the same message from essentially any Internet or hardware or enterprise software CEO or company, and thats because the fundamental security model of our technology would break if you were to comply with this kind of order. Levie said he unequivocally supports Cooks stance. The whole grounds on which Apple is standing on are just super important, he said.  At the center of the case is an iPhone used by Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people and wounded 22 in a shooting rampage in San Bernardino, California. The young married couple sympathized with Islamic State militants, and government investigators want the data on the phone to learn more about their activities the day of the shooting and their contacts with either accomplices or Islamic State. Apples Cook had said the courts demand threatened the security of Apples customers and had implications far beyond the legal case at hand. ",politicsNews,"February 19, 2016 ",1
Key U.S. lawmaker suggests openness to encryption legislation after Apple order,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. lawmaker expressed a new willingness to support legislation establishing ground rules for when technology firms should grant authorities access to their products, after Apple Inc (AAPL.O) said it would fight a court order to unlock an iPhone linked to the San Bernardino shooting rampage.  Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday that the complex issues raised by the Apple case, as well as the prevalence of strongly encrypted devices and communications, will ultimately need to be resolved by Congress, the administration and industry, rather than the courts alone. Two weeks ago, Schiff told reporters he considered a legislative approach to the issue neither feasible or even desirable. On Tuesday, a federal judge in Los Angeles said that Apple must provide reasonable technical assistance to investigators seeking to unlock the data on an iPhone that had been used by San Bernardino shooter Rizwan Farook, who, with his wife, killed 14 people on Dec. 2.  Apple said it would fight the court order, which it said would set a dangerous precedent that could ultimately undermine the security of its iPhones.   While lawmakers are far from a consensus on the issue, Schiff said, the courts decision will likely accelerate our consideration of how to weigh the competing privacy, security and competitiveness issues. Schiffs pivot could signal renewed interest from lawmakers in an encryption debate that so far has found little traction in Congress. The House Judiciary Committee is planning to hold a hearing on encryption on March 1 and has invited Apple to attend, according to a congressional source. Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate intelligence panel respectively, have said they want to pursue encryption legislation, though neither has introduced a bill yet. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous sources, reported on Thursday that Burr was working on a proposal that would levy criminal penalties on companies that did not comply with court orders to decrypt communications, though it said negotiations were still fluid.  However, Burrs spokeswoman Becca Watkins told Reuters he  is not considering criminal penalties in his draft encryption proposals. Momentum for a law that would require companies to provide government access to the contents of encrypted devices relevant to a criminal investigation faltered last summer when the White House stopped pushing for a bill amid intense opposition from technology companies and privacy advocates.  It is difficult to gauge the Apple cases impact on Congress, as both the Senate and House of Representatives are on recess this week.  But congressional aides say any encryption legislation likely still faces a steep climb. That is especially true in the House, which in 2014 passed an amendment to a defense funding bill that would have barred the government from forcing an organization to build a technical backdoor into its products. The measure was later removed during negotiations. Federal officials have privately dismissed a theory that  the Apple case was choreographed to stir up support for encryption legislation.  But Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said she believed the U.S. Justice Department is pursuing the case in California with one eye on Congress.  Its a win-win for them, she said. If they prevail in court, they dont need a law. And if they lose, they have it set up to go to lawmakers and say: This is what we need, the courts didnt give it to us, so we need a new law.  ",politicsNews,"February 18, 2016 ",1

Will Tim Cook's privacy stance win or lose customers for Apple? ,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Tim Cooks refusal to comply with the U.S. governments request to unlock an iPhone of one of the San Bernardino, California attackers drew strong reaction from critics and supporters this week, but is unclear how the decision will affect potential buyers of the companys products. In an open letter to customers, Cook vowed to fight a court order from a Los Angeles judge to provide reasonable technical assistance to investigators wanting access to the phone of Rizwan Farook, a shooter in the San Bernardino attack that killed 14. Cook said complying with the governments request would set a dangerous precedent that could ultimately undermine the security of its iPhones. Users supporting and opposing Apples position flooded Twitter with rival hashtags #thankyouapple and #boycottapple and Facebook users wrote lengthy posts on the move. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted his support for Cook on Thursday, joining groups like Amnesty International in applauding Cooks stance. Conservative pundit Ann Coulter was among Cooks many critics, suggesting in a social media post that Apple made the move for PR purposes.  Branding expert Allen Adamson, founder of Brand Simple Consulting, praised Cooks forthright note to customers.  Corporate leaders are better off having a very clear, principled view that customers can either agree or disagree with rather than having ambiguity and lack of clarity as to what the company stands for, said Adamson, whose New York-based firm advises companies on volatile branding matters. Adamson and other branding experts said Cooks open letter was important in getting ahead of the debate, even if its users do not necessarily support the companys decision. Apple has come under fire from Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates like Donald Trump, but the company has also rallied support among privacy advocates.  This is a lightning rod issue in the country right now and it is hugely emotional and polarizing. It is still unclear how it will connect with consumers, said Adamson. Other analysts also pointed to Apples brand power as a likely shield against any immediate backlash from consumers. A recent survey of 44,000 consumers by branding consulting firm Brand Keys Inc found the company leading other major tech brands in virtually all categories from devices to services on customer engagement and loyalty.  They have an extraordinary high level of emotional engagement with consumers, said Brand Keys president Robert Passikoff. A steady stream of customers visited the Apple store in downtown San Francisco on Thursday, and shoppers seemed unfazed by the controversy. I buy from Apple because of the product quality. This doesnt affect our decision to buy from them, said Esther Stearns, a retired tech worker. ",politicsNews,"February 19, 2016 ",1

Biden says 'no desire' to be on Supreme Court: MSNBC,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said on Thursday that he will be deeply involved in advising President Barack Obama on picking a candidate for the Supreme Court but said he had no desire himself to be named to the nations highest court. Obama is preparing to name a successor to conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Saturday. The appointment could change the courts balance of power, and many Republican senators want to wait until after the Nov. 8 presidential election to give their consent to a new justice. Biden, who was a long-time chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in an interview that Obama has asked for his advice on who to choose, and believes the president will choose a consensus candidate. I havent even had a chance to sit down with him yet to talk about the potential candidates, Biden told MSNBCs Rachel Maddow. When we do, as in the past, lay out all the people, go out and survey a little bit, and see who we think meets those criteria and we think could have a chance of being confirmed, he said. Asked directly whether he would do the job, Biden said he was not interested. You never say to a president for certain you wouldnt do anything, but I have no - look at me now - I have no desire to sit on the Supreme Court, none, Biden said. Biden is known for having a good working relationship with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has said the seat should remain vacant until after the election.  Biden said he would be an interlocutor with his friends on Capitol Hill on the issue, but said he did not know whether he could persuade enough senators to support Obamas choice. I will be deeply involved, he said. ",politicsNews,"February 19, 2016 ",1
"Sanders, Trump give union hope in fight for Carrier jobs","INDIANAPOLIS (Reuters) - Duane Oreskowic was speechless when he learned last week that his job would be one of 1,400 lost when his employer, Carrier Corp, moved production to Mexico. But he has found his voice again since learning that Bernie Sanders is interested in his plight. I am a big-time Sanders fan and I hope he can help us, said the 37-year-old assembly specialist. But even if he cant, maybe we can stop this happening to other American workers. The Feb. 9 announcement by United Technologies Corps Carrier unit that it would shift production to Mexico from Indianapolis has thrust the long-term trend of U.S. manufacturing job decline to the foreground of the nations election year agenda.  Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump seized on the announcement to amplify his position that companies such as Carrier should be taxed if they send jobs to low wage countries. Democratic candidate Sanders called Carrier, a maker of air conditioners, an example of how NAFTA and other trade policies have been a disaster for American workers. The 2016 U.S. presidential election is in November. Communities around Indianapolis have witnessed a steady outflow of factory jobs over the past two decades. What made this action different was a YouTube video of the workers getting the news that by Thursday afternoon had more than 3.4 million views, and the political reaction to it.           I came here 30 years ago looking for the American dream, said Hatice Lancaster, 51, originally from Turkey. Maybe I should have gone to Mexico instead.  Chuck Jones, president of United Steelworkers Local 1999, which represents the Carrier workers, said he hopes to use the attention to force Carrier to reverse its decision.  Jones faces a steep climb. Carrier has told the union it can pay Mexican workers $3 an hour versus more than $20 on average in Indianapolis. A spokeswoman for Carrier said the company pays a competitive wage based on local conditions and could not discuss pay levels. Since 1998, the chain-smoking, plain-spoken and profane Jones has watched the number of factories represented by his local dwindle to 12 from 38. He and his staff can rattle off the names of plants that have closed.  We didnt ask for this fight, Jones said. But we have to draw a line in the sand somewhere. Jones is now giving interviews to anyone who asks - he was interrupted by multiple phone calls seeking comment while talking to Reuters  - in the hope this time America will pay attention and do something about rampant corporate greed.  Jones is grateful that Trump has drawn public attention to Carrier, but he sees Sanders as a champion for our cause. Jones said he has been contacted by the Sanders campaign. A member of the Sanders campaign said the Vermont senators team would be in touch with Jones. Some Carrier workers interviewed outside the plant said they are drawn to Trump. Brian Easton, 45, said he and his wife work for Carrier, and are now coming to terms with what he said is likely to be a permanent drop in their living standard.  This country is run by Corporate America and we need someone in office like Donald Trump who is not beholden to anyone, Easton said. I dont think he can save our jobs, but if we draw attention to this perhaps other workers wont have to go through this.     ",politicsNews,"February 19, 2016 ",1

Dissidents hope for public recognition from Obama on Cuba visit,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Ostracized by the government and mistrusted by much of the public, Cubas dissidents are hoping to receive a clear message of support from U.S. President Barack Obama when he visits the  island next month. Obama plans to meet dissidents during his March 21-22 visit, the first by a sitting U.S. president since 1928. It follows the rapprochement of December 2014, when Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro ended more than five decades of Cold War-era animosity. Cubas Communist government has long considered the dissidents a tiny and illegitimate minority funded by U.S. interests, while anti-Castro groups hold them up as champions of democracy.  Political opponents say a public blessing from Obama might improve their standing and the cause of human rights in Cuba. Its possible the visit will help raise the hopes of the Cuban people, which is important because Cuba is short on many things, most of all hope, said Elizardo Sanchez, leader of the Cuban Commission of Human Rights and National Reconciliation, which monitors arrests of political opponents. Sanchez said Cuba is holding about 90 political prisoners, including some convicted hijackers and spies and 11 former prisoners out on parole. Cuba says it has no political prisoners.     In addition Cuban officials briefly detain an average of more than 700 dissidents a month, the commission says. Obamas Republican critics have called the visit a capitulation, while Cuban dissidents are mostly supportive. Any gesture of solidarity, any words or gestures, any contact with the peaceful opposition would be well received by the majority of the population, said Jose Daniel Ferrer, leader of the Patriotic Union of Cuba, which says it has about 3,000 members, making it the largest opposition group in Cuba. Cuban Foreign Ministry official Josefina Vidal said Cuba hoped Obama would meet with the real Cuban civil society, a term making a distinction between most Cubans and anti-government activists. Some Cuban dissidents prefer the previous U.S. policy of isolating Cuba and say Obama has failed them. The Ladies in White, who march each Sunday in Havana, say Obama is unwelcome unless he responds to their request that he denounce the repression of activists and calls for amnesty for political prisoners. If he makes a strong statement repudiating these human rights violations, then we will consider it an advance in human rights, said Berta Soler, leader of the group. In practice, we have not seen a thing. ",politicsNews,"February 18, 2016 ",1
Pope's comments on Trump's Christianity spark jokes on Twitter,"(Reuters) - Pope Franciss remarks on Thursday that U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is not Christian due to his views on immigration sparked jokes on social media, and the pope quickly trended on Twitter in the United States. The businessman and former reality TV star called the popes comments disgraceful and said he was proud to be a Christian. Twitter users poked fun at the brouhaha. Watching Trump fight with the Pope might be the most fun you can have with your clothes on, tweeted actor Albert Brooks (@AlbertBrooks). Television comedy writer Wendy Molyneux (@WendyMolyneux) joked about the controversy by attributing a fake quotation to Trump that mocked the presidential candidates penchant for bawdy exaggeration. You know, a lot of my friends are Popes, and they love what Im doing. This one Pope is such a loser. And fat. - @realDonaldTrump, Molyneux wrote Thursday. Paul Begala (@PaulBegala), a political consultant who is an adviser to a Super PAC helping Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, said: How long before realDonaldTrump says the Pope is totally broke. Doesnt own a single golf course. Never even dated a supermodel. #Loser. How dare the pope be concerned with the poor & disenfranchised! I mean Jesus never was! tweeted actor Rainn Wilson (@rainnwilson). The Late Show, hosted by comedian Stephen Colbert, tweeted a poll Thursday in which it asked How can Donald Trump get back in the Popes good graces? The options listed were Cabinet position, Purchase indulgences, Evict Protestants and Sensual back rub. Trump, long the leader in national opinion polls, and five Republican rivals face off on Saturday in South Carolinas primary. While the pope and Trump are now at odds, the real estate developer had previously praised the pontiff. In 2013, the year Francis began his papacy, Trump compared himself to the pope favorably. On Christmas Day 2013: Trump tweeted, The new Pope is a humble man, very much like me, which probably explains why I like him so much!  The pope was not the only powerful figure to run afoul of the Republican candidate on Thursday. Media titan Rupert Murdoch weighed in on Twitter to contest Trumps claims that Fox News is biased against him after a national poll by NBC and the Wall Street Journal showed Senator Ted Cruz inching ahead of Trump. Trump blames me for WSJ poll, fights FoxNews, tweeted Murdoch (@rupertmurdoch), executive chairman of both Fox News parent 21st Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O)  and Journal owner News Corp (NWSA.O).

Treasury's Weiss to be witness at House Puerto Rico hearing: official,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico will be the subject of two U.S. House of Representatives hearings on Feb. 25, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Counselor Antonio Weiss the sole witness at one, Pedro Pierluisi, the islands non-voting representative in Congress, said in a statement on Thursday. Following the hearings, Pierluisi said he expected that the drafting process would begin in earnest for legislation for the island and that he would be involved in negotiations.  Republicans plan to bring a bill addressing Puerto Ricos debt crisis to the floor of the House by the end of March. The first hearing next Thursday, examining the impact of Puerto Ricos fiscal crisis on the bond market, will be in a subcommittee of the House Committee on Financial Services. The second, examining the Treasurys analysis of the island, will be a full committee hearing before the House Natural Resources Committee, according to Pierluisis statement. Puerto Rico, with around $70 billion in debt, has been trying to solve a fiscal crisis before substantial debt payments come due in May and July. It has already defaulted on some debt and is trying to persuade its creditors to take concessions. ",politicsNews,"February 18, 2016 ",1
Puerto Rico may have better chance of Supreme Court win after Scalia death,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financially troubled Puerto Ricos push for a debt restructuring program could get a lift from the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who was viewed as likely to oppose granting such relief in an upcoming U.S. Supreme Court case. The highest U.S. federal court in December agreed to hear Puerto Ricos bid to reinstate a 2014 law called the Recovery Act after it was struck down by a lower court.  The government of the U.S. territory, which has around $70 billion in borrowings, hoped the act would help it to restructure its debt and pull it out of a fiscal crisis. It would give the Caribbean island more power to impose conditions on creditors in a debt restructuring, which could worsen creditor recoveries, bondholders had argued.  Scalia has been a fairly aggressive defender of contractual rights over the years, said Height Securities analyst Daniel Hanson, who estimated the chances of a Puerto Rico victory have risen to around 30 percent from five percent after Scalias death. Scalia, who served on the Supreme Court for nearly 30 years, died at a ranch in Texas last Saturday, setting up a major political showdown between President Barack Obama and the Republican-controlled Senate over who will replace him on the nine-member court. A Supreme Court victory could help strengthen the arguments of island officials and a number of Democrats in their campaign to give Puerto Rico bankruptcy protection rights, which U.S. states already receive. That effort has been stunted by lack of Republican support. The Recovery Act was designed to apply to some of Puerto Ricos public corporations, such as utility PREPA, but excluded debt issued by the island and its Government Development Bank.  PREPA bondholders Oppenheimer Funds and Franklin Templeton sued Puerto Rico, claiming the act would enable Puerto Rico to modify debt obligations. A U.S. federal court in Puerto Rico a year ago voided the Recovery Act saying it contravened federal bankruptcy law, and a U.S. appeals court affirmed that last July.  The Puerto Rican government and its lawyers, as well as a representative for the bondholder plaintiffs, did not respond to requests for comment or declined comment. Scalias death means that only seven justices are likely to vote on the Puerto Rico case as Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative, who had investments in funds with Puerto Rico bonds, last year recused himself.  If there had been a tied 4-4 vote it would have automatically upheld the lower courts decision. Alito could still participate if he divests investments before the oral argument.  Of the remainder of the justices, four are viewed as liberals and three as conservatives. The latter are seen by some restructuring experts as more likely to support creditors on the basis of contractual business rights.  The four liberal justices are the justices most likely to be sympathetic to Puerto Ricos arguments, said David Skeel, Professor at the University of Pennsylvania law school, who said Scalias death creates the possibility that the liberal block will prevail by a 4-3 vote. Skeel wrote a brief supporting Puerto Ricos position in the case.    Still, the restructuring experts said that it may be too simple to suggest that Scalia would have voted against Puerto Rico as the case involves complex legal questions. Richard Levin, Co-head of Jenner & Blocks Restructuring and Bankruptcy Department, said the court tries very hard to apply the law, rather than allow political leanings to dominate its decisions. Carlos Del Valle Cruz, counsel for Eduardo Bhatia, president of Puerto Ricos Senate, also said that Scalias absence may favor Puerto Rico.  A complicating factor is a separate case which was just argued in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. That concerns the indictment of two men by Puerto Rico prosecutors on gun charges, and their subsequent indictment by a federal grand jury. Both pleaded guilty to the federal charges and were sentenced to prison but the case in Puerto Rico continued.  The U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli has argued that the Puerto Rico prosecution violated double jeopardy laws that ban trying a defendant twice for the same crime in the same jurisdiction, while Puerto Ricos government countered that its rights to self-governance were threatened. Nicholos Venditti, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, said rulings in both cases could have significant implications for Puerto Rico and the U.S. that reach far beyond the $70 billion in debt.  John Miller, co-head of fixed income for Nuveen Asset Management, which holds around $300 million in par value of insured Puerto Rican paper, said the concern with the Recovery Act being reinstated would be the potential for it to be expanded to other issuers beyond the public agencies it was originally designed for.    Oral arguments in the Supreme Court case are scheduled to be held March 22.  ",politicsNews,"February 18, 2016 ",1
"Ahead of Obama visit, Cuba says ready to talk about rights","HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba is willing to talk with the United States about human rights, its top diplomat for U.S. relations said on Thursday in reference to a historic visit by U.S. President Barack Obama set for March. The White House earlier said Obama would raise Washingtons concerns about rights to free speech, free assembly and independent civil society during his two-day Cuba trip, the first by a sitting U.S. president since 1928. Cuba is open to speak to the U.S. government about any topic, including human rights, Josefina Vidal, director of U.S. affairs for the Cuban Foreign Ministry, told reporters after the White House said Obama would travel to Cuba on March 21-22. The trip follows the two countries move in 2014 to reopen ties after more than 50 years of hostile relations. But Vidal made clear that Cubas idea of what constituted human rights did not coincide with Washingtons perception. We have different ideas (about rights), in the same way that different ideas exist about other topics like democracy, political models and international relations, she told reporters. We hope that President Obama will have the opportunity to converse with the real Cuban civil society, Vidal said, using a term to draw a distinction from the opposition, which the government considers illegitimate. Cuba says critics of its human rights record overlook a low crime rate and guaranteed healthcare and education. Obama will meet with dissidents when he visits Cuba, the White House said. Republicans complained that the trip would lend legitimacy to the islands Communist government.  Anti-government activists face harassment and short-term detention if they gather and protest in Cuba. The Cuban Commission of Human Rights and National Reconciliation, a dissident group, says there has been a spike in such detentions since November.  Cuba released 53 political prisoners around the time of rapprochement in December 2014. But there are still about 90 political prisoners in Cuba, the commission said on Thursday, an increase of about 20 since it issued its annual report in June 2015. The Cuban government see the dissidents as a tiny minority with little public support and financed indirectly by Washington. ",politicsNews,"February 18, 2016 ",1
Wisconsin blocks federal funds from reaching Planned Parenthood,"(Reuters) - Wisconsin Republican Governor Scott Walker signed two bills into law on Thursday that block federal funding from Planned Parenthood and could cost the local organization millions of dollars.   Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin could lose about $7.5 million a year because of the measures, an organization spokeswoman said.  Texas, Louisiana other Republican-controlled states tried to halt funding for the reproductive health organization after an anti-abortion group released videos last summer purported to show Planned Parenthood officials trying to negotiate prices for aborted fetal tissue. Under federal law, donated human fetal tissue may be used for research, but profiting from its sale is prohibited. A grand jury in Texas cleared Planned Parenthood of any wrongdoing and indicted two anti-abortion activists behind the filming of the videos for tampering with a government record and violating a prohibition on the purchase and sale of human organs.     One of the new Wisconsin rules requires the state to apply for federal Title X family planning grant money and to give those monies to less controversial public entities such as state, county and local health departments and clinics, a statement from Walkers office said.  Planned Parenthood is currently the only entity in Wisconsin receiving this federal money and the funds will not be sent to the organization, the statement said.  State entities providing abortions will now bill Medicaid only for acquisition costs and dispensing fees for prescription drugs.  Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin could lose roughly $4 million a year as a result of this measure, depending on patient volume and the type of birth control patients choose, organization spokeswoman Iris Riis said. The legislation singles out Planned Parenthood and is an attempt to stop the organization from providing essential healthcare, the group said.  The move was the latest in a long line of attacks by the Governor and the Republican controlled state Legislature on the health of Wisconsin women and families, the organization said in a statement.   Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin has 22 health centers in the state, three of which offer abortion services, according to its website. Earlier this month, Ohio legislators approved a bill blocking state and federal funds for groups that perform or promote abortions, which cut $1.3 million annually used by Planned Parenthood clinics for HIV testing, pre-natal care and other programs. States including Alabama, Utah and Arkansas have fought losing court battles over their plans to cut funding for local Planned Parenthood operations.  ",politicsNews,"February 18, 2016 ",1

Republican presidential race erupts into four-way battle,"CHARLESTON, S.C./SUMTER, S.C. (Reuters) - The Republican race for the partys 2016 presidential nomination erupted into a four-candidate crossfire on Wednesday over who has the proper experience and is the most conservative, days before South Carolina voters put their stamp on the campaign. In TV interviews and campaign events, front-runner Donald Trump threatened to sue Senator Ted Cruz of Texas over a negative TV ad, while Senator Marco Rubio of Florida accused Cruz of lying about his record, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush questioned Rubios experience to serve as president. Amid the squabbling, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley endorsed Rubio as the Republicans best hope for winning the White House, a boost to Rubio and a blow to Bush, who had lobbied hard for her to pick him. The endorsement gave Rubio, 44, a valuable ally to try to sway voters ahead of Saturdays South Carolina Republican primary, the third contest after Iowa and New Hampshire to pick a party nominee for the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. Bush had a tough day, learning of Haleys endorsement right before a town hall meeting in Summerville, South Carolina, where four members of the audience second-guessed his campaign strategy and offered tips on how to have a greater impact in the state. Much of the debate took place over the television airwaves, as Trump, 69, a billionaire businessman and former reality TV star, lobbed charges at his rivals at an MSNBC town hall, and Rubio and Cruz battled in back-to-back appearances at a CNN town hall in Greenville, South Carolina. Trump fumed about a TV ad put out by the Cruz campaign that brought up Trumps past position in support of a womans right to an abortion. Trump says he has evolved into a conservative and is now against abortion. You look at a guy like Ted Cruz, hes a nasty guy, Trump said. He doesnt have one Republican endorsement from the Senate and he works with the Senate. Think of it. Hard to believe. Cruz dared Trump to sue him over the campaign ad, which featured a 1999 video clip of Trump saying he was very pro-choice on abortion. Cruz said Trump sent his campaign a cease and desist letter demanding it drop the ad. At the CNN town hall, he said he laughed out loud when he got the letter threatening what he called a frivolous lawsuit. In any defamation case, truth is a complete defense, Cruz said. Questioners at the town hall pressed Cruz, 45, on charges leveled against him by Trump that he may not be eligible to be president because he was born in Canada, and that none of his U.S. Senate colleagues liked him. Cruz said he met the constitutional requirement that a president must be a natural born citizen because his mother was an American. As for his Senate colleagues, Cruz said some may not like him because he serves the interests of his constituents, not fellow senators. The latest national Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Trump taking a more than 20-point lead over Cruz in the Republican race. Trump had 40 percent support in the poll conducted from Saturday to Wednesday, compared with 17 percent for Cruz, 11 percent for Rubio, 10 percent for retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, and 8 percent for Bush. The results contrasted with those of an NBC News/Wall Street Journal national poll that put Cruz ahead of Trump among Republicans by 28 percent to 26 percent. Rubio, hoping to overtake Cruz for second place in South Carolina, where Trump leads in the polls, accused Cruz of spreading falsehoods with an ad attacking Rubio over his position on immigration. Rubio backed a 2013 Senate immigration reform effort that collapsed. Cruz says Rubio would have supported amnesty for illegal immigrants, which his rival denies. If you say something that isnt true and you say it over and over and you know its not true, it must be a lie, Rubio said. Bush, running fourth in South Carolina and behind Rubio, questioned Rubios level of experience after Rubio said Bush did not have foreign policy experience. Rubio counts his time on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as valuable experience. Its hard for me to be lectured to by a gifted young guy who thinks going to committee hearings means you know something about the world, Bush said in Summerville. At the event, Bush, 63, the son and brother of former presidents, sounded a note of frustration at frequent criticism of his campaign by TV pundits. The pundits have made it all  its all decided. We dont have to go vote, I guess. Its all finished. I should stop campaigning, maybe, huh? Its all done, he said. No, shouted people in the crowd.

Trump leads Republican field nationally by more than 20 points: poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump has taken a more than 20-point lead over U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the Republican race for the presidential nomination, bolstering his position ahead of the partys primary in South Carolina on Saturday, according to a national Reuters/Ipsos poll. Among Republicans, Trump, a billionaire businessman, drew 40 percent support in the poll conducted from Saturday to Wednesday, compared with 17 percent for Cruz, 11 percent for U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, 10 percent for retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, and 8 percent for former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. The results contrasted with those of a national poll conducted this week by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal that showed Trump dropping into a national dead heat with Cruz in the race for the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. On the Democratic side, the Reuters/Ipsos poll showed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton maintaining about a 10-point national lead over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont since last weeks New Hampshire primary won by Sanders. The Republican results marked a nominal gain for Trump since his win in the Feb. 9 New Hampshire primary, when he led Cruz by 18.4 points in the national rolling survey, although the increase remained within the polls credibility interval. Since he announced his candidacy last summer, Trump has leveraged his celebrity and deep pockets to wage an unfiltered campaign that has upended the Republican primary. He has led the Reuters/Ipsos daily tracking poll since nearly the start of his campaign, topping Bush in late July. The Reuters/Ipsos poll also showed that either Clinton or Sanders would win a hypothetical general election contest with Trump. Clinton would likely win with 44 percent support,  compared with 37 percent for Trump. Sanders would likely win by 44 percent to 35 percent. The poll included responses from 476 registered Republicans and 543 registered Democrats. It had a credibility interval of about 5 percent.

U.S. and EU warn China on need to respect South China Sea ruling,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and the European Union warned China on Wednesday that it should respect an international court ruling expected later this year on its dispute with the Philippines over territory in the South China Sea. China claims virtually all the South China Sea and rejects the authority of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague hearing the dispute, even though Beijing has ratified the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea on which the case is based. Amy Searight, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for South and Southeast Asia, said the United States, the European Union, and allies like Australia, Japan and South Korea must be ready to make clear that the courts ruling must be binding and that there would be costs to China for not respecting it if it lost the case. We need to be ready to be very loud and vocal, in harmony together, standing behind the Philippines and the rest of the ASEAN claimants to say that this is international law, this is incredibly important, it is binding on all parties, she told a seminar at Washingtons Center for Strategic and International Studies. Searight said the message to China, if it did not respect a negative ruling, should be, we will hold you accountable. Certainly, reputational cost is at stake, but we can think  of other creative ways to perhaps impose costs as well, she said without elaborating. The Hague tribunal has no powers of enforcement and its rulings have been ignored before. Manila has said the court may hand down a ruling before May. China disputes South China Sea territory with several other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as well as the Philippines. Klaus Botzet, head of the political section of the EU Delegation in Washington, said it was difficult to oppose world opinion. A joint Western, a joint world opinion, matters also for Beijing, he said. If we unanimously support that international law as formulated by the international tribunal in the Hague ... needs to be upheld, thats a very strong message and will be very difficult to ignore, he said. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said he had noted the comments, and repeated Chinas opposition to the arbitration case and refusal to participate. The Philippines scheme would never succeed, he told a daily news briefing in Beijing. In unusually forthright language, Botzet said Chinas policy of military buildup was not in its interest. Its investing much more in its military relative to its economic growth; its forcing its neighbors into alliances  against itself; positions its neighbors otherwise wouldnt take and the return on investment on this policy is negative, he said. The United States had exceptional military capabilities in the Asia-Pacific, Botzet said, adding that the European Union strongly supports the American guarantee of international law in Asia.

Indicted Texas mayor arrested for disrupting meeting seeking his ouster,"SAN ANTONIO (Reuters) - The mayor of the south Texas town of Crystal City, arrested earlier this month on federal corruption charges, was arrested again by his own police department for unruly behavior at a meeting that sought his resignation, police said on Wednesday. Ricardo Lopez was charged with disorderly conduct following a chaotic city council meeting on Tuesday night at which citizens presented petitions calling for the mayor, two other council members and the city manager, all of whom were also indicted, to step down. The meeting was the first since the town that bills itself as the spinach capital of the world found that most of its leaders had been indicted in the federal probe. U.S. prosecutors charged the officials with dipping into city coffers for their own personal gain. Lopez posted bail on Wednesday and left jail, telling reporters he had no intention of attending future city council meetings. Dont care who the mayor is. Dont care if Im the mayor. Im not going to another council meeting. Because I dont want to be put in jail again, he said. He did not say whether he intends to resign. Witnesses said during Tuesdays council meeting, Lopez tried to dispute calls for his resignation, yelled at spectators and left to fetch a copy of the city charter. When he returned, pushing and shoving ensued between Lopez and angry citizens, and the mayor was arrested, police said. Lopez, two other council members, and the city manager were indicted on Feb. 4. They were charged with collecting bribes from city contractors for permits and other favors and using the money to pay off gambling debts, bar tabs and car loans.  They were also suspected of allowing an illegal gambling house to operate in the town of about 7,500 people. Another Crystal City councilman was indicted in January on charges of smuggling undocumented immigrants. Crystal City is known for a quirky tourist attraction of a large statue of the spinach-eating cartoon character Popeye in front of City Hall that celebrates the areas history as a spinach producer. It holds an annual spinach festival. ",politicsNews,"February 17, 2016 ",1
"Obama to make historic trip to Cuba in coming weeks, official says","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will visit Cuba in the coming weeks, a senior administration official said on Wednesday, making a historic trip in the final year of his presidency that will mark a turning point in U.S. relations with a long-time Cold War foe. The White House plans to announce the visit on Thursday. The Cuba stop will be part of a broader trip to Latin America. The visit to Havana by Obama would cap what administration officials see as one of his legacy foreign policy achievements: normalizing relations with Cuba and taking steps toward expanded commercial relations after a 54-year freeze.  Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro shocked the world in December 2014 by announcing the former adversaries would move to normalize relations. The Republican majority in Congress has defied Obamas call to rescind the five-decade-old embargo, so he has used his executive authority to relax trade and travel restrictions. Republican presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, both sons of Cuban immigrants, have been sharply critical of his opening to Cuba in the absence of political change there. A visit by Obama to Havana in late March would correspond with the finalization of a peace deal for Colombia that was encouraged and sponsored by Castro. The Colombian government and the FARC rebel group are expected to finalize a peace deal by March 23 in Havana that would end a 50-year civil war in the South American nation. Obama said in a December interview with Yahoo News that he hoped to visit Cuba in 2016 but only if enough progress had been made in bilateral relations and he was able to meet political dissidents as part of an effort to nudge the Cuban government in a new direction.  A Cuban foreign ministry official said in reaction to the December interview that Obama was welcome to visit Cuba but not  meddle in its internal affairs. It was not immediately clear what detailed arrangements would be made for the trip or how diplomats from the two nations proposed to bridge that divide as part of the plans. Washington and Havana restored diplomatic ties in July but commerce remains limited by the U.S. trade embargo, which includes a ban on American tourism to the island. On Tuesday, American and Cuban officials signed an arrangement to restore scheduled air services between the two countries after half a century.  Rubio wasted no time in criticizing the reported plans for the trip. Asked at a CNN town hall event in South Carolina whether he would visit Cuba, Rubio replied: Not if its not a free Cuba. At the same event, Cruz also criticized Obamas move, saying he would not go to Cuba as long as the Castros are in power. What Obama has shown to our enemies is weakness and appeasement, Cruz said, lumping together Obamas steps toward improving U.S. relations with Cuba and Iran. I think its a real mistake. I think the president instead ought to be pushing for a free Cuba, he said. Instead, he will go and essentially act as an apologist. The last and only sitting U.S. president to visit Cuba was Calvin Coolidge in 1928. ",politicsNews,"February 18, 2016 ",1
Trump says Israeli-Palestinian deal may be impossible,"SUMTER, S.C. (Reuters) - Donald Trump, who has argued his experience negotiating tough real estate deals makes him best qualified to be U.S. president, said on Wednesday it might be impossible to forge a lasting peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians. During a televised town hall session hosted by MSNBC in South Carolina, Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, said he believed getting a deal done would be very, very tough. The remarks were notable not only because Trump rarely discusses Israel or the Mideast peace process on the campaign trail, but also because they seemed to show a shift in Trumps views on the feasibility of a deal.  Trump said in December he would start working on a deal between the two sides within the first six months of taking office if elected. In those earlier comments, he also said he thought a deal would be hard to make, but added he thought it depended whether the Israelis really wanted to make one.  In his comments on Wednesday, Trump said hed heard from an Israeli that the other side has been trained from the time theyre children to hate Jewish people, and that was why a deal might not work. You have one side in particular growing up and learning that these are the worst people, he said.  I would say if you can do that deal you can do any deal, he added. Thats probably the toughest deal in the world right now to make and its possible its not makeable. The town hall was part of Trumps final push to translate his substantial lead in the South Carolina polls to a victory in the states Republican primary election, which takes place on Saturday. He also appeared before South Carolina audiences on Wednesday in the towns of Bluffton, Walterboro and Sumter. Trump said hed still try to get a peace deal done, even if the odds for success were slim: Im going to give it a shot.

Illinois governor seeks broad power to balance state budget,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (Reuters) - Illinois Republican Governor Bruce Rauner on Wednesday called on Democrats who control the legislature to give him the power to balance the states chronically unbalanced budget if they continue to reject his proposed reform package. In his second budget address to the legislature, Rauner said residents were sick and tired of a political impasse that has left the fifth-largest U.S. state without a full budget for nearly eight months. Illinois and Pennsylvania are the only two states that lack complete fiscal 2016 budgets.  Rauner, a wealthy venture capitalist turned politician, offered two fiscal 2017 budget proposals: a $36.3 billion general fund spending plan that incorporates his so-called turnaround agenda that Democrats have opposed, or a budget tied to proposed legislation to empower him to reduce spending to $32.8 billion. I wont support new revenue unless we have major structural reforms to grow more jobs and get more value for taxpayers, he said. Rauner insisted any fiscal 2016 budget deal must include Democratic concessions on at least a portion of his agenda to weaken collective-bargaining rights, limit workers injured on the job from obtaining compensation from employers, freeze property taxes and change how legislative district boundaries are drawn. House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton, both Chicago Democrats, declined to support big budget powers for Rauner. What the governor is asking for is unilateral budget-making power, Madigan said, adding a balanced approach of spending cuts and new revenue is needed. Illinois has the lowest credit ratings and worst-funded pensions among the 50 states. While the search continues for a constitutional way to rein in a $111 billion unfunded pension liability, Rauner proposed saving $4.8 billion over four years by shifting some retirement costs for 1,900 high-paid employees onto their local school districts, universities and community colleges. Pension-influencing, end-of-career salary increases would face a tighter cap, while state payment spikes caused by assumption changes by the states five retirement systems would be smoothed over five years. Rauner pledged to work on a bipartisan revamp of the states school funding formula, adding any proposal involving taking money from one school district and giving it to another is doomed. He warned the Chicago Public Schools is threatening a lawsuit against the state. CPS CEO Forrest Claypool said the district, mired in its own financial crisis, is a victim of unequal funding by the state and could not ignore any tool to protect students. He added that the governor was unwilling to address that inequity. Rauner proposed boosting per-student funding in K-12 public schools to $6,119, the highest level in seven years A fiscal 2016 school funding bill passed by Democrats last year marked the only major budget measure Rauner initially signed, leaving Illinois to operate on court-ordered spending and ongoing appropriations for bonds and pensions for the fiscal year that began July 1. Spending is largely at fiscal 2015 levels when revenue was higher thanks to income tax rates that had been temporarily raised, but which rolled back on Jan. 1, 2015, making Illinois finances even shaker. Public universities and scholarships for low-income college students remain unfunded. Several hundred protesters, mostly students from public universities, crowded into the State Capitol rotunda and chanted save our schools and hey, hey, ho, ho, Governor Rauner has got to go while the governor delivered his speech inside the House chambers.  Illinois current $7.17 billion backlog of unpaid bills, a barometer of the ongoing structural budget imbalance, could be tackled partially through up to $4 billion in new borrowing that would cost less than the 12 percent penalty now tacked onto tardy state bill payments, an administration official said.

White House rebuts Supreme Court hypocrisy charge against Obama,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House tried to defuse Republican charges of hypocrisy against President Barack Obama over Supreme Court nominees on Wednesday as liberal activists swung into action and the top Senate Democrat predicted a Republican cave-in. The White House turned up the heat on the Republican-led Senate to allow fair hearings and a timely vote on Obamas impending selection to fill the court vacancy left by Saturdays death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. The Democratic presidents nominee could change the balance of power on the top U.S. court - Scalias death left it with four conservative and four liberal justices - and a monumental fight is brewing over Obamas pick for the lifetime appointment. Republicans, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have said Scalias seat should remain vacant until Obamas successor takes office next January so voters can have a say in the selection when they cast ballots in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The Senate must confirm any Supreme Court nominee. I, first of all, think that theyre going to cave in, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, speaking in Reno, Nevada, said of the Republicans. I think the presidents going to give us a nominee thats a good one, and I think theyre going to have to hold hearings and have a vote.  Obama has argued the Senate has a constitutional duty to consider his nominee. White House spokesman Josh Earnest was put on the defensive over Obamas actions a decade ago as a member of the Senate when he tried to block the nomination put forward by his predecessor in the White House, Republican George W. Bush, of conservative Samuel Alito to the nations highest court. As a first-term senator from Illinois, Obama used a procedural maneuver called a filibuster. Alito was confirmed anyway.    Some Democrats engaged in a process of throwing sand in the gears of the confirmation process. And thats an approach that the president regrets, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters.  Earnest portrayed Obamas vote to try to block Alito as symbolic and sought to contrast it to Republicans reflexive opposition to Obama nominating a justice to replace Scalia. McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said the filibuster that Obama joined undercut the White Houses argument. Liberal groups including MoveOn.org and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee said in a conference call with reporters they would mount a campaign to prod Republican senators to allow hearings and a vote on Obamas nominee. They said they already had gathered some 500,000 petition signatures opposing McConnells stance. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, who chairs the Judiciary Committee that considers high court nominees, has not ruled out holding hearings, although he has offered mixed messages about how to proceed. Grassroots voices are going to be the key to making Senator McConnell back off, Senator Chuck Schumer, a member of the Senate Democratic leadership, told reporters. Earnest declined to rule out that Obama would make a recess appointment: naming someone to the job on a temporary basis while the Senate is on a recess, bypassing the confirmation process. The White House has been in touch with the offices of multiple senators of both parties about the court vacancy, Earnest said. During a speech at Yale Law School in Connecticut, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer called for a moment of silence to honor Scalia, telling the audience: Its going to be a grayer place without him.  Earnest said Obama and first lady Michelle Obama would pay their respects to Scalia on Friday when the late justices body lies in repose at the Supreme Court building. Earnest said Obama would not go to Scalias funeral Mass on Saturday in Washington but that Vice President Joe Biden would attend. The remaining eight justices have canceled a meeting set for Friday to discuss action on future cases but are due next week to hear scheduled oral arguments in pending cases.

South Dakota governor considers transgender bathroom bill,"(Reuters) - South Dakota would be the first U.S. state to dictate what bathrooms transgender students are allowed to use in public schools if Republican Governor Dennis Daugaard signs a bill into law.  The state Senate on Tuesday voted 20-15 to send a bill to Daugaard that requires transgender pupils to use restrooms and locker rooms in public schools that correspond to their gender at birth and not the gender that fits their current identity, legislative records showed. This bill is about protecting young children who are too innocent ... to understand the complexity of life, Republican Senator David Omdahl said before voting for the bill.  Staff in Daugaards office were not immediately available for comment. Daugaard has said that he will research the issue before deciding whether to sign the legislation, local media reported.   The bill also requires schools to provide reasonable accommodations for transgender students. Those accommodations include a single-occupancy restroom, a unisex restroom, or the controlled use of a restroom, locker room or shower room.      South Dakota lawmakers are sending a message that its okay to segregate, humiliate, and bully transgender students, the American Civil Liberties Union said in an online post on the organizations website.    The passage of the bill comes two weeks after a U.S. appeals court heard arguments over whether a high school in Virginia should be ordered to allow a transgender student to use the boys bathroom, even though he was born a biological female. In December, a suburban Chicago school district reached an accord with the U.S. government over locker room access for a transgender student after the U.S. Department of Educations Office of Civil Rights found the district discriminated against the student.

Ex-White House aide and ex-IBM CEO to head cyber security panel,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former White House national security adviser Tom Donilon and former IBM chief executive Sam Palmisano will lead a new commission to strengthen U.S. cyber defenses over the next decade, the White House said on Wednesday. President Barack Obama set up the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity this month and sought $19 billion for cyber security across government in his annual budget proposal, a boost of $5 billion over the previous year. Federal agencies have worked to upgrade their security since the Office of Personnel Management announced last year that roughly 22 million personnel files had been stolen in a massive hack.

"White House holds roundtable on Puerto Rico crisis, calls for Congress to act","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials held a roundtable discussion at the White House on Tuesday about the worsening fiscal crisis in Puerto Rico, as the Obama administration continues to press Congress to act on the issue. The meeting with Puerto Rican labor leaders and business executives featured briefings from Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell, according to a White House blog post issued late on Tuesday. Lew told meeting participants that Puerto Rico has already had to take extreme emergency measures like borrowing from its pensions to stay afloat and the island will face additional strain in May and June, when more than $2 billion in debt payments come due. We simply cannot provide Puerto Rico with the tools it desperately needs to confront this crisis without congressional action, the White House said. The White House has said that Puerto Rico needs federal legislation to allow it to restructure its debts and give it independent fiscal oversight.    ",politicsNews,"February 17, 2016 ",1
Obama says ASEAN summit discussed need to lower tensions in South China Sea,"RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Tuesday he and leaders of Southeast Asian countries meeting in a California summit discussed the need to ease tensions in the South China Sea, and agreed that any territorial disputes there should be resolved peacefully and through legal means. The United States and ASEAN are reaffirming our strong commitment to a regional order where international rules and norms and the rights of all nations, large and small, are upheld, Obama said at the end of the summit with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. We discussed the need for tangible steps in the South China Sea to lower tensions including a halt to further reclamation, new construction and militarization of disputed areas, he said.

Obama scolds Senate Republicans for Supreme Court threat,"RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Tuesday vowed to pick an indisputably qualified nominee for the Supreme Court and chided Republicans who control the U.S. Senate for threatening to block him from filling the pivotal vacancy. Obama told senators he has a constitutional duty to nominate a new justice after Saturdays death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and reminded them of their constitutional obligation to do their job and vote to approve or reject his nominee. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the seat on the nations highest court should remain vacant until Obamas successor takes office in January so voters can have a say on the selection when they cast ballots in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Im amused when I hear people who claim to be strict interpreters of the Constitution suddenly reading into it a whole series of provisions that are not there, Obama said. The Constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now, Obama, a former constitutional law professor, told a news conference at the close of a two-day meeting with leaders from Southeast Asia. In Washington, Scalias chair in the courts ornate chamber was draped with black wool crepe in accordance with court tradition following a justices death. The court said Scalias body will lie in repose at the Supreme Court building on Friday before his funeral Mass at the  Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington on Saturday. Obamas nominee could shift the balance of power on the court, which had five conservatives and four liberals before Scalias death. The president said he understood the high stakes for Republican senators under pressure to vote against his pick for the lifetime appointment, who conceivably would be the deciding vote in cases where the court is split. Obama said the venom and rancor in Washington has led to the Senate routinely blocking his nominations for lower courts and other posts but said the Supreme Court is too important to get trapped in political gridlock.  Its the one court where we would expect elected officials to rise above day-to-day politics, he said. But Republicans have pointed out that Obama and members of his cabinet, who were then in the Senate, were not above trying to block the Supreme Court nomination of Justice Samuel Alito by then-President George W. Bush in 2006. While he complained about filibusters today, he joined filibusters while in the Senate, said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Asked about his record, Obama acknowledged Democrats have played politics with nominations, too, through what he described as strategic decisions that ultimately did not block the presidents nominee. But what is also true is Justice Alito is on the bench right now, Obama said. Obama shed little light on whom he would choose or how the White House will try to finesse his choice through Congress. Were going to find somebody who is an outstanding legal mind, somebody who cares deeply about our democracy and cares about rule of law, Obama said. Im going to present somebody who indisputably is qualified for the seat, and any fair-minded person, even somebody who disagrees with my politics, would say would serve with honor and integrity on the court, he added. Asked directly if that meant he would choose a moderate candidate, Obama said, No. He said there was more than enough time for the Senate to hold hearings and vote on his nominee without the White House needing to resort to a procedure known as a recess appointment to get around the Senate when it is not in session. But he did not explicitly rule out a recess appointment. Republican Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, whose panel weighs Supreme Court nominations, said on Tuesday he will wait until Obama names his pick to fill the vacancy before deciding whether to hold confirmation hearings. Grassley has offered mixed messages since Scalias death on how the Senate should proceed on the vacancy, alternating hardline views on blocking any nominee with comments not ruling out hearings.  I would wait until the nominee is made before I would make any decisions about confirmation hearings, Grassley said, according to Radio Iowa. In other words, take it a step at a time.

"Hillary Clinton, in push for black support, promises to tackle racial disparities","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton courted the critical black vote on Tuesday as she met with civil rights leaders in New York and promised in a speech to tackle very real barriers confronting African-Americans.     Clinton is seeking to maintain her lead among black voters over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, her rival for the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democrat Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president. The Clinton campaign said last week: It will be very difficult, if not impossible, for a Democrat to win the nomination without strong levels of support among African-American and Hispanic voters. Clintons status as the Democratic front-runner was jolted this month when the former secretary of state beat Sanders by less than a percentage point in Iowas caucuses and lost to him by more than 20 points in the New Hampshire primary. More than 90 percent of people in those states are white. Clinton met for more than two hours on Tuesday with a half-dozen civil rights leaders at the New York headquarters of the National Urban League. I thought that the secretary demonstrated an ease and familiarity with many of the issues we discussed this morning, National Urban League President Marc Morial said afterward. The Rev. Al Sharpton joked with Clinton in the corridors afterward, suggesting to reporters he had told her which candidate he would endorse. My lips are sealed! Clinton, who did not take any media questions, replied with a smile. At a news conference later, Sharpton said Clinton was candid and open, but he added he had yet to decide who to support and that no candidate should take the support of black voters for granted. We are not a monolithic people, he said. Clintons campaign team has argued that Sanders growing support among Democrats will likely falter as voting for a party nominee moves to more racially diverse states in the coming weeks.   Both Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have traditionally had solid support from blacks, a key component of the Democratic electorate. Opinion polls show Clinton with a strong lead over Sanders in South Carolina, where blacks are likely to make up more than half the voters in the states Democratic primary on Feb. 27. Sanders has said Clintons polling lead among blacks is partly a result of her being more famous than he is. He believes many non-white voters will be drawn to his message of fighting economic inequality as they get to know him. He is scheduled to meet with civil rights leaders in Washington on Thursday. Later on Tuesday, Clinton, a former U.S. senator from New York, gave a speech in the historically black New York City neighborhood of Harlem on breaking down the barriers that black families face. She was joined onstage before her remarks by New York Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Eric Holder, the first black U.S. attorney general. There are still very real barriers holding back African-Americans from fully participating in our economy and our society, Clinton said, citing disparities between blacks and whites in earnings, health and criminal sentencing. She said that if elected, she would spend $2 billion to encourage public school districts with a high number of troubled students to hire social workers and other experts to help young people before they get entangled in the criminal justice system. Sanders, who frequently decries the countrys high incarceration rate, also met with Sharpton earlier this month, and was endorsed by Benjamin Jealous, former president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, who said he could not support Clinton in part because of her support of the death penalty. Clinton was endorsed last week by the Congressional Black Caucus Political Action Committee, which said Clinton had a long history of working on issues that affect black Americans.

"Obama, ASEAN discuss South China Sea tensions, but no joint mention of China","RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Tuesday he and leaders of Southeast Asian countries discussed the need to ease tensions in the South China Sea, and agreed that any territorial disputes there should be resolved peacefully and through legal means. But a joint statement agreed on after a two-day summit with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations at the Sunnylands retreat in California did not include the specific mentions Washington had been seeking regarding China and its assertive pursuit of territory in the South China Sea. Obama told a news conference that leaders at the meeting reaffirmed our strong commitment to a regional order where international rules and norms and the rights of all nations, large and small, are upheld.    We discussed the need for tangible steps in the South China Sea to lower tensions including a halt to further reclamation, new construction and militarization of disputed areas, Obama said. When ASEAN speaks with a clear and unified voice, it can help advance security, opportunity and human dignity. After a first day discussing trade and economic issues with the 10 ASEAN states, U.S. officials had been hoping to arrive at a common position on the South China Sea, where China and several ASEAN states have conflicting claims. Not all ASEAN members agree, however, on how to handle the disputes, and some, such as current ASEAN chair Laos and its neighbor Cambodia, have close economic ties to China. Rather than turning a spotlight on China, the joint statement reiterated broad key principles of U.S.-ASEAN cooperation, including mutual respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, equality and political independence of all nations ... and a shared commitment to peaceful resolution of disputes. It also reaffirmed a shared commitment to maintain peace, security and stability in the region, ensuring maritime security and safety, including the rights of freedom of navigation and overflight. China claims most of the South China Sea, but ASEAN members Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Vietnam have rival claims. Fox News, citing civilian satellite imagery, reported on Tuesday that the Chinese military had deployed an advanced surface-to-air missile system to one of its contested islands in the South China Sea. The United States has criticized Chinas building of artificial islands and facilities in the sea and has sailed warships close to disputed territory to assert the right to freedom of navigation.    Beijing accused Washington of seeking maritime hegemony through such patrols. On Wednesday, Chinas Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China welcomed the U.S.-ASEAN consensus, but reiterated its opposition to Washingtons involvement in the disputed waters. Relevant countries from outside the region should not flex their military muscles in the South China Sea and should not entice regional countries to carry out joint military exercises or patrol activities targeting a third party, Hong told reporters. Obama said freedom of navigation must be upheld, and lawful commerce should not be impeded, and added the United States would continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows, and ... support the right of all countries to do the same. He also said that Washington would continue to help allies and partner countries strengthen their maritime capabilities. Obama said the two sides made progress on trade and investment and had agreed to launch a new effort to help all ASEAN nations meet the criteria of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal, of which four are so far members along with the United States. At the news conference, Obama announced an initiative, dubbed U.S.-ASEAN Connect, which he said would involve a network of hubs across the region to better coordinate economic engagement.

"Cruz tax plan would slash U.S. revenue, favor wealthy: analysis","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A tax plan proposed by Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz would cut federal revenues by $8.6 trillion over 10 years, adding substantially to the debt, according to an analysis published on Tuesday by a nonpartisan research center.  Cruz's plan, unveiled in November, would create a flat 10 percent individual income tax that with other changes would mainly benefit high-income households, the study by the Washington-based Tax Policy Center found. (tpc.io/1ToCN7M) Other changes include repealing the corporate income tax, as well as payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare, and estate and gift taxes; increasing the standard deduction and eliminating most other deductions except for mortgage interest and charity; and adding a broad-based 16 percent value-added consumption tax. The plan would cut taxes at most income levels, although the highest-income households would benefit the most and the poor the least, the Tax Policy Center said. The value-added tax proposed by Cruz, a Senator from Texas who won the Iowa caucuses among Republicans last month, would replace only 70 percent of the costs of the tax cuts, according to the center. Cruz is a favorite of the conservative Tea Party movement who helped provoke a 16-day government shutdown in September 2013 with his opposition to a spending bill. The goal was to gut the healthcare law known as Obamacare. The TPC analysis noted that high-income taxpayers would see an average tax cut in 2017 of about $6,100 or some 8.5 percent of after-tax income, while those with annual incomes over $3.7 million would see an average cut of nearly 29 percent, or more than $2 million. Households in the middle of the income distribution would receive an average tax cut of $1,800, or 3.2 percent of after-tax income, while taxpayers in the lowest quintile would receive an average tax cut of $46, or 0.4 percent of after-tax income, the TPC said. The changes would boost incentives to work, save and invest, but the lower revenue would require unprecedented cuts in government spending to avoid borrowing that would raise interest rates and discourage private investment, it said. The Tax Policy Center is a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, two Washington-based think tanks. It has issued studies of other candidates proposals.

Trump is a ------: White House hopeful plays fill-in-the-blanks with voters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump speaks volumes in what he doesnt say. The Republican presidential hopeful often fails to finish his thoughts during his speeches, abruptly breaking off a sentence or substituting a vague word for a more precise one. Those half-finished sentences arent throwaways. Theyre enthymemes, a rhetorical device at the heart of a persuasive speaking style that has helped catapult the billionaire to the top of national polls ahead of the November 2016 election. To his supporters, Trump is a politician who doesnt sound like one: He says what he thinks, happily insults rivals and can appear unscripted, particularly when he leaves his thoughts to trail off unfinished or peppers sentences with ambiguities.  Take his comments during a recent Republican debate in which he defended his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States: I talked about Muslims, he said. We have to have a temporary something, because theres something going on thats not good. It was left up to the listener to decipher what Trump was saying. What this means in practice is that supporters can tailor his statements to their own beliefs, rhetoric professors said. It also allows Trump, consciously or not, to avoid boxing himself in with quotes that rivals can use against him.  Strictly speaking an enthymeme is a form of argument in which at least one premise remains unstated. The concept isnt new - it was described by the Greek philosopher Aristotle - and has been used in American politics in the past.  In practice, enthymemes come in various forms, including dramatic pauses, unfinished sentences and the place-filling somethings Trump employs, according to the experts, who study U.S. public and political speech. In each case, listeners fill in the blanks. Trump has used enthymemes when taking on Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and one-time rival Carly Fiorina; he has used them in describing his opposition to a New York City mosque; he routinely uses them in speeches when talking about subjects ranging from immigration to trade wars. In the case of Kelly, Trump, recounting a heated exchange between them during a televised debate, said she had blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her - wherever. His statement caused a furor among many who concluded Trump had meant Kelly was menstruating and hormonal and therefore irrational. Trump denied it and supporters came to his defense, pointing out he had never spoken the words. Trumps habit of leaving listeners to fill in the blanks isnt new; its apparent in recorded interviews done well before his presidential bid. And its not clear whether he does it consciously. His spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, called it a symptom of a racing mind. People have said Mr. Trumps speeches are like a game of chess - an intricate web of great genius, she said.   Enthymemes can have a potent effect on listeners, said Baylor University rhetoric professor Martin Medhurst. You have involved them psychologically and helped to persuade them by having them persuade themselves. But the rhetorical device carries risks, especially in instances where the unfinished thought is so vague that listeners can complete it with either a positive or a negative statement. In a Jan. 29 speech, for example, Trump described his views that China is exploiting the United States. Theyve taken our jobs, theyve taken our base, theyve taken our money, and I love China, they get along great with me, I told you I have all these people, I do business with China, they agree with me. They cant . A clip of the statement was shown by Reuters to a group of students in a public policy class at New Yorks Hunter College, who disagreed among themselves about what Trumps next words would have been.  One student, Alexandre Alvalade Ximenes, a freshman studying political science and philosophy, completed Trumps unfinished thought this way: They cant believe how intellectually inferior we are.  Another, Matthew Locastro, also a political science major, filled in the blank with, Theres no way they can disagree with him because of his working relationship with them.  Trump isnt alone in using enthymemes to effect.  In an interview last September with Rolling Stone, Trump mocked the looks of Fiorina. Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?  To some listeners, Trump was communicating that he thought Fiorina was ugly. Trump later denied he meant that. Fiorina responded with her own enthymeme: I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said. ",politicsNews,"February 17, 2016 ",1
Obama says Republican campaign rhetoric troubling to outside world,"RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Tuesday he is hearing from  foreign leaders who are alarmed at Republican presidential candidates positions on issues such as climate change and immigration.     I think foreign observers are troubled by some of the rhetoric thats been taking place in these Republican primaries and Republican debates, Obama told reporters at the end of a summit with Southeast Asian leaders. Americans will choose a new president in a Nov. 8 election. Republicans and Democrats are currently battling in nominating contests to determine who will represent their parties in the race for the presidency. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has made headlines for supporting a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and controversial statements about immigrants. But Obama said the concern abroad is not limited to Trump.  He may up the ante in anti-Muslim sentiment, but if you look at what other Republican candidates have said, thats pretty troubling too, Obama added. Noting that other countries rely on the United States to back sound science, Obama also took aim at Republican resistance to strong action on climate change as troubling to the international community. Obama reiterated his confidence that ultimately Americans would reject billionaire Trump. Americans realize the next president will have access to the nuclear codes, have the power to send U.S. troops to war and may be tasked with keeping the banking system afloat, Obama said. They recognize that being president is a serious job. Its not hosting a talk show, or a reality show. Its not promotion or marketing, he said. The American people are sensible, and I think they will make a sensible choice in the end.  Trump, a real estate mogul, was host of popular reality TV shows The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice before making his run for president. Asked about Obamas comments at a town hall style event in Beaufort, South Carolina, Trump said Obama had done a lousy job and would have been a one-term president if he had decided to challenge him in the last election. This man has done such a bad job and set us back so far and for him to say that actually is a great compliment, Trump said.

New Jersey Governor Christie outlines 2017 'fiscal restraint' budget,"TRENTON, N.J. (Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie proposed a $34.8 billion fiscal 2017 state budget on Tuesday that relies on a modest 3.1 percent revenue growth and no tax hikes. It was Christies first major address to New Jerseyans since he returned home after ending his run for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination last week. He thanked residents for that great privilege. While the result was not what I had hoped for, and maybe some of you too, the experience has made me a better governor, a better American and its made me a better person, he said.   Christie spent more than half of 2015 out of state, much of it campaigning, and in a Rutgers-Eagleton Poll on Tuesday just 29 percent of registered New Jersey voters had a favorable opinion of him, his lowest level yet. Gone from Christies address was the broad national tone that dominated so many of his recent speeches. Instead he spoke, albeit briefly, about the need to fund transportation projects, a key state issue. Christies spending plan, which he said was built on fiscal restraint, included $250 million in savings from yet-to-come cost reductions in health benefits for public employees. The cost cuts could come through required use of generic drugs and increased co-pays, examples from a Treasury briefing for reporters before Christies address to lawmakers in the statehouse. Christies budget could find favor with Wall Street credit rating agencies. Since he took office in January 2010, New Jersey has been hit with nine downgrades in part because of overly optimistic revenue projections and the use of non-recurring revenue sources. The governors latest spending plan addressed both issues, with estimated revenue growth of just 3.1 percent. The proposed plan overall is just 2.2 percent larger than the $34 billion of appropriations for fiscal 2016, which ends on June 30. It also slashes reliance on one-shot revenues, to 0.7 percent of the total budget from 2.9 percent this fiscal year. The states underfunded public pension system is another sore spot for rating agencies. The governor proposed a $1.86 billion contribution in 2017, the biggest amount ever for New Jersey, but still less than half of what the state should be contributing to keep the system healthy, according to actuaries. Democrats, who control the legislature, said Christie skirted real proposals for healthcare savings or transportation funding, which they have said could be paid for with a state gasoline tax hike.

Pennsylvania attorney general facing trial will not seek re-election,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (Reuters) - Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane, who faces trial in August for allegedly leaking secret grand jury information, on Tuesday ruled out running for a second term. Kane is the first woman and first Democrat elected as the states top law enforcement officer, and her current four-year term concludes at the end of 2016. (Im) a mother first and foremost, Kane, who is divorced and has two teenage sons, told reporters at a news conference in Scranton. I have two very important people at home, said Kane, 49, of Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania. As you all know, being a single mother that in itself is a full-time job. She vigorously defended her time in office, especially her efforts to rid the state of corruption but declined to answer further questions. Tuesday marked the deadline in Pennsylvania for filing nominating petitions for the May primary election. Kane was expected to face at least two and possibly three Democratic opponents in the primary while at the same time defending herself against the legal charges.  Kane has been in legal hot water ever since her indictment last summer for allegedly passing grand jury information to a reporter as part of a personal feud. Her law license was suspended in October as a result of the grand jury indictment. Kane has portrayed herself as a victim of an old boys network worried about her efforts to expose prosecutors and Supreme Court judges who had exchanged sexually explicit or offensive emails on state computers. Last week, Democrats in the state Senate defeated a Republican-led effort to remove her from office on the grounds that her suspended law license made it impossible for her to do her job. One of her chief critics, Representative Daryl Metcalfe, a Republican, said on Tuesday he welcomed her decision not to run but also wished she had resigned. He said he would continue to support a separate effort in the House of Representatives to impeach Kane. ",politicsNews,"February 16, 2016 ",1
Republicans gear up for Supreme Court battle after Scalia's death,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates hardened their  positions on Sunday on blocking a move by President Barack Obama to fill the Supreme Court seat left by the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, a lifetime appointment that would help decide some of the most divisive issues facing Americans.  The next justice could tilt the balance of the nations highest court, which was left with four conservatives and four liberals. The vacancy quickly became an issue in the 2016 presidential race. We ought to make the 2016 election a referendum on the Supreme Court, U.S. Senator and Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said on NBCs Meet the Press. The normally nine-justice court is set to decide this year its first major abortion case in nearly a decade, as well as cases on voting rights, affirmative action and immigration. Scalia, 79, died on Saturday at a West Texas resort. The cause of death will not be determined for several days, the top official in the county where he died, Presidio County Judge Cinderela Gueara, said on Sunday in an interview with local TV station WFAA-TV. Obama, a Democrat, will nominate someone to fill the empty seat but will wait until the U.S. Senate is back in session, the White House said on Sunday. The Senate returns from recess on Feb. 22. At that point, we expect the Senate to consider that nominee, consistent with their responsibilities laid out in the United States Constitution, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. The White House declined to give a more specific timeline for Obama to announce his nominee. The nomination will set up a battle with the Republican-controlled chamber, which must approve any nominee. Shortly after news of Scalias death, Republicans vowed not to act on the vacancy until Obamas successor takes office next January. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said failure to act would be a shameful abdication of the Senates constitutional duty. Both sides said history was on their side.  Reid said it would be unprecedented to have a vacancy on the court for a year. In the modern era, the longest Supreme Court vacancy was 363 days after Abe Fortas resigned in May 1969.  Republicans cited 80 years of tradition in which no Supreme Court nominees were approved in presidential election years. In fact, Justice Anthony Kennedy was approved in 1988, after a bruising battle in which the Senate rejected President Ronald Reagans first nominee, conservative Robert Bork. Supreme Court nominations are rare, so neither side has much data to rely on in determining precedents. History is also an unreliable guide as the nomination process has become significantly more politicized in recent years. For Obamas previous two Supreme Court picks, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, he took about 30 days each to announce the elections after their predecessors, Justice John Paul Stevens and Justice David Souter, respectively, said they planned to step down. Ohio Governor John Kasich, a moderate among the Republicans vying for the White House, said the Senate should wait because a battle this year would only deepen divisions in the country. You know how polarized everything is, Kasich said on ABCs This Week. What I dont want to see is more fighting and more recrimination. Democratic U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy warned that a delay could have consequences in Novembers election, when voters get to decide who fills one-third of the Senates seats. If the Republican leadership refuses to even hold a hearing, I think that is going to guarantee they lose control of the Senate, because I dont think the American people will stand for that, he said on CNNs State of the Union.    Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said the Constitution was clear. The president makes the appointment, Senate confirms, lets get on with that business, the senator from Vermont said on Fox News Sunday. One possible contender to replace Scalia is an Indian-American appeals court judge, Sri Srinivasan, who has pro-business credentials and a stellar resume. His nomination could make it more politically challenging for Republicans to block anyone put forward by Obama. Cruz, a Texas lawmaker, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee that takes the lead on Supreme Court nominees, said the vacancy left by Scalia made the presidential election even more critical. He warned that a justice chosen by Sanders or his Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, would mean the Second Amendment right to bear arms would be written out of the Constitution and abortion on demand would become the law of the land.  Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, another White House candidate, said he would want someone who echoed Scalias originalist ideology that looks at the U.S. Constitution through the lens of its framers 18th-century intentions. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, appearing on NBC, was more direct when asked what he would want: Someone just like Justice Scalia. That would mean someone who did not let ideological differences preclude civility or even friendship, former President Bill Clinton told CNN, citing Scalias bond with liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Ginsburg, in a statement on Sunday, called her friend a jurist of captivating brilliance and wit with whom she disagreed now and then. She cited a duet sung by the two justices in the 2015 opera Scalia/Ginsburg titled: We are different, we are one. She and Scalia, Ginsburg wrote, were different in our interpretation of written texts, one in our reverence for the Constitution and the institution we serve.

Scalia's death boosts legal chances for Obama's climate plan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A vote to block the Obama administrations ambitious climate regulation was one of Antonin Scalias last acts as a Supreme Court justice. His sudden death may have opened a new path to the rules survival. Scalia died Saturday. Four days earlier, he voted with the other conservative members of the high court to put a hold on the administrations plans to implement the Clean Power Plan while it is litigated. The regulation is designed to lower carbon emissions from U.S. power plants by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels. The rule is the United States main tool to meet the emissions reduction target pledge it made at U.N. climate talks in Paris in December.  It was challenged by 27 states, along with business and industry groups, in a case now before an appeals court in Washington, D.C. The Supreme Court could be asked to weigh in again later this year. Without Scalia, the conservative members of the court no longer have a majority, at least in the short term. The sudden shift has given a boost to the supporters of the emissions rule.   Last week, the Clean Power Plan was basically dead, said Brian Potts, a lawyer with the Foley & Lardner law firm who represents companies on environmental regulatory issues. But with Scalias death, everything has changed. Environmental lawyers involved in the litigation who support the regulation told Reuters Monday that even before Scalias death they had been hopeful the Supreme Court would ultimately uphold it upon close consideration. But they said the change in the high court bolsters the rules chances. There are still no guarantees, but the Clean Power Plan faces much better odds now than it did on Friday, said Jack Lienke, a lawyer with the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University School of Law, which backs the regulation. Industry lawyers said they remained confident the regulation will be struck down. While Justice Scalias untimely passing creates more uncertainty, the Clean Power Plan is still predicated on an extraordinarily shaky legal foundation, said Scott Segal, a lawyer with the Bracewell law firm, which represents companies that oppose the regulation.  In January, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had unanimously rejected the same request for a stay that the Supreme Court granted last week. The appellate panel has set oral arguments on the merits of the case for June 2. The randomly-drawn appeals court panel is viewed by lawyers on both sides as relatively favorable for the administration, featuring two Democratic appointees and one Republican appointee. One of the Democratic appointees is Sri Srinivasan, a judge many legal experts see as a leading candidate for President Barack Obama to nominate to replace Scalia. If the appeals court upholds the rule and the challengers take the case to the Supreme Court, they would face an uphill battle in getting the five votes needed for a win without Scalia. The four liberal justices are seen as likely to uphold the rule. So, the best result the challengers would be likely to get is a 4-4 split. When the court is evenly divided, the lower court ruling stands, meaning the regulation would survive. An unknown factor is how soon a ninth member will be appointed and whether it will be a Democratic or Republican president who makes it. Some Republican leaders have said Obama should not appoint a successor, leaving it to the next president, who would take office in January 2017. Obama has said he plans to announce a nomination but will face an uphill ban to win confirmation in the Republican-controlled Senate. If a Democratic appointee replaces Scalia, it would tilt the balance of the court leftward for the first time in decades. A Republican appointee would extend the narrow conservative tilt the bench had until Scalias death. If Srinivasan were appointed, he would have to step aside on the Clean Power Plan case because of his involvement in the case at the appellate level. That would increase the chances of a 4-4 split.

Republican presidential candidate Cruz proposes military boost,"(Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz pledged on Tuesday to boost the size of the U.S. armed forces and invest in new airplanes and ships, as he seeks to push back in military-focused South Carolina against rivals criticism of his defense record. Cruz, speaking at a decommissioned aircraft carrier in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, said that if he won the White House he would establish a total active-duty force of 1.4 million people, prioritize constructing new ballistic missile submarines and invest in anti-missile systems. If you think its too expensive to defend this nation, try not defending it, the U.S. senator from Texas said in a speech unveiling his proposal. Republicans seeking the party nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election are emphasizing defense issues in South Carolina. The state, home to a number of military bases and retired veterans, holds its Republican primary on Saturday.  Cruz has taken heat from rivals for voting for bills limiting defense spending and for pushing to revamp domestic surveillance programs. He has also argued for scaled-back military involvement overseas, saying the United States should protect its interests but not engage in nation-building. Cruzs Republican opponents have touted their own plans to boost the size of the U.S. military. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has called for the Army to be staffed at 490,000 people, compared to Cruzs proposal Tuesday of 525,000 soldiers.

"Foreclosure crisis snarls Clinton, Sanders' efforts to reach Nevada voters","(Reuters) - Democratic presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are flooding Nevada with volunteers ahead of this weeks key nominating contest but they face a problem - the addresses, phone numbers and other personal data they need to reach many voters are out of date. Nevada, which is more than a quarter Latino, was one of the states worst affected by the 2008 financial meltdown, with hundreds of thousands of families unable to pay their mortgages and forced to move in a crisis that by some estimates hit minorities twice as hard as whites.  With the foreclosed homes often switching hands multiple times - from homeowner to bank to investor and back to another homeowner in just a few years - keeping up with voters who at some point lived in those homes is difficult.  (For a graphic, click here: tmsnrt.rs/20OgmO4 ) The Nevada Democratic caucus on Feb. 20 has emerged as an unusually important test of Sanders and Clintons political strength. Clinton is under pressure to keep her wide lead among Latinos, while Sanders must erode it to show he has a path to the nomination that does not rely mainly on the young white voters who make up the core of his support base. This ongoing (foreclosure) crisis makes reaching potential voters more difficult, Sanders campaign said in a statement emailed to Reuters. The Clinton campaign said the voter lists supplied by the Democratic Party needed significantly more work to update, forcing them to spend valuable canvassing time building up their own private data. Las Vegas, Nevadas biggest city, has seen some of the countrys highest foreclosure rates since 2008, hitting No. 1 among more than 200 U.S. metro areas from 2009 to 2011, according to RealtyTrac, a provider of real estate data and analytics. Even now, the city and its surrounding area rank No. 17. Data that might have been corrected in the 2012 general election has, in many cases, already fallen out of date again because the Nevada housing market has continued to see wave after wave of foreclosures, the campaigns said. The Democratic partys voter file is based primarily on voter registration records across the country. But the time between when a person moves and when their voter registration file gets updated can vary because different states and counties have different rules about how to handle those changes, which are not automatic. Not just our modeling and turnout operation but our recruitment operation is based on having very clean data, said Jorge Neri, Clintons Nevada organizing director. Underscoring the problem, about a fifth of the 1 million voters registered in Clark County, where Las Vegas is located, are tagged as inactive, according to Joseph Gloria, the countys registrar of voters - meaning their mail has been returned to the county elections office as undeliverable.  Latinos make up almost 32 percent of Las Vegas.      Personal information on voters forms the lifeblood of modern election campaigns. It can be used for just about every aspect of a ground operation - from building the so-called turf packets that volunteers scoop up to go knock on doors, to guiding the thousands of phone calls made by volunteers.  Campaign strategy is often based on the voter file, which can tell a campaign everything from where they need to turn up more supporters to what areas they can consider strongholds  or weak points. Clinton staffers first arrived in Nevada last April, campaign officials said, targeting the state early because it has the third nominating contest in the presidential race for the Democrats.  But because so much of the file was out of date, the Clinton campaign had to work harder just to find voters and make sure their information was correct. Door knocking, for example, was often much more time consuming: People listed at certain addresses might have moved, requiring volunteers to engage with new residents from scratch and, perhaps, find out where the previous occupants had gone. That brand-new information, in turn, created more work as volunteers were forced to spend time inputting the new information into the campaigns own database.  The problem complicated normal operations, Neri said. Had we had cleaner lists, had we had not such a transient population, we would be focused more on the volunteer recruitment, he said.  The Sanders campaign is also knocking on doors and phone banking, said Joan Kato, the state director. But, she added, the campaign was using community outreach efforts too, such as house parties and speaking to student groups, to gather data from attendees. Kato did not say how much extra work the voter file problem had created for the campaign. Latinos make up about 27 percent of Nevadas population and they lean heavily Democrat, meaning they are a prize voter bloc for Clinton and Sanders.  There hasnt been enough polling in Nevada recently to show who is ahead among Latinos. But nationally Clinton has the advantage: Among Latinos who describe themselves as Democrats, 54 percent support Clinton and 37 percent back Sanders, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling from Oct. 1 to Feb. 12. Latino Decisions, a polling and research firm, said Latinos are expected to form up to 20 percent of the voters in Nevada this year up from 8.4 percent in 2012, as tallied by Pew Research Center. The importance of a good voter file cant be underestimated, according to Ethan Roeder, who was President Barack Obamas data director in the 2008 and 2012 elections. You can run a campaign without a voter file. You just cant run a successful campaign, he said.

Supreme Court fight gives Democrats fuel to regain U.S. Senate control," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Supreme Court nomination battle that was ignited on Saturday with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia has given Democrats an explosive new issue that could bolster their chances of regaining majority control of the U.S. Senate.  The impact could be felt most acutely in swing states, where Republicans are trying to hold onto Senate seats, political strategists and analysts said. The high stakes are also expected to prompt greater voter turnout that could favor Democrats.ALSO ONREUTERS Trump is a ------: White House hopeful plays fill-in-the-blanks with voters Not in my backyard? Mainstream Scandinavia warily eyes record immigration With no clear idea of who President Barack Obama will nominate as Scalias replacement, it was way too early to know exactly how this fight will play out in already rollicking presidential and congressional elections.  But, in this hyper-polarized political environment we are currently operating in, I can only assume the battle over this (court) nominee will dominate the political debate from here on out, said Jim Manley, a strategist and former top aide to Democratic senators.  Manley noted Republicans are facing tough races for Senate seats in swing states such as Ohio, Florida, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and could find themselves in even tighter spots because of the divisive fight over Scalias replacement.  These Republican candidates, who either already serve in the Senate or are vying for open seats, have to especially thread the needle in their politically divided states on social issues, like abortion rights, that so dominate Supreme Court confirmation fights.  Democrats already enjoyed an advantage in the November Senate elections, having to defend only 10 seats while 24 Republican seats are up for grabs in the 100-member chamber.  Democrats need a net gain of five seats to win back the majority they lost in the 2014 elections.  Just hours after Scalias death at the age of 79, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell proclaimed that whoever moves into the White House on Jan. 20, 2017 - and not Obama - should pick the replacement for the late conservative jurist.  The Senate must confirm presidential nominees to the life-time appointments at the nine-justice high court, whose recent decisions have had a deep impact on the country, from the legalization of same-sex marriage to election campaign finance.  If the Republican leadership refuses to even hold a hearing, I think that is going to guarantee they lose control of the Senate, because I dont think the American people will stand for that, proclaimed Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, who was interviewed on CNNs State of the Union on Sunday.  Meanwhile, McConnells announcement sparked new fundraising pleas in the presidential and congressional campaigns, which already were awash in campaign contributions.  Ron Bonjean, a former top Republican Senate leadership aide and current political strategist, acknowledged that Republican Senate candidates from swing states may be placed in an awkward position by the Supreme Court fight.  While some may be pressured to join Democrats in calling for a confirmation vote depending on who Obama nominates, Bonjean also saw a potential upside for those Republicans.  With anti-establishment candidates like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders far exceeding expectations in their quest for the presidency, Republican Senate candidates in swing states could feel emboldened to break from party ranks.  Senator Mark Kirk in Illinois, for example, is one of those Republicans in a swing state facing a potentially rough race.  The 2016 campaigns already were generating an avalanche of voter interest with control of the White House and Congress hanging in the balance.  Now, with the ideological control of the Supreme Court also to be decided, That leads to only one conclusion: Increased turnout of voters in November, said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist.  Higher turnout often helps Democratic presidential candidates, which in turn could help Democratic Senate candidates.  However, Sabato also noted that with the Supreme Court vacancy ascending in importance, it could rally establishment Republicans who currently oppose the anti-establishment Trump to support him if he becomes the partys nominee.  And that, in turn, could boost Republican turnout in tight Senate races.  ",politicsNews,"February 15, 2016 ",1
Vietnam PM wants stronger U.S. role in South China Sea,"HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnams prime minister has urged a greater U.S. role in preventing militarization and island-building in the South China Sea, the government said on Tuesday, in a rare call for Washingtons support to curb Beijings maritime expansionism. During a summit of Southeast Asian countries in California on Monday, premier Nguyen Tan Dung suggested to U.S. President Barack Obama that Washington uses a stronger voice and more practical and more efficient actions, in comments likely to rile China. Tension has spiked since Beijings construction of seven islands in the Spratly archipelago. Prime Minister Dung suggested the United States has a stronger voice and more practical and more efficient actions requesting termination of all activities changing the status quo, the government said on its news website. The statement did not specifically name China, but it said Dung was referring especially to large-scale construction of artificial islands and militarization. With a large U-shaped line on its official maps, China claims most of the South China Sea. Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei and Vietnam have rival claims. Obama and allies from Southeast Asia will turn their attention to China on Tuesday on the second day of a summit intended to improve trade and provide a united front on maritime disputes with Beijing. Whereas China accuses the United States of seeking maritime hegemony in Asia, Washington says its interest in the South China Sea is preserving freedom of navigation. In recent months, the United States raised the stakes by sending guided-missile destroyers USS Lassen and USS Curtis Wilbur close to disputed areas occupied by Beijing.    Though communist Vietnam routinely opposes Chinas activities in disputed waters, its leaders are usually wary of provoking a giant neighbor with which it shares over $60 billion of annual trade and maintains close ideological ties. Dung has earned popularity in Vietnam for pursuing stronger U.S. trade and defense links and for taking a tougher line against China, compared to measured responses by other Vietnamese leaders to Beijings assertiveness. Dung was controversially overlooked by the politburo last month in its nomination for party chief, meaning the end of his political career when his term ends this year, posing a possible blow for Washington. Dung also asked Obama to fully lift a lethal arms embargo on Vietnam, which would be an important way to strengthen political trust, the government website quoted him saying. Obama will visit Vietnam in May, the White House said. ",politicsNews,"February 16, 2016 ",1
Jeb Bush gets a brotherly hand from George W. in South Carolina,"CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Former President George W. Bush came to the aid of his brother Jeb Bushs Republican presidential campaign in South Carolina on Monday with a rousing endorsement of his character and a call for voters to reject the angry bluster of Donald Trump. The appearance of the elder Bush on the campaign trail may help Jeb Bush with South Carolina Republicans who hold the former president in high regard. But it also carries some risks, given his launching of the Iraq war in 2003, which ended up being unpopular with many Americans and which Republican front-runner Trump has seized on to criticize him. George W. Bush, who has stayed out of politics for the most part since leaving office in early 2009, showed he remains an engaging speaker, generating cheers repeatedly over 20 minutes from the biggest crowd Jeb Bush has enjoyed in his campaign. Without mentioning Trump by name, the 69-year-old George W. Bush left no doubt he was talking about the New York billionaire who uses incendiary rhetoric at his campaign events. These are tough times and I know that Americans are angry, but we do not need someone in the Oval Office who mirrors and inflames our anger and our frustrations, the former president said.  Real strength, he said, means facing challenges and prevailing. Strength is not empty rhetoric. It is not bluster. It is not theatrics. Real strength comes from integrity and character. And in my experience, the strongest person isnt usually the loudest person in the room, George W. Bush said. Whether the elder Bushs presence will help his 63-year-old brother in the South Carolina Republican primary on Saturday remains to be seen. Jeb is running fourth in polls in South Carolina, behind Trump, Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Trump, at a news conference in Charleston earlier in the day, continued a stream of insults directed at the Bush family, insisting that the former president bore responsibility for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that took place on his watch. Excuse me, the World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush, right? It came down. That was the greatest attack in the history of the United States  worse than Pearl Harbor.... We werent safe, Trump said. George W. Bush offered some vivid imagery of what took place on Sept. 11 without addressing Trumps criticism and saluted U.S. military personnel, a key constituency in South Carolina.  In his first public campaign appearance of the year for his brother, George W. Bush also met privately with South Carolinas Republican governor, Nikki Haley, who has yet to endorse a candidate for the primary vote.  George W. Bushs standing has risen among all Americans since he left power in 2009 and he has stayed on the sidelines of his brothers presidential bid, headlining private fundraisers but otherwise staying off the campaign trail. That he is getting out in public now shows the urgency Jeb Bush sees in a good performance in South Carolina. Bush finished in sixth place in the Iowa caucuses and in fourth place in the New Hampshire primary - the first contests in the state-by-state battles to pick a party nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Jeb Bush predicted a good showing on Saturday, telling the crowd that Saturday is going to be a surprise. Trump is also keeping an eye on Cruz and trying to prevent him from gaining ground on him. He issued a statement accusing Cruz of dirty politics for running a negative ad against him. Trump also threatened to sue Cruz to determine whether he can legally serve as president since he was born in Canada and therefore might not meet the requirements set out in the U.S. Constitution. One of the ways I can fight back is to bring a lawsuit against him, Trump said.

Israeli kibbutz can 'feel the Bern' of forgotten volunteer Sanders ,"KIBBUTZ SHAAR HAAMAKIM, Israel (Reuters) - An Israeli kibbutz is taking considerable pride in a former volunteer, U.S. Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, even though no one on the communal farm can quite remember him. In 1990 Sanders, then running for Congress, told Israels Haaretz newspaper he had volunteered for several months as a young man at Kibbutz Shaar Haamakim, a community with deep socialist roots on the edge of the Biblical Jezreel Valley in northern Israel. Sanders, 74, has mentioned in the past that he once worked on a kibbutz, but its name remained a mystery until Haaretz republished its interview with him earlier this month. There are no records at Shaar Haamakim of Sanders stint in 1963 and none of its veteran members can say for sure they ever met him. That hasnt stopped journalists from streaming into the community to try to dig for details about Sanders experience at the kibbutz, where the Brooklyn-born Vermont senator, who is Jewish, is now the talk of the farm. The fact that Bernie Sanders name was linked with Kibbutz Shaar Haamakim is a big honor for the kibbutz, said its chairman Yair Merom.  The values that Bernie Sanders speaks about and his ideology in the presidential race - the modern social democratic values - are incredibly compatible with Kibbutz Shaar Haamakim. Kibbutz elder Albert Ely, 79, told Reuters he couldnt put a face to the name but he remembered that an American called Bernard had once been a volunteer. Everybody mentions it. Now that the election campaign began, there is great happiness in the entire kibbutz, said Gilad Hershkikovich, who tends to its cows. Im sure he had a good time here.

"Obama, Southeast Asia leaders eye China and trade at California summit","RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama gathered with leaders from Southeast Asia on Monday to strengthen trade ties and form a common stance over the South China Sea in a summit that the White House hopes will solidify U.S. influence in the region. Obama, who leaves office next year, has championed a  foreign policy pivot to Asia during his presidency and is determined to present the United States as a Pacific power. His meeting with leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was aimed at cementing that legacy. This reflects my personal commitment, and the national commitment of the United States, to a strong and enduring partnership with your 10 nations, he said at the start of the two-day summit at Sunnylands, a California resort. The meeting, at the same location where Obama once hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping, was designed to demonstrate Washingtons role as a counterweight to Beijing and as an eager trading partner with ASEAN members. White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice told reporters U.S. companies had more than doubled investment in the region since 2008. On Monday the leaders were slated to focus on economic issues, including discussion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, which includes four ASEAN members: Vietnam, Singapore, Brunei and Malaysia. Others are interested in joining, and the White House wants to make sure the pact takes effect. On Tuesday, the leaders will discuss maritime issues, particularly the South China Sea, where China and several Southeast Asian states have conflicting and overlapping claims. White House officials have said Obama would deliver a tough message to China that disputes over the South China Sea must be resolved peacefully and not by bullying. Here at this summit, we can advance our shared vision of a regional order where international rules and norms, including freedom of navigation, are upheld and where disputes are resolved through peaceful, legal means, Obama said. The challenge may be to get all ASEAN countries to agree on a strong statement on the issue. Officials say China has put pressure on countries such as Cambodia and Laos not to sign. Im ... confident that our shared commitment to upholding these norms will be reinforced, Rice said. Chinas role in the region hung over the meeting. Rice said she expected China would support new international sanctions on North Korea for its recent rocket launches.  An editorial in the influential Chinese tabloid the Global Times on Tuesday said the summit was the wrong place to discuss South China Sea issues and that it would not yield striking geopolitical decisions.  ASEAN countries have no such desire, and the U.S. knows it is not able to do so, the Global Times said, repeating Beijings stance that disputes in the sea should be handled bilaterally. Advocacy group Human Rights Watch urged the Obama administration to object to human rights violations in countries such as Cambodia and Thailand during the summit. The president touched on the issue without specifics during his remarks. Here at the summit, we can reaffirm that strong, prosperous and inclusive societies require good governance, rule of law, accountable institutions, vibrant civil societies and upholding human rights, he said. Combating climate change and cooperating on counter-terrorism and the fight against Islamic State militants were also on the agenda.  Obama returns to Washington on Tuesday.

Obama starts work to pick Supreme Court justice amid political 'bluster',"RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama has held preliminary discussions with his team about whom to nominate to the Supreme Court, the White House said on Monday, while accusing Senate Republicans of bluster for saying they would not confirm his pick. White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters administration officials had started talking with Senate offices about the process, which is shaping up to be an epic fight between Republicans and Democrats in a presidential election year. Republicans, who control the Senate, say Obama should put off naming a replacement for conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died over the weekend, and leave it to the next president to decide. Democrats say it is the presidents responsibility and right to make the choice. Americans will choose a new president in the Nov. 8 elections. Obama leaves office in January 2017. Scalias death leaves the court evenly divided between liberal and conservative justices just as it is set to decide major cases on abortion, voting rights and immigration. A growing number of Republican senators have already said they will not support an Obama nominee, including a dozen who are up for reelection in November. On Monday, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio each announced their opposition. Both are up for reelection this year. This is not the first time that Republicans have come out with a lot of bluster, only to have reality ultimately sink in, Schultz said, citing recent spats over raising the U.S. debt limit and approving a nuclear deal with Iran. At each pass, they took a hard line. They tried to play politics. But ultimately, they were not able to back up their threats, Schultz said. Republicans shrugged off the criticism, pointing to past political battles over Supreme Court nominees. In 2006, Democratic leaders in the Senate, as well as then-Senator Obama, tried but failed to block President George W. Bushs nomination of Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court, noted Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Memories tend to be short around here sometimes, he said. Obama, in California for a long-planned summit with Southeast Asian leaders, will return to Washington on Tuesday after a press conference at which he is sure to face questions about his strategy for filling the Supreme Court vacancy. David Axelrod, a former adviser to the president, said the  White House should not make an overtly political pick while Republicans were behaving in a such a political manner themselves.  To me, it makes sense to nominate one of the stellar judges hes already chosen who has been approved by this same Senate that now refuses to act, Axelrod said. One possible contender is Sri Srinivasan, who Republican senators supported in 2013 when he was confirmed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Schultz declined to speculate on names or strategy.  Obama will look for a nominee with impeccable credentials who believes in adherence to precedent and bringing ones own ethics and moral bearings to decisions on the court in which the law is not clear, he said. The president seeks judges who understand that justice is not about some abstract legal theory, or a footnote in a casebook, but it is also about how our laws affect the daily realities of peoples lives, Schultz said. Leaving the vacancy unfilled could affect the court both this year and next, Schultz said, calling on the Senate to act. The Constitution does not include exemptions for election years or for the presidents last term in office. Theres no exemptions for when a vacancy could tip the balance of the court, he said.

"Obama: U.S., Southeast Asia can advance 'shared vision' on maritime disputes","RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Monday that the United States and Southeast Asian nations can advance a shared vision of rules and norms for resolving maritime disputes peacefully. Obama made the reference to the South China Sea, where China and several Southeast Asian states have conflicting and overlapping claims, at the beginning of a summit with leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

Trump vows to sue Cruz over birthplace if 'false ads' stay up,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump blasted close rival Ted Cruz on Monday, threatening to file a lawsuit challenging his eligibility for the White House if the Texas senator does not take down his false ads. The New York billionaire, whose campaign has long been littered with insults, called Cruz totally unstable and said he is the single biggest liar Ive ever come across, in politics or otherwise, and I have seen some of the best of them. Speaking at a news conference in South Carolina, Trump said     he could fight back by bringing a lawsuit against Cruz over the fact that he was born in Canada, which Trump argues makes him ineligible to become president.  If he doesnt take down his false ads and retract his lies, I will do so immediately, he said. Cruz scored a key early victory in the Republican race to pick a nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election when he won the Iowa caucuses earlier this month, and has been attacking Trump on a range of issues.  Trump said the Republican National Committee should intervene to stop Cruz from misrepresenting his views and policies on issues such as abortion, gun rights, healthcare and potential Supreme Court nominees. He said he had signed a pledge with the RNC agreeing not to run a third-party candidacy, and to support the eventual Republican nominee, and the RNC should do its bit to keep the campaign fair. The bottom line is the RNC is controlled by the establishment ... and special interests, Trump told reporters. I signed a pledge, but its a double-edged pledge. As far as Im concerned, theyre in default on their pledge. Trumps remarks, days ahead of Saturdays Republican primary in South Carolina, came after increasingly bitter exchanges between the two candidates in recent weeks. Cruz has hammered Trump on key issues, and said on Saturday that if elected he would appoint liberals to the Supreme Court. Trump has long said that Cruz may not be constitutionally qualified to serve as president because he was born in Canada. The U.S. Constitution says only natural born citizens can become president of the United States. Born in Calgary, Alberta, to a U.S. citizen mother and a Cuban father, Cruz has accused Trump of bringing up his birthplace simply because Cruz is leading some polls. Last month, Cruz said Trump, who led the movement questioning whether the Hawaiian-born President Barack Obama was really from the United States, had asked his lawyers to look into the issue of Cruzs birth in September and concluded there were no issues.

Asian-American judges among Obama's options as he seeks to replace Scalia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama has a number of likely options as he looks for a nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Saturday. Within a few hours, Obama said he intends to make a nomination, despite Republicans stressing they opposed any appointment being made until after Novembers presidential election. The Republican-controlled U.S. Senate would have to approve the nomination. If Obamas nominee is not confirmed by the Senate, the White House could use the process to energize Democratic voters ahead of the presidential and congressional elections in November. If a Democratic nominee were to replace Scalia it would lead to a sizable shift in the ideological balance of the high court, which has had a conservative majority for decades. Here are some of the possibilities, including two prominent Asian-American judges: Sri Srinivasan Among those the administration could turn to is Sri Srinivasan, 48, who has served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since May 2013. He would be the first Indian-American on the court and has impeccable bipartisan credentials. The Senate confirmed him on a 97-0 vote three years ago. He was a law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day OConnor, now retired, a 1981 appointee of Republican President Ronald Reagan. At Srinivasans confirmation hearing, Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, now a presidential candidate, described himself as a long-standing friend dating back to their time together as law clerks in the U.S. appeals court based in Richmond, Virginia. Cruz said Srinivasan had done a very fine job in answering the committees questions. During his nomination to the appeals court, prominent Republicans such as former U.S. Solicitor General Ted Olson supported Srinivasan. At his 2013 investiture, leading lights of the legal establishment from both parties praised him. Federal appeals court judge J. Harvie Wilkinson, a Reagan appointee for whom Srinivasan was also a law clerk, called him lightning smart. So far on the appeals court, his rulings have not sparked controversy. Jacqueline Nguyen Other names the administration could consider include Jacqueline Nguyen, 50, a Vietnamese-American who has been a judge on the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals since May 2012. The first Asian-American woman to sit on a federal appeals court, she was confirmed by the Senate in 2012 by a 91-3 vote. When she was a child, Nguyen fled South Vietnam with her family toward the close of the Vietnam War in 1975, and then lived in a refugee camp in California. Nguyen was a federal prosecutor and district court judge in Los Angeles before she was elevated to the appeals court. Paul Watford An African-American who is also a judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Paul Watford is another possibility. He was an appellate litigator at the Munger, Tolles & Olson law firm before Obama nominated him to the appeals court in 2011. Watford, 48, clerked for 9th Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski, a libertarian-leaning Republican, and for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of Scalias colleagues on the Supreme Court.  He was confirmed by a 61-34 vote, as some Republicans raised concerns about Watfords work as a lawyer on immigration and death penalty cases. Jane Kelly Jane Kelly, a white woman and former public defender who has served on the St. Louis, Missouri-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals since April 2013. She was supported by Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the key committee that would review the nominee.  Kelly, 51, clerked for now-retired Judge David Hansen, a friend of Grassleys who served on the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. She was confirmed by the Senate on a 96-0 vote.

Obama to nominate Supreme Court justice when Senate returns: White House,"RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will not rush through a Supreme Court choice to replace Justice Antonin Scalia this week but will wait to nominate a candidate until the U.S. Senate is back in session, the White House said on Sunday. Given that the Senate is currently in recess, we dont expect the president to rush this through this week, but instead will do so in due time once the Senate returns from their recess, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. At that point, we expect the Senate to consider that nominee, consistent with their responsibilities laid out in the United States Constitution, he said. Obama is traveling in California and returns to Washington on Tuesday. The Senate returns from recess on Feb. 22. Making a recess appointment would have been extremely controversial.  The White House declined to give a more specific timeline for Obama to announce his nominee.  For his previous two Supreme Court picks, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, the president took about 30 days each to announce his selection after their predecessors, Justice John Paul Stevens and Justice David Souter, respectively, said they planned to step down. In remarks honoring Scalia on Saturday, Obama made clear he would not succumb to pressure from Republicans to leave the selection of a new justice to his successor.  The president, who leaves office in January 2017, said he would make his choice in due time. These are responsibilities that I take seriously, as should everyone. Theyre bigger than any one party. They are about our democracy, he said. Theyre about the institution to which Justice Scalia dedicated his professional life, and making sure it continues to function as the beacon of justice that our founders envisioned. Scalias death and the upcoming fight over his replacement gives the White House an unexpected shot at shifting the balance of power on the Supreme Court in what would be a legacy-defining  act during his last year in office. It also keeps the president from slipping quickly into lame duck status during an election year. White House officials are unlikely to drag out the process of announcing Obamas choice. They should move with dispatch, said David Axelrod, Obamas former senior adviser. To rebut Republican arguments, the White House points to a host of previous Supreme Court nominees who have received speedy hearings and votes regardless of which party had control in Congress.

Senator McCain says could subpoena U.S. sailors held by Iran,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Senator John McCain said on Sunday he would subpoena 10 U.S. sailors to testify about their brief detention by Iran if the Obama administration does not provide the findings of an investigation into the incident byMarch 1. Its an option that I do not want to exercise, McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters as he was returning to the United States from an international security conference in Germany. The sailors were detained by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps after their two patrol boats strayed into Iranian waters on Jan. 12. U.S. officials later blamed a navigational problem. The Americans were freed the next day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry intervened with Iranian Foreign Minister JavadZarif, averting a diplomatic crisis just days before implementation of the Iran nuclear deal and the lifting of international sanctions on Tehran. Iranian media broadcast videos of the detainees, including scenes in which Revolutionary Guards personnel trained weapons on the sailors as they kneeled. The Obama administration has said the sailors speedy release showed the power of diplomacy and the promise of its new engagement with Iran. The U.S. Navy had briefed McCain several times about the incident, and would continue to do so as the investigation proceeded, said one U.S. official. Republicans have been critical of the deal with Iran, and some say the detainment of the sailors showed how little regard Iran had for the United States. McCain said he had been told the sailors were still being debriefed, but addedthat he assumed that administration members were dragging their feet in completing an investigation into the incident, which he accused Iran of exploiting for propaganda purposes.   I guarantee you, if they dont have a debrief by the first of March like they said, well have a hearing and well subpoena. Were not going to wait any longer, McCain said. We will subpoena the individuals if we have to. McCain said he raised the case in a meeting on Saturday with Kerry on the sidelines of the security conference in Munich.

Indian-American judge who could replace Scalia worked on controversial cases for business,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One possible contender to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court is an Indian-American appeals court judge, Sri Srinivasan, who has pro-business credentials and a stellar resume. If he was nominated his background may make it more politically challenging for Republicans as they plan to block anyone put forward by President Barack Obama. Srinivasan, 48, has served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since he was confirmed on a 97-0 bipartisan vote in the U.S. Senate in May 2013. Republican senators who supported him then would likely be asked to justify why they couldnt back him for the Supreme Court.  Many names are likely under consideration and the White House has not tipped its hand, but recent Supreme Court appointments have tended to be appeals court judges and the appeals court in Washington on which Srinivasan serves has often been a springboard to the high court. Scalia himself served on the court, as did other Supreme Court members Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  The White House said on Sunday that Obama will wait until the U.S. Senate is back in session before making a nomination. The Senate returns from recess on Feb. 22. Republicans have called for Scalias seat to remain open so that the next president, who would take office in January 2017, can nominate a replacement. Other judges Obama could consider appointing include Paul Watford, a black man who serves on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and Jacqueline Nguyen, a Vietnamese-American woman who serves on the same court as Watford. Little is known about Srinivasans views on divisive social issues like abortion and affirmative action. But as a senior Justice Department lawyer in 2013, he was part of the legal team that successfully urged the high court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act, a law that restricted the definition of marriage to heterosexual couples for the purposes of federal benefits. The ruling helped pave the way for the courts ruling in June 2015 that legalized gay marriage nationwide. Srinivasan could not be reached for comment. In private practice, prior to his appointment to the appeals court, Srinivasan successfully represented former Enron Corp CEO Jeff Skilling in a Supreme Court case. The Supreme Court narrowed the reach of the so-called honest services fraud law, invalidating one theory used by prosecutors for Skillings conspiracy conviction and ordering further appeals court review. Despite the high court ruling, Skillings conviction was later upheld by an appeals court. Srinivasan also represented Exxon Mobil Corp in a lawsuit alleging human rights abuses in Indonesia, and mining giant Rio Tinto in a similar case about its activities in Papua New Guinea. Both cases concerned in part whether a law called the Alien Tort Statute allows such cases to be heard in U.S. courts. The Exxon case is still ongoing. The Rio Tinto lawsuit was dismissed. His work during two stints with the OMelveny and Myers law firm prompted expressions of concern from liberal groups and unions that normally back Democratic judicial nominations when he was nominated to the appeals court in 2012. He has had a lengthy career in public service, serving in the Justice Department during both the Obama and George W. Bush administrations. Under Bush he had a junior role, while under Obama he was a political appointee serving as the top deputy to the solicitor general. Srinivasan was born in Chandigarh, India and grew up in Lawrence, Kansas, where his father was a professor at the University of Kansas. If appointed, he would be the first Indian-American to serve on the Supreme Court. He played basketball in high school and then attended Stanford for undergraduate, business and law degrees, yet never lost his allegiance to the University of Kansas Jayhawks. That was a theme of the judicial dignitaries that saluted him at his 2013 investiture for the appeals court, as was the fact that when he was an advocate before the Supreme Court, he carried in his pockets for good luck the socks his twin son and daughter wore when they were newborns. Srinivasans bipartisan credentials are lengthy. He was a law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day OConnor, now retired, a 1981 appointee of Republican President Ronald Reagan. At Srinivasans confirmation hearing, he was backed by conservative Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who is now running for president. We have been friends a long time, so I am hopeful that our friendship will not be seen as a strike against you by some, Cruz, who is known for having tense relationships with Senate colleagues, joked at the time. A spokesman for Cruz said the senator would not be commenting on any possible Obama nominee, reaffirming that Cruz believes the nomination should be left to the next U.S. president.

Reaction to death of U.S. Justice Scalia,"(Reuters) - Conservative U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has died, setting up a major political showdown between President Barack Obama and the Republican-controlled Senate over who will replace the jurist just months before a presidential election. Following is reaction to Scalias death. For almost 30 years, Justice Antonin Nino Scalia was a larger-than-life presence on the bench, a brilliant legal mind with an energetic style, an incisive wit and colorful opinions. I plan to fulfill my constitutional responsibilities to nominate a successor in due time. There will be plenty of time for me to do so and for the Senate to fulfill its responsibility to give that person a fair hearing and a timely vote. These are responsibilities that I take seriously, as should everyone. Theyre bigger than any one party. They are about our democracy. Theyre about the institution to which Justice Scalia dedicated his professional life and making sure it continues to function as the beacon of justice that our founders envisioned. He was a towering figure and important judge on our nations highest court. He brought intellect, good judgment, and wit to the bench, and he will be missed by his colleagues and our country. He was an extraordinary individual and jurist, admired and treasured by his colleagues.His passing is a great loss to the Court and the country he so loyally served. The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president. The president can and should send the Senate a nominee right away. With so many important issues pending before the Supreme Court, the Senate has a responsibility to fill vacancies as soon as possible. It would be unprecedented in recent history for the Supreme Court to go a year with a vacant seat. Failing to fill this vacancy would be a shameful abdication of one of the Senates most essential Constitutional responsibilities. REPUBLICAN SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN Given the huge divide in the country, and the fact that this president, above all others, has made no bones about his goal to use the courts to circumvent Congress and push through his own agenda, it only makes sense that we defer to the American people who will elect a new president to select the next Supreme Court justice. SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY, RANKING DEMOCRAT ON SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE The Supreme Court of the United States is too important to our democracy for it to be understaffed for partisan reasons. It is only February. The president and the Senate should get to work without delay to nominate, consider and confirm the next justice to serve on the Supreme Court. Unless (Obama) can find a consensus choice, the next president will pick the replacement for Justice Scalia ... If we lose the election, Hillary Clinton is going to pick somebody that I wouldnt pick. Im telling every conservative now, dont expect to lose the election and still get your way. I think it is too late to nominate someone now. He (Obama) has every right to nominate but it will be up to the Senate to evaluate that nomination ... and decide whether to move forward with it. My hope is that the president will promptly nominate someone with strong intellect and integrity who can win bipartisan support. I will work vigorously as a member of the Judiciary Committee to achieve confirmation. The Republicans in the Senate and on the campaign trail who are calling for Justice Scalias seat to remain vacant dishonor our Constitution. The Senate has a constitutional responsibility here that it cannot abdicate for partisan political reasons. While I differed with Justice Scalias views and jurisprudence, he was a brilliant, colorful and outspoken member of the Supreme Court. He was a justice who did not believe in legislating from the bench and he is a person whom I held in the highest regard and will always greatly respect his intelligence and conviction to uphold the constitution of our country. As liberals and conservatives alike would agree, through his powerful and persuasive opinions, Justice Scalia fundamentally changed how courts interpret the Constitution and statutes, returning the focus to the original meaning of the text after decades of judicial activism. One of the greatest honors in my life was to attend oral arguments during Town of Greece v. Galloway and see Justice Scalia eloquently defend religious freedom. His logic andwit were unparalleled, and his decisions were models of clarity and goodsense. I often said he was my favorite justice because he took theConstitution, and the responsibility of judges to interpret it correctly,with the utmost seriousness. OHIO GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE His death is a serious loss to our nation and the court. He was an essential, principled force for conservative thought and is a model for others to follow. It is imperative that the Senate not allow President Obama to diminish his legacy by trying to nominatean individual who would carry on his wishes to subvert the will of the people. I expect they will nominate a replacement and the Senate will refuse to take it up. From a policy standpoint, a lot of knotty decisions that might have been 5-4 will now be tied and, assuming the Senate wont act, the lower court rulings will stand. That means on immigration, for example, the Fifth Circuit ruling invalidating the presidents order may prevail. ",politicsNews,"February 14, 2016 ",1
Obama statement on death of Supreme Court Justice Scalia,"RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (Reuters) - Following is the full text of remarks from President Barack Obama on Saturday on the death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. THE PRESIDENT: Good evening, everybody.For almost 30 years, Justice Antonin Nino Scalia was a larger-than-life presence on the bench - a brilliant legal mind with an energetic style, incisive wit, and colorful opinions. He influenced a generation of judges, lawyers, and students, and profoundly shaped the legal landscape.He will no doubt be remembered as one of the most consequential judges and thinkers to serve on the Supreme Court. Justice Scalia dedicated his life to the cornerstone of our democracy:the rule of law.Tonight, we honor his extraordinary service to our nation and remember one of the towering legal figures of our time. Antonin Scalia was born in Trenton, New Jersey to an Italian immigrant family.After graduating from Georgetown University and Harvard Law School, he worked at a law firm and taught law before entering a life of public service.He rose from Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel to Judge on the D.C. Circuit Court, to Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. A devout Catholic, he was the proud father of nine children and grandfather to many loving grandchildren.Justice Scalia was both an avid hunter and an opera lover - a passion for music that he shared with his dear colleague and friend, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg.Michelle and I were proud to welcome him to the White House, including in 2012 for a state dinner for Prime Minister David Cameron.And tonight, we join his fellow justices in mourning this remarkable man. Obviously, today is a time to remember Justice Scalias legacy.I plan to fulfill my constitutional responsibilities to nominate a successor in due time.There will be plenty of time for me to do so, and for the Senate to fulfill its responsibility to give that person a fair hearing and a timely vote. These are responsibilities that I take seriously, as should everyone.Theyre bigger than any one party.They are about our democracy.Theyre about the institution to which Justice Scalia dedicated his professional life, and making sure it continues to function as the beacon of justice that our Founders envisioned. But at this moment, we most of all want to think about his family, and Michelle and I join the nation in sending our deepest sympathies to Justice Scalias wife, Maureen, and their loving family - a beautiful symbol of a life well lived.We thank them for sharing Justice Scalia with our country. God bless them all, and God bless the United States of America. ",politicsNews,"February 14, 2016 ",1
Supreme Court vacancy upends presidential race ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The sudden and shocking death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia opened a new and incendiary front in the already red-hot 2016 presidential race, one that promises to divide Democrats and Republicans and, perhaps, Republicans from themselves.  The vacancy on the court, which is now evenly split 4-4 between its conservative and liberal wings, had Republicans calling on President Barack Obama to refrain from choosing a successor to the right-leaning Scalia while Democrats urged Obama to do as the U.S. Constitution requires and put forward a candidate to face confirmation in an albeit hostile Senate. The prospect of such a battle drew swift and furious comment from candidates vying to be elected president in November. Facing off in a debate only hours after the 79-year-old Scalias death was announced, some Republican presidential candidates seized the moment to caution voters that their partys front-runner, billionaire businessman Donald Trump, could not be trusted to nominate a stalwart conservative.  If Donald Trump is president, he will appoint liberals, charged U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas during the debate in South Carolina, which holds a Republican nominating contest  next Saturday. Two branches of government hang in the balance, not just the presidency, but the Supreme Court, Cruz said. If we get this wrong, if we nominate the wrong candidate, the Second Amendment, life, marriage, religious liberty, every one of those hangs in the balance. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina also took a shot at Trump. Donald Trump is not a conservative, so I dont trust him to pick a judge, Graham said before the debate. A real estate mogul, Trump has supported Democratic politicians in the past. Trump, who also has taken several positions at odds with Republican orthodoxy, joined other candidates at the debate in insisting that Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican majority leader in the Senate, stand by his promise to block any Obama high court choice.  Its up to Mitch McConnell and everyone else to stop it, Trump, a former reality TV show host, said. Its called delay, delay, delay. Under the U.S. system, the president nominates justices for the nine-member court and the Senate confirms them. The last justice to be approved by the Senate of the opposite party during an election year was Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1988.  Obama has already indicated that he intends to send a choice to the Senate in coming weeks, meaning that the nominee will be heavily scrutinized by presidential candidates in both parties - and more than likely be opposed by the majority of Republicans.  The court may genuinely be a major issue this year, said David Axelrod, a former top political adviser to Obama. It will be a hell of a fight. Criticism of the court, which in recent years has upheld Obamas sweeping healthcare plan and legalized same-sex marriage, has already been a thread running through several Republican candidates campaigns.  The conservative majority on the court had appeared poised to invalidate Obamas immigration and climate-change policies. The loss of Scalia, considered to be a lodestar of conservative legal thought, and the potential swing of the court to the left, ensures that whatever drama plays out in the Senate this year will be mirrored on the campaign trail. There is no more clarifying debate in politics these days than when it comes to Supreme Court nominees, said Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist and former aide to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. This now is for all the marbles. Reid was majority leader of the Senate when it confirmed previous Obama court nominees Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Manley called McConnells threat not to allow a vote on a potential Scalia replacement completely beyond the pale. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton seemed inclined to make McConnells threat a campaign issue.  The Republicans in the Senate and on the campaign trail who are calling for Justice Scalias seat to remain vacant dishonor our Constitution, Clinton said in a statement.  Axelrod said that the issue could help Clinton, locked in a tight race with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.  I think it will make electability and experience in this realm more important, he said.   Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, and a longtime observer of the Supreme Court nomination process, said Obama likely has two options. He could nominate a more liberal candidate who would have no real chance of getting through a Republican Senate - in which case this would become a salient political issue in 2016, Hasen said. Or he could nominate a more moderate candidate who might gain enough Republican support to gain approval, he said.  There are risks to both approaches: A Republican obstruction of a liberal nominee would animate the Democratic Partys progressive base in an election year but would leave the court without a potentially tie-breaking vote for perhaps a year. That same Democratic base might view a moderate nominee as a betrayal, while conservative Republican voters likely would frown on any senator who voted to approve an Obama choice.  Manley said that McConnell has already shown that he is unwilling to support any choice made by Obama and that the White House must act aggressively. The president should go forward and nominate the most liberal candidate possible, he said.  Given the need to fire up its most passionate voters, that might just be exactly what Republican candidates want as well.

"Refusing to sit on lead, Trump gets bitter in Republican debate","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump, his face red with emotion, lashed out at rivals Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz on Saturday at the most acrimonious debate to date between Republican presidential candidates, shouting insults and casting aside a pledge to be more measured. The New York billionaire went into the CBS debate with a head of steam, having won New Hampshire last Tuesday and holding a big lead in polls in South Carolina a week before Republicans vote on Feb. 20. Rather than play it safe, Trump responded to every comment leveled his way, interrupted his opponents at will and called them liars repeatedly in an emotional outburst that could raise more questions about whether he has the temperament to serve in the White House.  He made his most blistering attacks against Bush and his brother, former President George W. Bush, who has many admirers in the Republican establishment. It was hard to declare a winner in the debate amid the constant volley of insults, not all of them from Trump. Cruz and fellow Senator Marco Rubio also took pointed jabs at each other over illegal immigration. But Trump dominated the debate conservation on Twitter with 40 percent of the mentions, according to data from the micro-blogging platform. Trumps combative style has set the tone for much of the campaign but in recent days he had pledged to pursue a more measured, positive approach. At the debate, that strategy lasted only through his comments about Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who was found dead on Saturday. Trump was quickly goaded when Bush criticized Trumps past statements that Russia has a role to play in Syria. Russia, Bush said, is not attacking Islamic State militants but instead helping Syrian President Bashir Assad, who Washington wants to leave power. Trump blasted Bushs brother for launching the Iraq war in 2003 over claims, later proven false, that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. A big, fat mistake, said Trump, noting that the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks had also occurred on Bushs watch. George Bush made a mistake, Trump thundered. We all make mistakes. But that one was a beauty ... They lied! They said there were weapons of mass destruction. And there were none. Many in the crowd booed Trump and the Republican front-runner dismissed them as lobbyists and special interests supporting the former Florida governor. Bush, who has wilted in the past under assault from Trump, stood firm this time. He will campaign with his brother George on Monday in North Charleston, South Carolina. Im sick and tired of him going after my family, Bush said. My dad is the greatest man alive in my mind. While Donald Trump was building a reality TV show, my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe. And Im proud of what he did. He had the gall to go after my mother, Bush said, reminding the audience that Trump had criticized his 90-year-old mother, Barbara Bush, wife of former President George H.W. Bush. My mother is the strongest woman I know. She should be running, Trump responded. Bush provoked another outburst from Trump by saying the Republican nominee should be someone who doesnt brag, for example, that he has been bankrupt four times. Thats another lie, Trump said. I never went bankrupt. Trump also was drawn into a fight with Cruz over whether the real estate developer is sufficiently conservative. Trump called himself a common-sense conservative, which Cruz dismissed. If Donald Trump is president he will appoint liberals to the Supreme Court, Cruz said. You are the biggest liar, Trump said sharply. As they tried to talk over each other, Cruz chided Trump by saying, Donald, adults do not interrupt each other. Ohio Governor John Kasich, who finished second in the New Hampshire primary last Tuesday and who pushes an optimistic message, called for calm. These attacks, some of them are personal. I think were fixing to lose the election to (Democratic front-runner) Hillary Clinton, he said. Cruz and Rubio renewed their battle over who is the toughest on illegal immigration with Cruz insisting that the Florida senator, as part of a Gang of Eight senators who sought a compromise on legislation in 2013, was for amnesty but now is against it for political purposes. He insisted that Rubio had said in Spanish on Univision that he would not rescind an executive order signed by President Barack Obama in support of the children of illegal immigrants. Rubio shot back: I dont know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesnt speaking Spanish. As the crowd roared, Rubio said Cruz is telling lies... Hes lying about all sorts of things and now he makes things up. Before the clashes broke out, the Republican candidates urged Obama not to nominate a successor to Scalia, saying it should be up to the next president to decide.

Trump would tax Carrier air conditioning units for moving to Mexico,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he would impose taxes on Carrier air conditioning units manufactured in Mexico in light of the companys decision to move production from Indiana, a position in line with his strong opposition to international trade deals. Video of the companys announcement last week to employees went viral on the Internet, showing emotional reactions to the loss of jobs while a representative of the company explained the move was strictly a business decision. Carrier, a manufacturer of air conditioning units, is owned by United Technologies Corp and announced it would be moving 1,400 jobs to Monterrey, Mexico. During Saturday nights Republican debate, Trump said if he were president, he would approach Carrier officials and give them two choices. Im going to tell them, Now Im going to get consensus from Congress and were going to tax you, Trump said. So stay where you are [in Mexico] or build in the United States. Because we are killing ourselves with trade pacts that are no good for us and no good for our workers. A central part of Trumps campaign message has been his opposition to international trade pacts that allow products manufactured overseas to be imported with limited or no tariffs. Its a policy position that reverberates with middle- and low- income Americans, who have watched manufacturing jobs leave the country in the last several decades. Trump cited the video of the workers, which has more than 2.8 million views on YouTube, at the debate.  If you saw the people, because they have a video of the announcement that Carrier is moving to Mexico, they were laid off, he said. They were crying. It was a very sad situation.

Senate leader McConnell says wait on replacing Scalia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Saturday that the next U.S. president should be the one to nominate a justice to fill the vacancy left on the Supreme Court by the death of Antonin Scalia. The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president, McConnell said in a statement. ",politicsNews,"February 13, 2016 ",1
Scalia's death set to affect court's rulings in current term,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The death of Justice Antonin Scalia on Saturday means that the normally nine-member U.S. Supreme Court will probably be down to eight when it rules on such divisive issues as abortion, immigration, affirmative action and the power of public-sector unions. With a replacement unlikely to be appointed before the current Supreme Court term ends in June, there is the possibility it will be split 4-4 on a string of rulings. When the court is equally divided, the lower court ruling remains in place but no national precedent is set. Scalias death will affect cases that have not yet been argued and those in which arguments were already held but no ruling has been issued. Court experts say that any preliminary votes Scalia took on cases already argued will no longer count. For a graphic of major cases before the court in the current term, see tmsnrt.rs/1Mcg8WN His death could deprive the courts conservative majority of some major wins, but does not guarantee wins for liberal causes. In the short term, Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who sometimes sides with the four liberals, will still be the key vote. That could change the outcome of a major case argued in January that could affect the influence of public-sector unions. The issue is whether public employees who do not want to join a union can be required to pay fair share service fees, which are equivalent to members dues, without violating First Amendment rights of free speech and association. Based on the oral arguments, it appeared the conservative majority was ready to vote against the unions. Now, a 4-4 split is a likely outcome, which would hand a win to the unions as that would leave the lower courts ruling in their favor in place. Similarly, the court in December considered an important affirmative action dispute over whether a University of Texas admissions program that considers the race of some applicants to ensure campus diversity violates the constitutional guarantee of equality. It was unclear based on the oral argument how the court would vote.  Justice Elena Kagan was already recused in that case, so Scalias death means there can no longer be a 4-4 split. The liberal wing could now win if Kennedy joins them. That would lead to an unexpected victory for affirmative action advocates. The court has not yet heard oral arguments in three major cases in which Scalia was likely to be a key vote on the conservative wing of the court. On March 2, the court will consider a tough new abortion law in Texas that womens health providers say infringes upon the constitutional right of women to have an abortion. The law requires clinics carrying out abortions to have costly hospital-grade facilities and requires physicians carrying out abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of where they are operating. It is the courts first abortion case since 2007. If the court was split 4-4, the law would be upheld. In April, the court is due to weigh President Barack Obamas bid to resurrect his plan to shield more than four million illegal immigrants from deportation, a unilateral executive action he took in 2014 to bypass the Republican-led Congress. Scalias death does not necessarily boost the administrations chances. Obamas executive action was blocked by lower courts, meaning a 4-4 split would leave that ruling intact.

U.S. recovers Hellfire air-to-ground missile from Cuba,"WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - The United States has recovered an inert Hellfire air-to-ground missile that had mistakenly ended up in Cuba, U.S. and Cuban officials said on Saturday. The laser-guided AGM 114 Hellfire mistakenly arrived in Cuba in June 2014 and was retrieved on Saturday by U.S. officials and representatives of Lockheed Martin Corp, the missiles owner, the Cuban foreign ministry said in a statement. We can say, without speaking to specifics, that the inert training missile has been returned with the cooperation of the Cuban government, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement. Lockheed Martin spokesman Bill Phelps declined comment. The missile had been sent to Europe for a training exercise in 2014 but somehow ended up in Cuba in an embarrassing loss of military technology, the Wall Street Journal reported last month. The department is restricted under federal law and regulations from commenting on specific defense trade licensing cases and compliance matters, so we cannot provide further details, Toner said. But he said reestablished diplomatic relations between the two countries have helped the U.S. engage with the Cuban government on issues of mutualinterest. Cuba said the missile arrived by mistake or mishandling on a commercial flight from Paris and was not listed on the cargo manifest, and that it was discovered by customs inspectors. Once the U.S. government officially informed the Cuban government that a training missile belonging to the company Lockheed Martin was mistakenly sent to our country and expressed its interest in recovering it, Cuba communicated the decision to hand it over and started arrangements for its return, the Cuban statement said, without revealing when the United States made the request. A team of U.S. government and Lockheed Martin experts took the missile back to the United States on Saturday, Cuba said. ",politicsNews,"February 13, 2016 ",1
Loser! Jerk! Insults fly on Republican campaign trail ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - For months Republican presidential candidates traded insults such as dummy, jerk and loser. Then, party front-runner Donald Trump repeated a supporters description of Ted Cruz as a pussy. With the contest for the partys nomination moving into South Carolina and the stakes rising, it is possible the most disparaging discourse of the Nov. 8 election campaign is yet to come.  The epithets may be characteristic of schoolyard bullies, but there is some evidence that candidates are reveling in the attention they draw. The harshest attacks elicit the biggest responses at rallies, on the Internet and on cable TV. Trump, the billionaire former reality TV star, sent a New Hampshire rally into a frenzy on Monday when he repeated the term pussy shouted by a person in the crowd, effectively questioning Cruzs manliness. Trump went on to win the states primary the next day, ahead of the third-place Cruz by a 3-to-1 margin. Its one of the reasons I won. You have to be yourself, Trump said in a television interview on NBCs Today show. Trump later promised to clean up his foul language and to be more presidential.   History suggests the language could turn even more coarse in the run-up to next Saturdays Republican nominating contest in South Carolina. It was there that U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona was accused in 2000 of fathering an illegitimate African-American child, and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in 2008 of supporting polygamy. These adults are acting like elementary children,  Leslie McRobbie, a former fifth-grade schoolteacher from New Hampshire, said of this years Republican contenders.   President Barack Obama, a Democrat, this week spoke of the snark that characterized a Republican race of the past when he recalled that Ronald Reagan was described by rivals as an unshapely man and a yahoo before his election as president in 1980. Coming off the first nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, the seven remaining candidates for the Republican nomination are under pressure either to break away from the crowd or prevent others from doing so.  Insults can foster that. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush,mocked more than once by Trump as a low-energy candidate, has since retaliated by tweeting thatTrumpwasnot just a loser, but also a liar and a whiner. The put-downwas re-tweeted nearly 3,000 times and liked by more than 4,000 users.  Cruz, responding to Trumps decision to skip a Fox News-hosted Republican debate, branded his rival Ducking Donald and sponsored a special edition filter on picture-sharing app Snapchat that featured a blond-haired duck with an exaggerated pout meant to represent the real-estate mogul. When we create so much of the modern campaign around the characters that are running, and not on the subjects, the natural byproduct of that is calling people names, said political scientist Michael Artime. Artime said that while bickering and name-calling have always existed in elections, this cycle has seen a notable uptick in the negative. In the past, if somebody wouldve said what Trump said the other night, that would have been a very damaging thing to their campaign, Artime said. The kind of politics we get is kind of the politics we deserve, he said.  While many have gleefully or indifferently watched as candidates hurled barb after barb, others have condemned it. Bullying can be highly instrumental and used for social climbing, said Bob Faris, associate professor of sociology at University of California-Davis, who studies aggressive behavior in adolescents. And it works, he said, provided that kids target the right kids. For Trump, perhaps the most blustery of the candidates, the target is constantly changing, his numbers remaining constant in the opinion polls while he assails rivals for being stupid, weak and pathetic. He does look like a bully, Faris said. Donald is a whole new development. I cant think of a candidate like him. Presidential historian Mike Purdy, however, cites a precedent in the late Republican President Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt loved more than anything else to be the center of attention, and he had a huge, huge ego, Purdy said. They both have a certain amount of ego. They both have trouble controlling their mouths, Purdy said, likening Roosevelt to Trump. Purdy said Roosevelt called his onetime ally William Howard Taft a fathead during the 1912 presidential campaign, and went on to say then-rival Taft, seeking re-election at the time, had the brains of a guinea pig. Neither won the race. Purdy noted the attacks also came at the expense of substantive political discourse.  Theyre incredibly personal attacks, and theyre not just attacks just on somebodys position, theyre attacks about personal characteristics, he said. That is part of the civility I think we need to recapture. On Friday, Trump suggested he agreed. I do this for effect, Trump said of his foul language in an interview with WOR Radio in New York. As we get closer, you will be shocked at how presidential I will be. You will be very proud of me.  (Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Howard Goller) SAP is the sponsor of this content.

"Clinton, Sanders clash over Obama as they vie for minority votes","MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed sharply in a debate on Thursday over their support for President Barack Obama, with Sanders accusing Clinton of a low blow after she compared him to Republicans. As the Democratic race moves to states with large minority populations, both candidates openly courted black and Hispanic votes during a debate that was far more restrained and cordial than last weeks contentious debate in New Hampshire. In the sharpest exchange of the night, Clinton attacked Sanders for being too critical of Obama, who is extremely popular with the black voters who will play a big role in the outcome in South Carolina and other upcoming nominating contests. The kind of criticism that weve heard from Senator Sanders about our president, I expect from Republicans, I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama, said Clinton, who served as secretary of state during Obamas first term. Madam Secretary, that is a low blow, said Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont. Sanders said he had been an Obama ally in the Senate even if he did not always agree with him. Do senators have the right to disagree with the president? Sanders said. Clinton, who has eagerly embraced Obamas legacy, said Sanders had called Obama weak and a disappointment, and that goes further than saying we have our disagreements. With Clinton looking to rebound after her crushing 22-point loss to Sanders in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, the two also differed over healthcare and Wall Street.  Even so, the restrained exchange on Thursday was unlikely to change the trajectory of a race that has intensified dramatically over two weeks. Clinton accused Sanders of misleading Americans on his healthcare. She said his proposal for a single-payer, Medicare-for-all healthcare plan would mean dismantling the program known as Obamacare and triggering another intense political struggle. Based on every analysis I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers dont add up, Clinton told Sanders. Thats a promise that cannot be kept. Sanders said he was simply moving to provide what most industrialized countries have - healthcare coverage for all. Were not going to dismantle anything, Sanders said. In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that. Sanders also repeated his accusation that Clinton is too beholden to the Wall Street interests she once represented as a U.S. senator from New York, noting her Super PAC received $15 million in donations from Wall Street. Lets not insult the intelligence of the American people, he said. Why in Gods name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions? I guess just for the fun of it, they want to throw money around. Clinton said the donations did not mean she was in Wall Streets pocket, and noted that President Barack Obama had taken donations from Wall Street during his campaigns. When it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street, she said. With an eye to on the minority vote, both candidates decried the high incarceration rate of African-Americans and called for broad reforms of the criminal justice system. Sanders said the disproportionately high rate of incarceration for black men was one of the great tragedies in the United States. He called for fundamental police reform that would make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will in fact be dealt with. Clinton criticized what she called systemic racism in education, housing and employment. When we talk about criminal justice reform  we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing and other ways of helping communities of color, she said. They both agreed on the need for immigration reform, an important issue to Hispanic voters, though they clashed over the Obama administrations actions on handling a wave of undocumented children who entered the country alone. Clinton criticized Sanders for voting against a reform measure in 2007, which Sanders defended because of a provision in the bill for guest workers. Clinton entered Thursdays debate under acute pressure to calm growing nervousness among her supporters after her drubbing in New Hampshire and a razor-thin win the prior week in the Iowa caucus. Both states have nearly all-white populations. For his part, Sanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist, hoped to harness the momentum and enthusiasm he gained from the first two contests and prove he can be a viable contender to lead the Democratic Party to victory in the Nov. 8 presidential election. What our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, Sanders said. They want a political revolution. Clinton dodged an opportunity to distance herself from former Secretary of State Madeleine Albrights recent controversial comments that there was a special place in hell for women who dont support other women. Look, I think that shes been saying that for as long as Ive known her, which is about 25 years. But it doesnt change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make, she said. On the foreign policy front, Sanders criticized Clinton for her warm relationship for Henry Kissinger, who served as secretary of state under Republican President Richard Nixon during the Vietnam War. Sanders called Kissinger one of the most destructive secretaries of state. Asked by Clinton about who his foreign policy advisers were, Sanders shot back: Well it aint Henry Kissinger. The race now moves to what should be more favorable ground for Clinton in Nevada and South Carolina, states with more black and Hispanic voters, who, polls show, have been more supportive of Clinton so far.

"From a river town in Slovenia to Trump Tower, and the White House?","SEVNICA, Slovenia (Reuters) - If Melania Trump succeeds Michelle Obama as First Lady, she may trace her road to the White House back to 1987 and a chance encounter in the capital of her native Slovenia. I was leaving a fashion show in Ljubljana and saw her in front of the building. She was probably waiting for a friend, said Slovenian photographer Stane Jerko. She was tall and slim so she caught my eye and I approached her and suggested that she come in for a trial photo shoot. Jerko says the resulting black-and-white pictures of the 17-year-old known then as Melanija Knavs  round face, bare feet, hair in a ponytail  launched a career that would take her to Milan and the United States, where she met Donald Trump at a party in New York in 1998. Though not quite a tale of rags to riches, the lifestyle she leads as the third wife of the billionaire businessman is a far cry from her roots in Slovenia, a tiny former Yugoslav republic of 2 million people comparable in size to New Jersey and nestled below the Julian Alps between Italy, Croatia, Austria and Hungary.  Residents of the small town of Sevnica in southeastern Slovenia, where Melania grew up on the banks of the River Sava, say her father sold car parts and that her mother worked for a factory that made childrens clothing. She was often seen sewing late into the evening at home. Some media reports have said her father was a member of the then ruling Communist Party, like many other people in socialist Yugoslavia, but Reuters could not independently confirm this. The Trump campaign team offered Reuters a different account of her childhood and career, saying Melania began modelling at the age of five, that her mother was a fashion designer and her father a manager in a car company. Her father was never a member of the Communist Party, a spokesperson said.  Since taking a gilded escalator with her husband at his Fifth Avenue Trump Tower skyscraper in June last year when he announced his decision to run for president, Melania has adopted a low profile in his campaign for the Republican Party nomination. She does not appear at his rallies, where Trump occasionally brings out his children instead, though he rarely fails to mention her.  When I saw whom she married I noticed a number of similarities between Donald Trump and Melanijas father, said Mirjana Jelancic, who said she was a childhood friend of Melania. They have similar features and behaviour and are both hard workers. I think she met a soul mate in him, someone she can feel safe with. The Knavs family lived in an apartment block, moving when Melania was a teenager to a modest two-storey house above the Sava on the outskirts of Sevnica, where a well-maintained medieval castle sits on a hill overlooking the town of some 4,500 people. Melanias parents still live in the house, which has a small garden and a few fruit trees, though they spent a lot of time in the United States, where Melanias sister Ines also lives. The house was empty when Reuters reporters visited and repeated phone calls went unanswered. Jelancic recalled Melania as a model student keen on the arts, geography and history. She loved reading. She always carried books with her, said Jelancic. I also remember she had wall bars at home and trained regularly to keep her body in shape. Melanija liked beautiful clothes and knew how to wear them, said Jelancic, now headmistress at Melanias former elementary school.  She liked to give them a personal touch by redesigning them and was very good at upgrading old things. It was clear she would work in fashion though she never said that she wanted to be a model. I remember her telling me how she cannot wait to go to Ljubljana where she attended a high school for design. She had a wish to see the world. It was in Ljubljana that she was discovered and began modelling full-time, coming second place in a 1992 national beauty pageant the year after Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia and fought a ten-day war to strike out alone.  She was shy at first but learnt quickly and showed great interest in every detail of the shoot, said Jerko. She was like a sleeping chrysalis that transformed into a glamorous butterfly, he gushed. The future Mrs Trump did not look back, changing her name to the more easily pronounceable Melania Knauss. No one in Sevnica spoken to by Reuters recalled having seen her there in recent years. She did, however, donate an ambulance to the local health clinic to celebrate the birth of her son, Barron, in 2006, a year after marrying Trump, 24 years her senior.  Some speculated that the town might receive another donation or more publicity if Trump wins the presidency. Those Reuters spoke to would not be drawn on his politics, which are stridently anti-immigration.  Jerko, a youthful 78 years-old with short grey hair and beard, still keeps a file with Melanias pictures and measurements. Im sure she would be happy if her husband became U.S. president. I think she is very proud of his achievements and I believe I had something to do with where she is today. ",politicsNews,"February 12, 2016 ",1
Young blacks more open to Bernie Sanders' White House bid,"ORANGEBURG, S.C. (Reuters) - If Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders has a chance of drawing African-American voters away from rival Hillary Clinton in South Carolinas presidential nominating contest on Feb. 27, his best opportunity will be among the young. African Americans support former Secretary of State Clinton by more than a 3-to-1 margin nationwide, but among young blacks 18 to 29 years old, that margin shrinks to 46 percent for Clinton versus 33 percent for Sanders, according to recent Reuters/Ipsos polling. African Americans overwhelmingly back Democrats, but opinion polls in the run-up to the Nov. 8 presidential election show younger blacks more apt to reject an establishment candidate. They seem less inclined than their parents to reward Clinton for the outreach of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and more drawn to Sanders outspoken views on reducing income inequality, cracking down on Wall Street, and cutting the cost of college. Reuters/Ipsos polling last year showed that 36 percent of blacks between 18 and 29 years old thought the country was on the wrong track, compared with 23 percent of blacks who were at least 60 years old. For Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who describes himself as a democratic socialist, this trend could help him chip away at Clintons firewall of minority voters in the southern states, after his strong showings against her - especially among the young - in the early Democratic Party contests of Iowa and New Hampshire, both more than 90 percent white. The voting-age population in South Carolina, one of the next stops on the primary trail, is about 67 percent white and 27 percent black, the U.S. Census Bureau says. In Orangeburg, South Carolina, studentsat the historically black schools of South Carolina State University and Claflin University appeared split this week over which of the two candidates to support. Students praised Clintons work on behalf of women and minorities and her years of Washington experience. But many said they also were intrigued by Sanders plans to raise taxes on wealthier people and Wall Street firms, provide universal healthcare and offer free public college tuition. The history is important. But at the same time ... you still need a plan, said Travis Pascoe, 25, a second-year graduate student at Claflin. He said Sanders plans for reducing inequality by taxing the wealthy and expanding Medicare to cover all Americans should resonate with the black community. I think that would help the black community because were the least privileged, he said.  Eight of 16 students interviewed were undecided voters. Of the eight students whose minds were made up, four students said they planned to vote for Clinton.  Ethel Hillman, 25, a freshman who served in the military before going to college for social work, said she and many of her fellow students were voting for Clinton. She described Sanders as too aloof. Hes not socially connected, I would say, to the black community, she said. He cares from a distance. South Carolina States student center, which houses a bowling center and dining area, has quotes on walls from prominent black leaders, including President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, singer Michael Jackson and educator Booker T. Washington.  On one wall is a memorial to students killed in the 1968 Orangeburg massacre, when protesters were shot by state highway patrol officers on campus amid tensions over racial discrimination. For Sanders, minority voters have been a lingering weakness. He struggled early in his campaign to appeal to black voters. Protesters from the Black Lives Matter movement interrupted his speeches, viewing him as out of touch with black issues. To counter that perception, Sanders touted his college civil rights activism, did publicity events with rapper Killer Mike, and on Wednesday met black civil rights leader Al Sharpton in Harlem. Like Clinton, Sanders has sent surrogates to historically black colleges. The writer and activist Cornel West spoke at South Carolina State on Sanders behalf, and actress Angela Bassett spoke there in support of Clinton.      Where Sanders is fighting for inroads into the black electorate, Clinton finds a comfort zone. Her campaign has said it believes its road to the nomination would become smoother once it moves south, to places where she and her husband, the former president, have ties to minority leaders. Clinton picked up the endorsement of the Congressional Black Caucus political action committee on Thursday. As the stakes mount in South Carolina, Representative Jim Clyburn, one of the states most influential Democrats, said he was considering endorsing a candidate. He did not endorse in Hillary Clintons 2008 primary race against Obama, and previously said he would not weigh in this year. His wavering was echoed in the views of several students on the campus of South Carolina State. Im kind of caught between Bernie Sanders and Hillary, said Kelsie Bryant, 19, a sophomore education major at South Carolina State. She said it was important to have a woman president, and she was worried Sanders was too old. But she said his meeting with Sharpton sent a positive signal about his outreach to blacks. Cetris Brooks, 21, a senior biology major at South Carolina State, said that ultimately she was a little bit more trusting of Clinton because of what the former first lady meant to her family. She said her parents had long supported Clinton, and her uncle knew the former president.

"Senate passes 'provocative' China bill, Cruz lifts nominee holds","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Friday backed a plan to name a plaza in front of the Chinese embassy for a pro-democracy dissident after what congressional sources called a tit-for-tat deal that led Senator Ted Cruz to stop blocking President Barack Obamas diplomatic nominations. By unanimous voice vote, the Senate approved a bill introduced by Cruz, a leading contender for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, to name the plaza in Washington after Liu Xiaobo, a Nobel peace prize winner. Its provocative and counterproductive. We strongly urge the U.S. side to stop such actions, Chinese embassy spokesman Zhu Haiquan said in an emailed statement. Cruz spokesman Phil Novack said the senator had ended his holds on nominees including Obamas new ambassadors to Norway and Sweden and two top State Department officials. The Senate also confirmed those nominations on Friday. Senate rules allow any member to block a nomination by a procedure known as a hold. Cruz had imposed the holds last year after Washington and other world powers reached a deal with Iran in which it agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Novack said Cruz lifted his holds because he had successfully drawn attention to what he considers deep problems with the nuclear pact. He declined comment on whether there was an agreement over the plaza bill. I am not going to comment or say anything about process, Novack said. Several Senate sources, including high-level Republicans and Democrats knowledgeable about the process, said Cruz had dropped the holds after Obamas fellow Democrats said they would not oppose the plaza-naming measure. Novack said the issues go hand in hand in that China and Iran are both criticized for rights violations. A White House spokesman said Obamas senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill, adding: While we continue to impress upon China the imperative of respecting human rights and releasing Liu Xiaobo, as well as other political prisoners, we do not believe Senator Cruzs ploy to rename a street in Washington, DC is an effective way to achieve either goal. The nominees held by Cruz and confirmed Friday included Brian Egan to be States Legal Advisor, Thomas Shannon as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Azita Raji to be Ambassador to Sweden, Samuel Heins to be Ambassador to Norway, John Estrada to be Ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago and David McKean as Ambassador to Luxembourg.

Former Virginia Governor Gilmore drops Republican presidential bid,"(Reuters) - Former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore ended his long-shot campaign for the Republican presidential nomination on Friday after dismal showings in the first two contests in the race. Gilmore announced his decision to quit the race in a Facebook post. His departure leaves six candidate vying for the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election, with the next contest on Feb. 20 in South Carolina.

Gilmore, 66, entered the race in July but he made few campaign appearances by comparison to his rivals, and his candidacy never gained traction. He managed vote totals of less than 1 percent in the Iowa caucuses earlier this month and the New Hampshire primary.

U.S. and Cuba to sign aviation pact on Feb. 16,"(Reuters) - Top U.S. officials will travel to Havana on Feb. 16 to sign an aviation pact that restores scheduled airline service between the United States and Cuba for the first time in more than 50 years, the U.S. Transportation Department said on Friday. The signing brings into effect an arrangement the Cold War foes agreed upon on Dec. 16. U.S. airlines still must apply for permission from U.S. regulators to fly specific routes before they sell tickets to Cuba.

Kristie Kenney named State Department's new counselor,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Kristie Kenney, a former U.S. ambassador to Thailand, the Philippines and Ecuador, was named on Friday as the State Departments new counselor, succeeding Tom Shannon, who has been confirmed as under secretary of state for political affairs. Kenneys appointment makes her one of the most senior women foreign service officers in the United States, Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement naming her to the position. Shannons nomination had been delayed mainly by Senator Ted Cruzs opposition to the Iran nuclear deal reached last July by six major world powers, including the United States, and Iran.

"Congress passes tougher North Korea sanctions, sends bill to Obama","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed legislation on Friday broadening sanctions to punish North Korea for its nuclear program, human rights record and cyber crimes, and sent the measure to President Barack Obama to sign into law. Lawmakers said they wanted to make Washingtons resolve clear to Pyongyang, but also to the United Nations and other governments, especially China, North Koreas lone major ally and main business partner. The package includes sanctions targeting North Korea and  secondary sanctions against those who do business with it. The vote was 408-2, following a 96-0 vote in the Senate on Wednesday. Impatient with what they see as Obamas failure to respond to North Korean provocations, many of his fellow Democrats as well as the Republicans who control Congress have been clamoring for a clampdown since Pyongyang tested a nuclear device in January. Pressure for congressional action further intensified after last weekends satellite launch by North Korea. Obama is not expected to veto the bill, given its huge support in Congress. White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters on board Air Force One that the administration was deeply concerned about North Koreas recent actions and would not oppose the legislation. Were philosophically and intellectually in the same place as the Congress on this, Schultz said. The legislation would sanction anyone who engages in, facilitates or contributes to North Koreas proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, arms-related materials, luxury goods, human rights abuses, activities undermining cyber security and the provision of materials for such activities. Penalties include seizure of assets, visa bans and denial of government contracts. Unusually, the measure makes most of the sanctions mandatory instead of giving the president the option to impose them. He can temporarily waive them by making the case that doing so would threaten national security. The House had backed the sanctions measure 418-2 in January, but the Senate included some new provisions, including cyber security measures, in its version, sending it back to the House.

House seen passing North Korea sanctions bill Friday,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives will vote on Friday on legislation broadening sanctions against North Korea that is expected to pass with overwhelming support, sending the measure to the White House for President Barack Obama to sign into law. The House backed the sanctions measure 418-2 in January, but the Senate included some new provisions, including cybersecurity measures, in the version of the bill that it passed 96-0 on Wednesday, sending it back to the House. The proposed sanctions come after a satellite launch seen by Washington and its allies as cover for development of ballistic missile technology that could be used to deliver a nuclear weapon. House Speaker Paul Ryan said the House would consider the amended version of the bill this week, and aides said the vote would likely take place on Friday morning. We have moved one step closer to a new round of North Korea sanctions, Ryan told reporters in his weekly news conference. Obama is not expected to veto the bill, given its huge support in Congress. Ben Rhodes, his deputy national security adviser, said the White House would review the measure but does not oppose Congress efforts. I think this is an area where we and Congress are in the same space and agree on the need for increased sanctions, Rhodes told an event at the Center for American Progress on Thursday.

Louisiana governor says state's finances in dire situation,"(Reuters) - Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards presented a dire picture of the states fiscal situation on Thursday, urging lawmakers to consider a set of budget cuts and revenue-raising measures, including tax increases. Edwards made his remarks before state legislators convene for a special session on Sunday to hash out how to fix the budget woes. The state is contending with a $940 million budget deficit for the current fiscal year and a $2 billion projected deficit for the next fiscal year starting in July. This is a historic fiscal crisis, the likes of which our state has never seen, Edwards said during Thursdays televised address. He warned that the states public colleges and universities will face catastrophic cuts over the next four months. Louisiana is at risk of not being able to pay student scholarships that have already been awarded, and some campuses will be forced to cancel classes, even file for bankruptcy. If you are a student attending one of these universities, it means that you will receive a grade of incomplete, many students will not be able to graduate, said Edwards. You can say farewell to college football next fall. The governor also warned that the states healthcare system was on the verge of imploding. Without new revenues, hospitals that care for a significant portion of poor and under-insured patients would close in places like Lake Charles, Alexandria and Bogalusa. I dont say this to scare you. But I am going to be honest with you. No more tricks. No more smoke and mirrors, said Edwards, a Democrat who took office last month. Louisianas former Governor Bobby Jindal had signed a no tax pledge, which handicapped the state from raising new revenues. Edwards on Thursday juxtaposed Louisianas finances when Jindal took office in 2008 - when the state enjoyed a $1 billion surplus - to today, when the state is facing a looming $2 billion projected deficit. The budget problems in Louisiana, a big oil-producing state, stem in part from the global drop in oil prices, in addition to the states reliance in recent years on one-time money and lower-than-expected revenues.  Edwards has proposed several budget fixes, including a 1-cent sales tax hike and increases to alcohol and cigarette taxes. He would freeze hiring for state workers, reduce state contracts, and cut $160 million of state funding. He has also proposed tapping $128 million from the rainy day fund and $200 million from non-coastal BP payments to reduce the current year deficit. ",politicsNews,"February 12, 2016 ",1
House panel approves plan to privatize air traffic control,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives panel approved legislation to privatize the U.S. air traffic control system on Thursday as part of a six-year bill to authorize funding for the Federal Aviation Administration. Democrats failed in their attempt to amend the legislation to retain the flight service as part of the FAA.  By a 32-26 vote along party lines, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee sent the measure to the floor for consideration by the full House. Republicans, including committee Chairman Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, say air traffic control must be transferred to the private sector to protect the system from deficit reductions and government shutdowns and to ensure timely upgrade of decades-old technology. Our proposal ensures that the air traffic organization can operate as a high-tech service provider, not as a huge bumbling bureaucracy, Shuster said at a hearing to mark up the legislation for full House consideration.  The failed Democratic amendment to keep air traffic control within the FAA would have made FAA funding mandatory, protecting it from political squabbles over the budget. It would also have required reforms to ensure adequate controller staffing and the more efficient FAA adoption of new technology. The only guarantee with privatization is years of transition costs and litigation, said Representative Peter DaFazio, the top Democrat on the committee, who had introduced the amendment. Regrettably, including this controversial proposal in this legislation is likely to hold up enactment of the rest of the bill.  The committee also rejected a proposed Democratic amendment that would have lifted existing restrictions on the ability of the U.S. Transportation Department to regulate air shipments of lithium batteries, seen by safety experts as dangerous fire hazards when transported as cargo.                 Over the objections of Democrats, the panel approved a measure directing the FAA to authorize package delivery by commercial drones within a year and to establish a pilot program for testing a traffic management system for unmanned aircraft.  The FAA expects to issue commercial drone regulations late this summer, but drone advocates fear the rules will not accommodate sophisticated technologies needed for package delivery.   Also accepted was a Republican amendment to encourage Uber-style flight sharing by allowing private pilots to use the Internet to find multiple passengers willing to share flight expenses.

Senate panel to hear from U.S. antitrust bosses,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate Judiciary Committees antitrust subcommittee will hear from the top U.S. antitrust bosses next month to discuss a wave of big mergers over the past year, according to a staffer briefed on the hearing. The Justice Departments Bill Baer, the assistant attorney general for the antitrust division, and Edith Ramirez, chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, will testify, the staffer said. The two divide the work of antitrust enforcement. The hearing will be March 9 at the Senate Judiciary Committees antitrust panel, which is headed by Senator Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah. One matter that will be taken up is the FTCs use of Section Five, a portion of its authority that it uses to investigate companies which urge rivals to collude with them on price. The agencies are looking at a startling number of major, controversial mergers. The Justice Department is investigating two large insurance mergers - Aetna Inc (AET.N) buying Humana Inc (HUM.N) and Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) buying Cigna Corp (CI.N) - to insure they comply with antitrust law. It is also looking at Halliburton Cos (HAL.N) purchase of Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N, among a long list of other deals. The FTC is suing Staples Inc SPLS.O in hopes of stopping it from buying Office Depot Inc (ODP.O). It also said in late 2015 that it aimed to stop three mergers of medical centers, one in West Virginia, another in Chicago and a third in Pennsylvania. ",politicsNews,"February 11, 2016 ",1
Defense Department promises plan to defeat Islamic State,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Defense will soon submit a plan to Congress on how to defeat Islamic State, a defense official said on Thursday, four days before a deadline.  The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a defense policy bill President Barack Obama signed into law in November, required the administration to submit its strategy for defeating the militant group to lawmakers by Feb. 15. Republican congressional leaders said on Thursday they had had no indication that the report was imminent despite the short time remaining before the deadline. We are aware of the report and are actively working with multiple interagency offices to complete this legal requirement per the NDAA and look forward to submitting the completed report to Congress in the near-term, the Department of Defense official said on condition of anonymity, in an emailed statement. Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, issued a statement earlier Thursday calling on Obama, a Democrat, to submit by Monday a real, comprehensive strategy for defeating Islamic State. The United States is leading a military campaign against the militant Islamist group, which has seized swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq. Republicans in Congress have sharply criticized Obama for failing to defeat Islamic State, saying he mistakenly underestimated the threat it posed, allowing it to gain strength. U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter started talks in Brussels on Thursday with more than two dozen defense ministers, pressing allies to contribute to the effort. ",politicsNews,"February 12, 2016 ",1
Obama says confident in legal footing after Supreme Court carbon decision,"ATHERTON, Calif./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday called the Supreme Courts decision to delay implementation of his administrations Clean Power Plan unusual and expressed confidence that the White House would prevail. Were very confident that were on strong legal footing here, he told a group of Democratic donors in California in his first public remarks about the move. In Washington, Gina McCarthy, Obamas head of the Environmental Protection Agency, told state energy and environmental regulators that the ruling is not going to slow us down. The Supreme Court on Tuesday delivered a blow to the plan, the centerpiece of Obamas climate change policy and backbone of his administrations commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions pledged last year in Paris. Obama said the Supreme Court had in fact required the EPA to regulate carbon emissions under the Clean Air Act if they were shown, as scientists had, to be harmful to public health. He said some people had commented to him in recent days that the Supreme Courts decision had struck down the Clean Power Plan. Thats not true. So dont despair, people, he said. McCarthy told state regulators tasked with complying with the rule she is confident the plan will survive the legal challenges and tried to boost morale among the officials. I want you to do as I am doing, McCarthy told the crowd. Pick myself up, rededicate myself and tell the people in this country that we are there to serve them, she said, while shaking her fists in the air. The Supreme Court stay was a small pause in what has been a years-long effort of the EPA and states to get the Clean Power Plan off the ground, she said. The plan was designed to lower carbon emissions from U.S. power plants by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels. The Supreme Court ordered a delay in implementation until legal challenges to the regulation are completed.  This Supreme Court has said the Environmental Protection Agency is required to regulate carbon emissions if its a threat to the public health. And we clearly can show that thats the case, Obama said. Fighting climate change is critical to the presidents legacy as he completes his final year in office. ",politicsNews,"February 11, 2016 ",1
Longtime Trump advisor Scavino appointed his social media director,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A campaign advisor and longtime employee of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been appointed his social media director, the campaign said on Thursday.  Dan Scavino, who was executive vice president and general manager at the Trump Organization, the Republican frontrunners real estate company, from 2003 to 2013, has worked directly with Trump on social media strategy in his bid to become president.  Trump has actively used social media platforms such as Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc to reach his supporters, often launching personal attacks on those who cross paths with him or simply retweeting his fans. So far, the real estate mogul has had some success with that approach, receiving the biggest share of mentions on Twitter during Republican presidential debates. During Saturdays debate, he garnered 33 percent of the social conversation, according to Twitter.  While social media traction doesnt necessarily translate to votes, it can indicate overall interest in a candidate. Trump finished first in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday and second in last weeks Iowa caucuses. The candidate will continue to tweet for himself despite Scavinos new role, said Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign.  Scavino, who tweets under the handle @DanScavino, has more than 51,000 followers on Twitter. Many of his tweets are jabs at Trumps competitors.

State Dept. subpoenaed documents from Clinton Foundation: report,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. State Department investigators last year issued a subpoena to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation seeking documents about projects run by the charity that may have required U.S. government approval when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, the Washington Post reported on Thursday. A U.S. official said the matter was being investigated by the Inspector General, the State Departments internal watchdog. Citing unnamed sources for the report, the Post said the subpoena issued in the fall also asked for records related to senior Clinton aide Huma Abedin, who for six months in 2012 simultaneously worked for several employers including the State Department, the foundation, and Clintons personal office. The report follows a Reuters investigation last year that found the Clinton Foundations flagship health project did not submit new or increased payments from at least seven foreign governments to the State Department for review, in breach of the ethics agreement Clinton signed with the incoming Obama administration in order to become secretary of state. Clinton, who is running for the Democratic nomination in the Nov. 8 presidential election, has been criticized for using a private email account hosted on a private computer while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, a matter the FBI is investigating. Spokesmen for Clintons campaign and the Clinton Foundation and a lawyer for Abedin did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. A spokesman for the Inspector General also declined to comment. The Post quoted an unnamed foundation representative as saying the initial document request had been narrowed by investigators and that the foundation was not the focus of the probe. It said there was no indication that the investigators were looking at Clinton. The full scope and status of the inquiry, conducted by the State Departments inspector general, were not clear from the material correspondence reviewed by the Washington Post, the paper said. Sources familiar with investigations into the controversy surrounding Clintons private email server said they had no reason to believe any government agency was conducting any kind of inquiry into possible criminal violations related to the former secretary of state.

Congress approves permanent Internet access tax ban,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday passed legislation placing a permanent ban on states taxing Internet access, sending the measure to President Barack Obama for signing into law. By a vote of 75-20, the Senate gave final approval to a bill toughening enforcement of U.S. duties on foreign goods, which contains the permanent extension of the Internet Tax Freedom Act. The measure also would ban some taxes on digital goods and services and will put an end to a series of temporary extensions on the tax prohibitions. Most Americans pay $0 in taxes to connect to the Internet. And thanks to a bill that passed today, you will never have to pay taxes just to get online, or pay more taxes for goods and services just because theyre bought online, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden said in a statement. The legislation, however, fails to address calls for better enforcement of state sales tax collections related to Internet purchases, something that brick-and-mortar businesses have long sought. Separate legislation on this could be considered by Congress later this year, according to Senate aides. Most U.S. states have imposed sales taxes on online purchases, but the actual collection is spotty. ",politicsNews,"February 11, 2016 ",1

George W. Bush to make first appearance for brother Jeb,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican George W. Bush on Monday will seek to generate a fresh burst of enthusiasm for his brother Jeb Bushs White House bid in South Carolina, marking the former presidents first appearance on the campaign trail this year. George W. Bush will appear with his younger brother at a rally in North Charleston, S.C., the Jeb Bush campaign said on Thursday.  The 6 p.m. EST event will be held at the North Charleston Coliseum and Convention Center. The 69-year-old former president is highly popular in the Republican Party, particularly among South Carolina Republicans, who supported his 2000 and 2004 races for president. George W. Bushs decision to go to war in Iraq in 2003 remains a topic of debate in the race to find a successor to President Barack Obama, with Republican front-runner Donald Trump noting that he had opposed the war. Bushs image has improved among Americans in the years since he left office in 2009. A CNN/ORC poll last June found that 52 percent of adults had a favorable impression of him, compared with about a third of Americans when he left office. The Bush campaign believes the ex-president can have a positive impact in South Carolina, which has a sizable number of U.S. military facilities and military veterans who have supported the former commander-in-chief. It will be the most public role George W. Bush has taken to date in his brothers campaign. Jeb Bush, whose father was also president, played down his famous family roots for most of last year in his pursuit of the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, but in need of a boost, he has been relying more heavily on his family ties. His 90-year-old mother, Barbara Bush, campaigned with him last week in New Hampshire. George W. Bush has headlined several private fundraisers for him and reporters were allowed in at one of them, in Houston last October. On Wednesday his voice was heard on a radio ad in South Carolina. We need a strong leader with experience, ideas and resolve. Theres no doubt in my mind that Jeb Bush will be a great commander-in-chief for our military, the former president says in the ad. Jeb Bush has drawn large crowds during his appearances in South Carolina on Wednesday and Thursday after experiencing something of a comeback with a fourth place finish in New Hampshire. He has some ground to make up in South Carolina, however,  with Trump enjoying a big lead there ahead of the Feb. 20 primary vote. President Bush has been incredibly supportive of his brothers campaign and Governor Bush is excited to have him out on the trail, said Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell.

Black U.S. lawmakers group endorses Clinton White House bid,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was endorsed  by the Congressional Black Caucus on Thursday, a much-needed boost to her campaign as it competes for the important black voting bloc in South Carolinas primary this month. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have built strong ties to the African-American community over the past decades. Several lawmakers cited Clintons long history of not only working on issues important to black Americans, but on getting Democrats elected and advancing the partys agenda.  Mrs Clinton has demonstrated her leadership skills. She has labored in various capacities all of her adult life and now she is ready to serve our country by occupying the highest office in our country, said U.S. Representative G.K. Butterfield. The groups backing will be important as Clinton seeks to recover from Tuesdays stinging loss to U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in the New Hampshire primary. Black voters make up a large bloc in the Democratic primary in South Carolina and will be increasingly significant to the Democrats as the presidential contest moves from Iowa and New Hampshire to more demographically diverse states. The Congressional Black Caucus Political Action Committee planned to send a dozen members to South Carolina to campaign for Clinton over the weekend in advance of the states Feb. 27 Democratic primary. Sanders, fresh off his victory in New Hampshire, had breakfast on Wednesday with one of Americas most prominent civil rights activists, Rev. Al Sharpton, recognizing the need to broaden his base to mount a long-term challenge to Clinton. U.S. Representative James Clyburn, an influential African American from South Carolina, declined to make a personal endorsement before the caucus announcement in Washington.  Appearing on CNN Thursday morning, Clyburn praised Sanders voting record and had no criticism of the U.S. senator from Vermont.  But his comments suggested he was leaning toward Clinton, whom he credited with significant contributions to issues important to black Americans, particularly universal access to health care and childrens issues. Butterfield was more pointed in alluding to Sanders, who promises universal health care and free college tuition. We need a president who doesnt simply campaign and just promise wonderful things but things that are politically impossible to achieve, he said at the caucus announcement.

Former Senator Webb rules out independent presidential bid,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Virginia Senator Jim Webb, who dropped his bid for the Democratic Party presidential nomination last October, told a Texas foreign affairs group on Thursday that he had studied an independent bid for the White House and decided against it. We looked at the possibility of an independent candidacy. Theoretically it could be done, but it is enormously costly and time sensitive, and I dont see the fundraising trajectory where we could make a realistic run, Webb told the World Affairs Council of Dallas, according to a statement from his spokesman. In his speech to the council, Webb called for a vigorous foreign policy debate in the presidential campaign and said neither political party appeared to be addressing the needs of most voters. We have not had a clear statement of national security policy since the end of the Cold War, he said. And I see no one running for president today who has a firm understanding of the elements necessary to build a national strategy. Webb is a decorated war veteran who served in the Vietnam War and was Navy secretary during the administration of Republican President Ronald Reagan. He is the author of 10 books and an Emmy award-making journalist and filmmaker.    Webb ended his bid for the Democratic nomination in October after only four months, acknowledging his more conservative political views were out of sync with many of the partys leaders and primary voters. He indicated at the time that he planned to review his options and talk to people and groups who have urged him to run for president as an independent candidate. Ive worked with both parties, including as an official in the Reagan administration and as a Democrat in the Senate. Both parties, in my view, have moved away from the major concerns of the average American, he told the World Affairs Council of Dallas.

Puerto Rico senate approves bill to restructure utility PREPA,"(Reuters) - The Puerto Rico senate has approved the PREPA Revitalization Act, intended to restructure the countrys debt-laden power utility, a spokesmanfor PREPA said.  The bill now moves to the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, which would need to approve it before it could become law. This legislation provides PREPA with critical tools to make PREPA the modern utility that Puerto Rico needs and deserves, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. PREPA, with more than $8 billion in debt, reached a restructuring deal in December with about 70 percent of its creditors.  That deal hit a roadbump in January when Puerto Ricos lawmakers failed to meet a Jan. 22 deadline to pass necessary legislation. However, the agency and bondholders agreed to extend a crucial deadline to Feb. 16. ",politicsNews,"February 11, 2016 ",1
"U.S. can still hit climate goals despite Supreme Court pause, White House says","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House vowed Wednesday that the United States would still meet international commitments to cut carbon emissions, seeking to allay concerns that the Supreme Court might take away one of its main weapons against climate change.   The court dealt a blow on Tuesday to the Obama administrations Clean Power Plan, which would steer electricity plants away from burning coal to cleaner fuel sources, delaying its implementation until all legal challenges are decided.  But the White House said it remained confident it would ultimately win the lawsuits brought by industry groups and 29 states opposed to the plan.  And White House spokesman Eric Schultz said the administration has an array of tools available to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to rising global temperatures. He cited the long-term extension of tax credits for renewable energy that were enacted in last years budget deal as an example of other policy measures driving the power sectors shift to cleaner energy. The inclusion of those tax credits is going to have more impact over the short term than the Clean Power Plan, Schultz said. Still, the court-ordered pause that could push a final legal ruling back a year or more and onto the desk of the next president raised questions about the U.S. ability to deliver on pledges made at Decembers Paris climate talks.  The Paris accord requires countries to set and meet their own national targets to reduce carbon emissions, and the United States presented the Clean Power Plan as a major step to shrink power plant emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels over the next 15 years.  The prospect of a legal delay and possible rejection of the plan rattled some environmental groups and foreign governments that have embraced the Paris formula. Outgoing French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who was praised for his smooth chairmanship that brought about a deal in Paris, was quoted by French government officials saying the Supreme Courts move was not good news. But other observers, noting the endemic gyrations of global climate politics over the past two decades, warned against panic over the courts move. No country naively made an agreement with the United States on the basis of one or two of its policies, said Robert Orr, special adviser on climate change to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The Paris agreement wasnt about what commitments were extracted from one country and whether they can be lived up to, Orr said. It was a recognition by all the major countries that it is in their own best interest to solve this problem. Michelle Patron, formerly a top adviser to Obamas National Security Council on energy and climate issues, said she expected other signatories to the climate deal to take the U.S. news in stride. Our partners are well aware of the legal tests and hurdles that our policies now have to go through, and theyve seen it before, Patron said, describing climate diplomats as having a sophisticated level of knowledge about the U.S. political system. Market reaction seemed to reflect a similar long view. Coal companies have blamed clean air regulations for the collapse of much of the domestic industry in recent years, even though much of the power sectors shift from coal to natural gas has been driven by low prices for the latter.  Coal stocks rose quickly in early trading Wednesday after the courts move. But after jumping nearly 7 percent early in the session, the Thomson Reuters U.S. coal index was down 3 percent in afternoon trading, reflecting the deeply ingrained skepticism about the long-term prospects for coal. Whenever you get a rally in these stocks initially its from short-covering that helps propel the stock, said King Lip, chief investment officer at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco. But people start realizing its still very difficult for a lot of these companies because theyre so leveraged. They come back to Earth and the selling starts to pick up again. Thats what you saw today with some of these coal stocks. ",politicsNews,"February 11, 2016 ",1
"Despite carbon ruling, White House says U.S. can meet climate deal goals","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House promised on Wednesday that it would be able to uphold U.S. commitments to an international climate change agreement, as a court ruling heightened concerns about the stability of the global carbon reduction pact reached last year. Shares of coal companies reflected the uncertainty the day after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling. After jumping nearly 7 percent early in the session, the Thomson Reuters U.S. coal index was down 3 percent in afternoon trading.  The court dealt a serious blow to the Obama administrations climate change agenda on Tuesday when it took the unusual step to delay implementation of the Clean Power Plan until legal challenges to the regulation are completed. A centerpiece of the Obama administrations climate change policy, the Clean Power Plan was designed to lower carbon emissions from U.S. power plants by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels.  The decision to temporarily block the rule came after the United States entered into a landmark agreement in December with countries around the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While the Clean Power Plan was expected to be the main tool for the United States to fulfill its part of the pact, White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters in a briefing that it was only one part of the nations response to climate change. The long-term extension of the tax credits for renewable energy last year will continue to provide momentum that will transition the power sector toward cleaner sources of energy, Schultz said. The inclusion of those tax credits is going to have more impact over the short term than the Clean Power Plan, he said. But French government spokesman Stephane Le Foll quoted outgoing Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius as saying after a cabinet meeting that the decision was not good news, even if the debate will continue in the United States.  Claudia Salerno, a Venezuelan diplomat who leads the countrys delegation at U.N. climate talks, described the ruling as truly damaging to the outcome of the pact in a Twitter message late on Tuesday.

High court emissions ruling won't deter clean energy drive ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. power sectors shift toward burning less coal and using more natural gas and renewable energy will not be derailed by the Supreme Court ruling against the Obama administrations limits on carbon emissions, state regulators and utilities said on Wednesday. The U.S. Supreme Court decided 5-4 on Tuesday to block the Environmental Protection Agencys carbon emissions crackdown on coal plants until a legal challenge is resolved.  Some states may now slow work on compliance with the EPAs Clean Power Plan. But some experts said they were confident the rule will survive the legal challenge when the D.C. circuit court makes a decision this summer.  In a way we are really just postponing the inevitable, said Vicki Arroyo, executive director of the Georgetown Climate Center. Even in some of the 27 states that sued to block the rule, officials had been working on compliance plans.  Most states said they will continue to decarbonize their energy supply. Utilities across the country have already begun a major shift away from coal-fired electricity toward cleaner burning and cheaper natural gas and renewables like wind and solar. We fully expect that many of these states will continue their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under their own legal authorities, said Bill Becker, director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies. States like California, Colorado and New York criticized the high courts decision and vowed to pursue their plans to shift to cleaner energy regardless of the delay in the EPA rule. Meanwhile, states like Montana and North Dakota that joined in the lawsuit against the EPA welcomed the breathing room the stay provides. But even these opponents of the rule said they will keep diversifying their power supply. Colorados Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper said the state will keep working on compliance so it is not left at a disadvantage if the courts uphold all or part of the Clean Power Plan. Colorado challenged the EPA plan even though the governor supports it. The states Republican attorney general disagrees about the legality of the rule and its economic impact. Montana Governor Steve Bullock, a Democrat, opposed the EPA rule. He said the state would put on hold the work of a group to devise compliance options, but added that it still needs to address climate change and embrace Montanas energy future. He said: I am committed to ensuring we do so on our own terms.   For coal-producing North Dakota, which had one of the highest emission reduction targets to meet under the rule, regulators and utilities will keep working on ways to lower power plant emissions, said state health department chief Dave Glatt.  He said the EPA plan did not give the state a sufficient amount of time to have reasonable solutions. He pledged to look at reasonable steps forward. For most states, coal-fired electricity has been in decline. In 2015, generators shut over 15,000 megawatts of coal-fired power plants, the most in any year, as low gas prices drove down power costs. It became uneconomical to overhaul older coal plants even to meet existing federal clean air rules.  Ohio regulators said Wednesday they were not sure how the state will respond to the court decision, but the states major utilities are already shifting away from coal. American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP.N) will continue generating more power with natural gas and renewable energy since prices for those have dropped significantly, said spokeswoman Melissa McHenry. She added that the five-year extension of federal renewable energy tax credits has given AEP an incentive to bring more renewable energy into the mix. It makes sense that we are sticking to our current plans, and will be positioned to respond to the courts ultimate decision on the future of the Clean Power Plan, she said. Another Ohio utility, FirstEnergy Corp (FE.N), said it already retired a number of older coal plants in 2012. The court decision will have little impact. The Supreme Court decision does not change the path we are on, said spokeswoman Jennifer Young. We think it is the right thing to do  this is a complicated issue and this decision will give the states the appropriate amount of time to develop their compliance plans.

Trump shows his presidential bid is no mere publicity stunt,"MANCHESTER, N.H. (Reuters) - Donald Trump served notice on Tuesday to those who have refused to take his 2016 White House campaign seriously: The celebrity real-estate developer and former reality show host is no joke.  While Trump had been expected to win New Hampshires nominating contest, he swamped the Republican field by almost 20 points, demonstrating that his passionate, anti-establishment supporters could be relied on to show up and vote when it counts. Its a monumental win for Donald Trump, said Michael Dennehy, a Republican strategist in Concord, New Hampshire, who is unaffiliated with any campaign. The message is being sent loud and clear that Republicans want to throw Washington on its head. Trump still has a long road ahead. He suffers from high unfavorability ratings and is often an undisciplined candidate who invites controversy with his policies and insults, going so far this week as to repeat an audience members assertion that U.S. Senator Ted Cruz was a pussy. Yet after finishing second in the Iowa caucuses last week and now first in New Hampshire, Trump can take solace in the fact that rarely is the ultimate nominee from eitherparty not one of the top two finishers in Iowa or New Hampshire.  Since Iowa began holding the first-in-the-nation caucus in 1976, no Republican has finished second there and first in New Hampshire and failed to win the nomination. The two states are the first of the state-by-state nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. In New Hampshire, Trump, at least for the moment, put to rest questions over whether his strong showing in polls was illusory, after he underperformed them last week in Iowa. His immediate prospects were further helped by the failure of any of the establishment candidates to emerge as a clear challenger. Taken together, the mainstream candidates pulled in enough votes to overcome Trump. But no single one came close to him and there are few signs of a major consolidation anytime soon.  The victory by Trump here has the makings of a major disaster for the establishment, said Ford OConnell, a Republican strategist.  The candidate who had been widely viewed as Trumps biggest threat, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, suffered deep wounds in New Hampshire after a strong showing in Iowa that some pundits believed would propel him to the top ranks of the establishment Republicans. After stumbling badly in a debate on Saturday, the man who had been considered by many in the party as its best hope to retake the White House finished deep in the middle of the pack.  Rubios disastrous showing shifted the landscape of the entire campaign, Dennehy said. He added he had conversations with many undecided voters in recent days who liked Rubio but changed their support to other candidates after the debate.  The Republican nomination race now bends southward, with a primary in South Carolina on Feb. 20 the next test. Trump has held a double-digit lead there for months. After South Carolina comes Nevada, and then a spate of Southern states on March 1. All provide Trump with the chance to consolidate his support before any other candidate amasses enough delegates to pose a real threat. His toughest opponent in those states will likely be Cruz, the Texas lawmaker who won in Iowa and whose insurgent candidacy is equally worrisome to the Republican establishment.  But Trump appeared in New Hampshire to learn from some of the mistakes his campaign made in Iowa. In recent days, he combined the large-scale rallies for which he has become known with more intimate affairs, an apparent effort to address criticism he was not devoting enough focus to retail campaigning.  Trump also returned to the populist themes that have characterized his campaign and made him an atypical front-runner for the Republican nomination. He ripped U.S. corporations for sending jobs overseas and repeatedly slammed the pharmaceutical industry for charging high prices on prescription drugs and the health insurance industry for consistently hiking rates.  His campaign showed more of an ability to reach voters who may not have otherwise engaged in the political process. Typical were Marjorie Callicutt, 64, and her husband, Fred, 74, who attended a Trump event in tiny Plymouth, New Hampshire, on Sunday. The couple said they would not have been there if the Trump campaign had not called them the day before to tell them about the rally. Both said they had been persuaded to vote for him. He woke up the country, Fred Callicutt said. He says things that nobody wants to talk about.

Senate unanimously backs tougher North Korea sanctions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted unanimously on Wednesday to toughen sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear program, human rights record and cyber activities, as U.S. lawmakers sought to crack down on Pyongyang for its nuclear tests. The House of Representatives passed a similar bill last month. Differences between the two are expected to be resolved quickly and Senate Democrats said they expected President Barack Obama would sign the measure into law. The White House has not threatened a veto, but a spokesman told reporters he did not have a response to the bill. Lawmakers said they wanted to make Washingtons resolve clear not just to Pyongyang, but to the United Nations and other governments, especially China, North Koreas lone major ally and main business partner. The Senate vote for the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act was 96-0. Backing for the bill was so strong that two Republicans vying to be their partys 2016 presidential nominee, Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, both left the campaign trail to vote. Senator Bernie Sanders, a Democratic contender, missed the vote. China, the very entity that could do something about this, is blocking the U.N. Security Councils action toward this being done on a multilateral basis, said Republican Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It will be much more effective if we can get the international community to support us, said Senator Ben Cardin, the panels top Democrat. He drew parallels to U.S. sanctions that became multilateral regimes against Iran and South Africa. Congress has been clamoring for a clampdown since Pyongyang tested a nuclear device in January. Its weekend satellite launch fueled the calls. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told the Senate on Tuesday that North Korea has followed through on plans to re-start a plutonium production reactor and could begin to assemble a plutonium stockpile within months. The Senate bill would sanction anyone who engages in, facilitates or contributes to North Koreas proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, arms-related materials, luxury goods, human rights abuses, activities undermining cyber security and the provision of materials for such activities. Penalties include the seizure of assets, visa bans and denial of government contracts. Unusually, the measure makes most of the sanctions mandatory, rather than giving the president the option to impose them. He can temporarily waive them by making the case that doing so would threaten national security. ",politicsNews,"February 10, 2016 ",1
"McCain presses U.S. Air Force, Pentagon over Russian engines","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday increased pressure on the Pentagon and the Air Force, demanding answers over the continued use of Russian rocket engines for U.S. satellite launches. Senator John McCain, in a letter dated Feb. 10 seen by Reuters, asked Air Force Secretary Deborah James and Pentagon chief arms buyer Frank Kendall to explain why the U.S. government is continuing to deal with NPO Energomash, the Russian firm that builds Russian RD-180 rocket engines.  McCain pressed the officials on the legality of doing business with NPO Energomash given sanctions in place against Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin and others, who now have control over the company after a recent reorganization.      McCain also questioned the Air Forces continued payment of a large launch support contract to United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co, despite the presence of a certified competitor, Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX. McCain said he wants answers to these questions by February 22.  James pledged to respond to the questions during a January hearing, but McCain said he followed up in writing to underscore his concerns about what he has described as subsidies to Russian leader Vladimir Putin and his gang of corrupt cronies. Congress banned use of the Russian RD-180 rocket engines for military use after Russia annexed Ukraines Crimea region in 2014. But U.S. lawmakers weakened the ban late last year, worried that it could drive ULA out of business and leave just privately-held SpaceX, to lift satellites into space. James and other officials have urged Congress to allow use of the Russian engines that power ULAs Atlas 5 rocket for several years until alternatives are available in several years.  In his letter, McCain asked the U.S. and Air Force to explain what options they had to penalize ULA for not bidding in a recent launch competition despite receiving launch support of $800 million to $1 billion a year since 2006. He also asked the department to examine what percentage of that annual support contract was associated with ULAs other family of rockets, the Delta 4, which the company plans to retire since it is more costly than the Atlas 5. McCain and other senators argue that it would be worth the extra cost to end U.S. reliance on the Russian engines.     ",politicsNews,"February 10, 2016 ",1
White House says opposes House bill on restaurant calories,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Wednesday it opposes a bill from the U.S. House of Representatives that it said would undercut regulations aimed at requiring fast food and chain restaurants to disclose the calories in food they sell. But the White House stopped short of issuing a formal veto threat for the bill, which it said would undercut the objective of providing clear, consistent calorie information to consumers. Tackling the American obesity epidemic has been a signature issue for the White House and first lady Michelle Obama. The menu regulations, finalized by the Food and Drug Administration in 2014, require calories to be listed on menus and menu boards of certain chain restaurants with 20 or more locations, and on certain vending machines.

House passes bill requiring EPA actions on lead-laced water,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday easily passed a bill requiring federal environmental regulators to act faster when lead contamination is found in drinking water.   The bill passed 416-2. It was crafted by Michigan Representatives Dan Kildee, a Democrat, and Fred Upton, a Republican, in the wake of Flints drinking water crisis. The measure requires the Environmental Protection Agency to notify the public when concentrations of lead in drinking water rise above mandated levels and to create a plan to improve communication between the agency, utilities, states, and consumers.  In 2014, under a state-appointed emergency manager, Flint, a city of 100,000, switched water supplies to the Flint River, from Detroits system as part of a plan to save money in the poverty-stricken city. The more corrosive river water leached lead from aging pipes. Thousands of children are believed to have ingested dangerous levels of lead, a toxin that can harm brains and cause other health problems. The bill wouldnt have prevented Flint, but it would have caught it far sooner, Kildee, who is from Flint, said after the vote. The measure must be passed by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama before becoming law.  Other measures in Congress to provide Flint with millions of dollars in aid to deal with the crisis face an uncertain future. Kildee has also introduced a bill to provide about $700 million in federal aid, with a match in funding from Michigan. That and other measures languished as Democrats and Republicans struggled to agree on where the funds would come from.  The Department of Agriculture said on Thursday it would temporarily allow Michigan to use funds from its Women, Infants and Children program for low income citizens to conduct lead testing. The department estimated some 3,800 people could get tested in this way. ",politicsNews,"February 10, 2016 ",1
"In Illinois homecoming, Obama calls for improved tone in U.S. politics","SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama paid a nostalgic visit on Wednesday to the place that launched his political career and made a renewed call for better relations between Republicans and Democrats to create a more positive tone in U.S. politics. Obama won the White House in 2008 partially on a promise to overcome partisan divides in Washington. He has called his failure to do that, seven years after taking office, a regret. On the ninth anniversary of his 2007 announcement in Springfield that he was running for president, Obama addressed Illinois lawmakers at the state Capitol where he once worked as a state senator in what he described as a collegial, friendly atmosphere. I was able to be part of that here, and yet I couldnt translate it the way I wanted to in our politics in Washington, he said. Obama said reducing the influence of money, making it easier to vote and ending the way voting districts were drawn politically would help solve the problem.  Weve got to build a better politics, he said. When I hear voices in either party boast of their refusal to compromise as an accomplishment in and of itself, Im not impressed. Congressional Republicans have said the Democratic president is often unwilling to work with them to pass legislation. The central premise of the Obama presidency was to unite the country, and thats been an unquestionable failure, Doug Andres, a spokesman for Republican Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Paul Ryan, said in a statement.  Obama has made clear he views Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trumps rhetoric as corrosive. Trump, who has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, won the New Hampshire Republican primary on Tuesday as the parties hold state-by-state nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election to succeed Obama. The chamber in which Obama addressed Illinois lawmakers also became a microcosm of the challenges he was hoping to address. Democrats stood and clapped when Obama said the country was better off since he became president. Republicans stayed seated. The situation was similar to what occurred at his annual State of the Union addresses in Washington.  Obama chided both sides, however, and said he believed Republicans shared some of his values even if they disagreed on how to enact them. He noted the importance of basic governance such as fixing roads and passing budgets, a reference to a crisis facing his home state.  Republican Governor Bruce Rauner has refused to sign a spending plan for Illinois 2016 fiscal year without winning Democratic concessions that would weaken collective bargaining rights for public-sector unions, impose term limits, freeze property taxes and make it harder for workers injured on the job to collect damages from their employers. Democrats, who control both of Illinois legislative chambers, have resisted his demands, setting up a stalemate that has left the states public universities and social-service programs starved for funding. Chicago State University, for example, last week declared a financial emergency, and furloughs have been imposed at other public universities. Obamas trip was aimed both at solidifying his legacy in a familiar place and making good on a promise to spend his last year working toward healing partisan wounds. Shortly after arriving, he stopped at a restaurant he frequented as a state senator, then shook hands with onlookers outside the Old State Capitol, where Obama announced his bid for the White House exactly nine years ago.

Obama plan to ease new U.S. visa limits faces skeptics in Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obamas plan to loosen some requirements of a visa law spurred by the deadly attacks in Paris met with open resistance from both Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Congress on Wednesday. The measure, which went into effect in late January, requires that citizens of 38 countries who previously were able to travel to the United States for up to 90 days without a visa must now obtain one if they have visited Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria since March 1, 2011. Ed Royce, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on Wednesday said he wanted to add Libya to the list of countries covered by the restrictions. At a hearing of the House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee, lawmakers voiced particular concern over exempting from the new visa clamp-down some travelers who visit Iran, including those conducting business. Nowhere does the law include this authority. In fact, Congress explicitly rejected the waivers requested by theWhite House, Chairman Michael McCaul, a Republican, said. Lawmakers enacted the visa restrictions on fears that travelers from the mainly European countries in the Visa Waiver Program could easily travel to the United States even if they have, for example, visited countries like Syria, Iran or Iraq, where militants are active. The Nov. 13 attacks in Paris stirred fears about such travel. Some of the Islamic State attackers who killed 130 people that day held European passports that would have allowed them easy entry to the United States. Representative Bennie Thompson, the Homeland Security Committees top Democrat, echoedRepublican concerns about Obamasannounced plan to allow visa waivers for foreign business people who travel to Iran. I have some questions about how the (Department of Homeland Security) would go about determining the legitimacy of the business-related purposes,he said. Administration officials countered that they wanted to shield journalists, humanitarian aid workers and employees of other international organizations, as well as business people helping economic reconstruction efforts in Iran and Iraq in particular, from the tougher requirements. Individuals must qualify for the Visa Waiver Program, with background checks against U.S. counter-terrorism and law enforcement databases. State Department counter-terrorism official Hillary Johnson told the committee there are regular reviews of those who are approved. Gil Kerlikowski, U.S. Customs and Border Protection commissioner, told the committee an estimated 500,000 people who come into the country under the waiver program have overstayed their visas. He said he did not know how many of them might have traveled to Iran, Iraq, Syria or Sudan. Administration officials expressed concern that if the United States fails to loosen some of the new restrictions, foreign governments might cut back on information sharing, or impose awkward new visa requirements on Americans who travel to their countries.

Ohio House passes bill to deny funds to Planned Parenthood,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Ohio state legislators on Wednesday passed a bill blocking state and federal funds for groups that perform or promote abortions, effectively cutting $1.3 million annually used by Planned Parenthood clinics for HIV testing, pre-natal care and other programs. Governor John Kasich, a Republican presidential candidate, is expected to sign the bill, which the state Senate had already passed. House Bill 294, which passed 59 to 32, blocks womens health providers that also provide abortions, or groups that refer patients to those providers, from receiving funds from a variety of state and federal grants.  Planned Parenthood said the bill would hinder lower-income womens access to testing for sexually transmitted diseases, HIV tests and well-baby programs. According to its website, Planned Parenthood has 20 clinics in Ohio. Two provide abortions and all provide abortion referral. With most Republicans keen to deny funds to Planned Parenthood, Kasich will have the opportunity to sign the bill ahead of the partys presidential primary on Feb. 20 in South Carolina. Joe Andrews, spokesman for Kasich, said the bill furthers Ohios policies. The Ohio Department of Health had already stopped awarding state dollars to Planned Parenthood and they were kicked to the back of the line for the federal governments family planning grants that the department administers. This bill further reinforces Ohios policies, Andrews said Wednesday. Opponents of the bill accused state Republicans of grandstanding, noting that the timing of its passage was convenient for Kasich as he campaigns in a crowded field for nomination to represent his party in the November election.  Theres no legitimate justification for defunding Planned Parenthood. Every excuse by legislators has been debunked, Kellie Copeland executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, an abortion rights advocacy group, said on Wednesday. Clearly the motivation behind the content and timing of this legislation is to bolster John Kasichs campaign to anti-choice voters in SouthCarolina, Copeland added. Proponents of the bill said the funding transfer will help combat infant mortality because it re-directs $250,000 for new parent education. Under Ohio law no state funds are used to provide abortions but state funds are used by Planned Parenthood to provide other healthcare. Rep. Kathleen Clyde, a Democrat, said the bill would be counterproductive. It will likely increase the number of abortions in Ohio by cutting access to birth control and access to sex education in Ohio, she said. ",politicsNews,"February 10, 2016 ",1
Embattled Pennsylvania attorney general survives Senate removal vote,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (Reuters) - Republican state senators in Pennsylvania failed to muster enough votes on Wednesday to oust Attorney General Kathleen Kane, who is facing criminal charges for allegedly leaking secret grand jury material. All but one of the Senates 30 Republicans voted to remove Kane, a Democrat, from office because her law license has been suspended, falling four votes short of the two-thirds majority required. The chambers 18 Democrats, as well as one Republican, opposed the move. It is simply not appropriate to take this action, said Senator Judy Schwank, a Democrat who served on the committee that examined Kanes removal. It is an outrage against voters right to choose their elected officials. Kane has been in legal hot water ever since her indictment last summer for allegedly passing grand jury information to a reporter as part of a personal feud. The Pennsylvania SupremeCourt suspended her law license last fall. Wednesdays debate in the Senate focused on whether Kane could continue to function as attorneygeneral without a license to practice law. Unlike impeachment, which targets officeholders who have committed crimes and requires action by both legislative chambers, removal is aimed at incompetent but law-abiding officials and requires onlySenate action. The process had not been used since 1891. When you have a suspended law license, you cannot do anything! said Senator John Gordner, the Republican who chaired the removal committee, during Wednesdays three-hour debate. But others, notably Democratic former Governor Edward Rendell, who served eight years as district attorney of Philadelphia, previously testified at hearings that a license was not essential. Rendell said that in a large district attorney office, the job is mainly about making managerial decisions, not practicing law. Kane has claimed her indictment was brought in response to her efforts to release thousands of explicit or offensive e-mails circulated by former prosecutors in her office, including those who prosecuted Penn State sexual predator Jerry Sandusky, and two members of the state Supreme Court, among others. Today is a good day for all those who share my desire to restore confidence in our judges and prosecutors and integrity to our system of justice, Kane said in a statement after the vote. She could still face removal efforts. The state House of Representatives voted separately on Wednesday to begin an impeachment inquiry, while Senate Republicans used a procedural maneuver that allows them to call for another removal vote if circumstances change.

New York City budget boss to state: We're not a 'piggy bank',"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Citys fiscal watchdog said the city faces much bigger budget deficits in coming years than the mayor has forecast and warned state lawmakers about treating the city like a piggy bank. The state, like the city, is finalizing its budget and will soon make decisions affecting New York City. Some upstate legislators just dont get it, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer said during his review of the city budget on Wednesday. They see New York City as their piggy bank.  Stringer cautioned against last-minute, late-night budget decisions that could deprive the city of resources. His comments reflected growing frustration with state lawmakers over their suggestions that the city is flush with cash after a stronger economic recovery than other parts of the state. New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo has had a tense relationship with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, persuading his fellow Democrat last year to pay $2.5 billion toward the citys public transportation system, which is run by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a state agency. There have also been suggestions in the state capital that the city could do more to fund healthcare costs and pay more for the citys university system. New York State legislators are known for vampire budget sessions that go into the early hours to beat the budget deadline at the start of the states fiscal year on April 1. Stringer said that although next years budget remained balanced, the total gaps forecast through fiscal year 2020 are $1 billion more than the mayors office had predicted. Budget monitors and rating agencies have all applauded this administrations fiscal prudence and focus on protecting against economic uncertainty  and investors agree, said Amy Spitalnick, a spokesperson for de Blasio.  The mayors office points out that Stringer projects $900 million in additional tax revenue for this financial year and next, and cites that as an example of cautious revenue projections on the citys part. Stringer said the mayor should not have included $731 million from the sale of taxi medallions through 2020, saying the taxi business is currently in upheaval. The city has already cut it expectations for revenue from taxi medallion sales but Stringer has been more aggressive in elimintaing it from later years. He also said some taxes would be lower than the mayor is predicting and that costs for overtime, healthcare and homeless shelters would be higher. ",politicsNews,"February 10, 2016 ",1
U.S. can meet Paris climate deal goals despite court ruling: White House,"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - The White House said on Wednesday that it was confident it could meet its obligations under the Paris climate change agreement, despite a court ruling temporarily blocking the administrations limits on power plants carbon emissions. The U.S. Supreme Court dealt a serious blow to the Obama administrations climate change agenda on Tuesday when it took the unusual step to delay implementation of the Clean Power Plan until legal challenges to the regulation are completed. The Clean Power Plan was designed to lower carbon emissions from U.S. power plants by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels.  While the plan was expected to be the main tool for the United States to meet climate goals agreed to in an international deal in December, White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters in a briefing that it was only one part of the nations response to climate change. The long-term extension of the tax credits for renewable energy last year will continue to provide momentum that will transition the power sector toward cleaner sources of energy, Schultz said. The inclusion of those tax credits is going to have more impact over the short term than the Clean Power Plan, he said. Schultz said the administration was in talks with its partners in the deal and that diplomats in those countries understood the complexities of establishing policies in the United States.  He also said he expected that litigation involving the Clean Power Plan to be wrapped up in time for the United States to comply with the climate agreement.   ",politicsNews,"February 10, 2016 ",1
"Republicans Christie, Fiorina drop White House bids","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former business executive Carly Fiorina ended their presidential campaigns on Wednesday, narrowing the field challenging front-runner Donald Trump in the race for the 2016 Republican nomination. Christie, 53, said in a Facebook post he was leaving the race without an ounce of regret, a day after the combative Republicans sixth-place finish in the New Hampshire primary raised doubts about his viability as a candidate.  Fiorina, 61, a former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, said in a Facebook post she would suspend her campaign. The only woman in the Republican field placed seventh in New Hampshire, one of a series of state-by-state nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. Trumps remaining opponents, most of them mainstream Republicans, will likely benefit from their departures, which leave seven Republicans from a field that once had 17 candidates. Trump won the New Hampshire Republican primary by almost 20 points. The fifth-place finish of U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who had hoped to emerge as Trumps main rival after a surprise third-place showing in Iowa last week, leaves Trump without a clear challenger among the so-called establishment candidates.  On the Democratic side, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a democratic socialist, easily defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the New Hampshire primary. The victories in both parties by candidates considered outsiders, testified to the sizable share of American voters upset over the slow economic recovery, immigration and Americas place in the world and who are willing to shake up Washington.  Trump, 69, a billionaire businessman, has a double-digit lead over conservative Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in opinion polls for the next Republican contest, the South Carolina primary on Feb. 20, according to a Real Clear Politics average of opinion polls. Christie poured much of his campaigns resources into New Hampshire and had considered a good showing there critical. He won only about 7 percent of votes on Tuesday, despite a pugnacious performance at a Republican debate last weekend. Christie needed to drop out. In short, he does not have the money or organization to be viable in South Carolina and beyond, said Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray. Christie was certainly hurt by Trump stealing his telling it like it is thunder, but Christie was also out-organized in the ultimate retail politics state, Murray said. SANDERS COURTS AFRICAN-AMERICANS Trumps victory in New Hampshire showed pundits were wrong to think he would quickly self-destruct based on his penchant for insults and imprecise plans for the presidency. He had lost last week to Cruz in the first nominating contest, the Iowa caucuses. Ohios Republican governor, John Kasich, finished second in New Hampshire, followed by Cruz, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Rubio. The odds of Trump winning the White House, once seen as an extremely long shot, improved significantly after his victory in New Hampshire, online betting site Ladbrokes PLC said. Trump is now at 9/2, compared with 7/1 last week, meaning his chances of victory in November are now 18 percent. Clinton still had the best odds of becoming president at 50/50, Ladbrokes said. On the Democratic side, Sanders, 74, courted the African-American vote on Wednesday, having breakfast with civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton at a restaurant in New York Citys Harlem neighborhood. Clinton, 68, currently has strong support from black voters, who will be crucial in the Democratic primary in South Carolina on Feb. 27.  Sharpton and Obama met at the same restaurant during Obamas successful 2008 presidential campaign - a piece of symbolism for Sanders as he tries to expand his appeal beyond liberals in the U.S. Northeast. My concern is that in January of next year for the first time in American history, a black family will be moving out of the White House, Sharpton, a Baptist minister and television talk-show host, told reporters afterward. I do not want black concerns to be moved out with them. We must be front and center and not marginalized. And Senator Sanders coming here this morning further makes it clear that we will not be ignored, he said. Sharpton discussed a spate of police shootings of black males and other issues with the senator. Sharpton said he would not endorse a candidate until he met with Clinton. The Congressional Black Caucus will endorse Clinton on Thursday and its members will be active in supporting her campaign, the Washington Post reported, citing U.S. Democratic Representative Gregory Meeks of New York, chairman of CBCs political action committee. Clinton has a long history of support for civil rights. She also has benefited from husband Bill Clintons popularity in the black community during his presidency, although that became strained during her fierce 2008 primary battle with Obama. Clintons campaign, highlighting her popularity among black and Latino voters, said in a statement on Tuesday: It will be very difficult, if not impossible, for a Democrat to win the nomination without strong levels of support among African-American and Hispanic voters.

A breakfast in Harlem underscores key challenge for White House hopeful Sanders,"MANCHESTER, N.H. (Reuters) - Bernie Sanders had breakfast with one of Americas most prominent civil rights activists, Al Sharpton, just hours after trouncing Hillary Clinton in the New Hampshire Democratic presidential nominating contest. The meeting marked a recognition by Sanders that his campaign must swiftly broaden its base of support if he has any chance of mounting a long-term challenge to Clinton, who consistently polls better among African American voters. They will play a crucial role in the Democratic race as it moves to South Carolina - where more than half of the Democratic primary voters in 2008 were African American - and other states more diverse than New Hampshire or Iowa, which held the first contest of the 2016 election. Sanders met Sharpton in the same Harlem restaurant where the activist met with Barack Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign - an obvious bit of symbolism for the Vermont senator trying to connect with minority voters. My concern is that in January of next year for the first time in American history a black family will be moving out of the White House. I do not want black concerns to be moved out with them, Sharpton, a Baptist minister and television talk show host, told reporters afterwards. Sharpton discussed a recent spate of police shootings of black males and other issues with the senator. He said he would not endorse a candidate until he met with Clinton. Even before the exit polls showing that Sanders had won New Hampshire, Clintons campaign was already trying to highlight  her double-digit lead over Sanders among African American and Latino voters. It will be very difficult, if not impossible, for a Democrat to win the nomination without strong levels of support among African American and Hispanic voters, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said in a memo sent to reporters. He predicted the Democratic race would be won in March, when it quickly expands to 22 delegate-rich states with some of the largest minority and urban populations  and that Clinton would have the advantage.  Clinton has a long history of support for civil rights, and she has benefited from her husband Bill Clintons popularity in the black community during his presidency, although that became strained during the fierce 2008 primary battle with Obama. Reuters/Ipsos polling nationally showed that in January, blacks backed Clinton by a margin of 3 to 1 over Sanders. Among Hispanics, 48 percent supported Clinton and 32 percent backed Sanders. But as black and Hispanic voters became more familiar with Sanders through televised presidential debates, they seemed to like him more, with his favorability ratings rising slightly among those groups over the last few months, the polling showed. So far Sanders strong performance has been due to the mostly young white voters who have embraced his populist anti-Wall Street message and call for income equality. But in the upcoming nominating contests, Sanders needs to carry that message to a broader group of voters, particularly minority voters, who will help determine the Democratic nominee. African Americans and Hispanics comprise 35 percent of the Democratic party, according to a 2013 Gallup poll. Sanders already has intensified his efforts to reach black voters with more campaign stops before African-American audiences and ads on black-oriented radio stations. Rapper Killer Mike sometimes introduces Sanders at rallies, and academic Cornel West has also campaigned for him. The senator also frequently condemns the disproportionate rate at which blacks are targeted by police and has called for increased police transparency and accountability. Sanders intensified effort to appeal to minority voters follows questions about whether he has broad enough support to take the White House. Clinton herself has raised the issue of Sanders electability on the campaign trail and in debates. Even some Sanders supporters have expressed fears that a vote for him could allow Republicans to win the election.  But Sanders campaign shrugs off any worries about the road ahead. We recognize we are moving to a bigger stage, but its another opportunity for him to spread his message. People have responded to his message when they hear it, said Sanders campaign spokesman Michael Briggs. Sanders already has begun airing ads in Nevada and South Carolina, has hired staff in 15 states and is prepared for a national race, Briggs said. On Super Tuesday, Sanders will be looking to do well in several states, including his home state of Vermont, as well as Massachusetts, Colorado and Minnesota, where the grassroots enthusiasm of his supporters could be an advantage. Still Irene Matz, a retiree in Minneapolis, Minnesota, said she was worried about Sanders electability and had yet to make a decision on who to vote for. Hillary has been hit with everything for years, we know what we are getting with her. Now Bernie will get his turn, and they wont be kind to him, Matz said. Ill vote for Hillary unless I feel Bernie has a good shot, she said.  (Additional reporting by Chris Kahn and Alana Wise, editing by Paul Thomasch and Ross Colvin) SAP is the sponsor of this content.

Republican Christie assesses future of White House bid,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Chris Christie considered the future of his struggling U.S. presidential bid on Wednesday amid news reports he would suspend his campaign and narrow the field of rivals facing businessman Donald Trump. A disappointing sixth-place finish in Tuesdays New Hampshire nominating contest raised doubts about the combative New Jersey governors viability as a candidate for the Nov. 8 presidential election. The Wall Street Journal quoted a senior adviser to the campaign as saying Christie was expected to make an announcement soon suspending his campaign. Other news organizations carried similar reports. A spokeswoman for Christies campaign said no decision had been made about whether he would stay in the race. Christies departure would leave eight Republicans from a field that once had 17 candidates vying to represent the party. Trump has dominated the Republican race and won the party primary in New Hampshire on a wave of voter anger at traditional U.S. politicians. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a democratic socialist, defeated former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the states Democratic contest.      The results testified to the sizable share of American voters upset over the slow economic recovery, immigration and Americas place in the world and willing to send a shockwave to Washington.  On Wednesday, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said he understood the frustration and expected Republican voters to coalesce behind a candidate. I think its pretty normal and I think its pretty common and expect that sort of vein is going to play itself out for the next few months and you know well have a unified party when its done, he told CNN in an interview. Christie had poured much of his campaigns resources into New Hampshire and had considered a good showing there critical. He canceled plans to go to South Carolina, a sign he could drop out soon. The southern state holds the next Republican primary on Feb. 20. No decision has been made, Christie spokeswoman Sam Smith wrote in an email to Reuters.          Trumps opponents, most of them mainstream Republicans, could benefit if Christie pulls out. Ohios Republican governor, John Kasich, finished second in New Hampshire, followed by U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. For Trump, New Hampshire showed he has staying power and can take a punch after losing last week to U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the first nominating contest, the Iowa caucuses. The former reality TV stars win showed pundits were wrong to think he would quickly self-destruct based on his penchant for insults and imprecise plans for the presidency.    Trumps odds for winning the White House, once seen as an extremely long shot, improved significantly after his victory in New Hampshire, online betting site Ladbrokes PLC LAD.L said. The real estate tycoon is now at 9/2, compared to 7/1 last week, meaning that his chances of victory in November are now 18 percent.

Republicans' feud threatens to reignite fiscal battles,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior House Republican warned on Wednesday that differences among lawmakers over a spending increase could threaten plans for a more orderly budget process under House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has been basking in a honeymoon period. The comments from House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers came as Ryan was facing the first big challenge of his speakership, with some conservatives wanting to back out of a deal made last year increasing spending by $80 billion over two years. Many Republicans did not vote for the two-year budget framework negotiated in former Speaker John Boehners waning days in office. Ryan was elected to replace him late in October. Conservative veterans of past budget battles see little reason why they should now support a budget for fiscal 2017 that incorporates the spending hike. The new number isnt something that I could vote for unless I have a compelling reason to do so, and I havent been given that reason, said Representative Matt Salmon, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. Democrats are unlikely to welcome changes to the fiscal deal, especially cuts, and could leave Ryan only fellow-Republicans to negotiate with on a new plan. Rogers warned that if the House tries to change the deal, the Senate might balk, which could ultimately lead to the need to pass a massive omnibus spending bill to fund the entire government. So weve got to consider carefully what we do here, Rogers said after a Republican caucus. An omnibus would be the opposite of the better-functioning appropriations process Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, also a Republican, seek this election year. They want Congress to pass a dozen separate spending bills  instead of voting on one huge piece of legislation that, if it fails, results in a government shutdown. The first move would normally be for the House to pass a budget blueprint, which leaders hope to do soon. Rogers thought lawmakers could deem a budget resolution as having passed already because of last years deal. But such a procedural workaround could upset conservatives. Some Senate Republicans are also wondering where the votes will come from to pass a budget resolution embracing higher spending levels. Congress already agreed (to the spending numbers) and did the tough choice of raising spending, a senior Senate Republican aide said. Why put our members who are in-cycle (up for re-election this year) through this again? ",politicsNews,"February 10, 2016 ",1
No love lost with Daily News after Trump wins New Hampshire,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and the New York Daily News are not clowning around. Trump fired back on Twitter on Wednesday against the New York Daily News, after the tabloid published a photo of Trump edited to make him appear similar to The Joker, a clown-like villain from the Batman comic series. Dopey Mort Zuckerman, owner of the worthless @NYDailyNews, has a major inferiority complex. Paper will close soon! Trump (@realDonaldTrump) tweeted Wednesday. The front page headline jeered at New Hampshire voters for handing the Republican presidential candidate a win in the states primary election, calling the vote dawn of the brain dead, an apparent reference to the zombie horror movie Dawn of the Dead. Trump won the New Hampshire primary by almost 20 points Tuesday night, after finishing second in last weeks Iowa caucus. He has been the most popular candidate on social media throughout the campaign, regularly outpacing his competitors in social media buzz during debates. Wednesdays online quarrel is hardly the first time that the tabloid paper and the tenacious tycoon have clashed. From his politics to his questionable coif, Trump has long been a target of the Daily News. On June 17, the paper reported that Trump was running for president with the front-page headline Clown Runs for Prez. The headline was accompanied by a photo of Trump that had been edited to depict him as a clown, complete with a red nose. That same day, Trump tweeted a retort. Only a fool would buy the @NYDailyNews. Loses fortune & has zero gravitas, Trump wrote. Let it die! Trump also came under fire from some Twitter users Tuesday night, as the former reality TV star gained momentum in the Granite State. The hashtag #TrumpRunningMate emerged on the social media site, and Twitter users cracked wise about who - or what - would join Trumps ticket, if he were to win the Republican presidential nomination. Heavily over-salted takeout that gives you two day bloat. #TrumpRunningMate, tweeted Fledgeling Feminist (@fledgelingfem). #TrumpRunningMate Kanye, and then Kim for State, tweeted Ross Burnett (@rossburnett) on Tuesday evening.

"In crucial vote, Hillary Clinton fails to rally women to her history-making bid","MANCHESTER, N.H./COLUMBIA, S.C. (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton made the prospect of her being elected the first woman U.S. president a centerpiece of her campaign, then lost a critical nominating contest to a 74-year-old man in part because women preferred him. NBC News exit polls showed Clinton, a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady, won 44 percent of the womens vote in Tuesdays New Hampshire primary to 55 percent for her Democratic Party rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. Young women contributed significantly to Clintons loss, and the candidate acknowledged that she struggled with young voters. I know I have some work to do, particularly with young people, Clinton said during a concession speech. Even if they are not supporting me now, I support them. With women over 45, Clinton prevailed with 56 percent of the vote, ABC News exit polls found, but Sanders won 69 percent among women under 45. Among women under 30, Sanders won a staggering 82 percent. Unlike Barack Obama, who played down his African-American roots when elected the first black president eight years ago, in this election cycle Clinton, 68, has emphasized the breakthrough a Nov. 8 victory would represent for women. At nearly every campaign stop in New Hampshire, Clinton or a supporter emphasized the role she could play as the first woman in the White House while Sanders galvanized young people with his promise to fix an economy he said was rigged in favor of the wealthy. Clinton said she was trying to break the hardest, highest glass ceiling. She campaigned alongside four women U.S. senators, New Hampshire Governor Maggie Hassan and Lilly Ledbetter, the woman for whom an equal-pay law is named.  Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright reprised her line that there is a special place in hell for women who dont help each other while introducing Clinton at a rally on Saturday.  Clinton told a young woman the same day that she has to walk a narrower path because she has got to be aware of the fact that Im trying to be the first woman president of the United States of America, and there has never been one before, and so people dont have, you know, an image.  The remarks by Albright, the first woman to serve as secretary of state, and others by feminist icon Gloria Steinem were assailed as disparaging by young women supporters of Sanders. Steinem had said young women were drawn to Sanders because that was where the boys were. With the next nominating contests in Nevada and South Carolina, Clinton will seek to lift her standing among women. Katherine Wilbur, 20, a geography major at the University of South Carolina from Hopkins, South Carolina, said she had yet to decide on a candidate or party. I think thats ridiculous. Its 2016, Wilbur said of the suggestion that women should vote for other women. Its not important to me. Paige Lambert, 23, who volunteered for the Sanders campaign in New Hampshire, said she thought the remarks by Steinem and Albright were sexist. I dont think I should have to vote for a woman because I am a woman, Lambert said. If I would have thought shed do better, I would have voted for her. Im not just going to vote for her because shes a woman.  Amanda Coleman, 26, of Manchester, New Hampshire, said she did not think candidates should be elected based on gender, but on their stances on the issues.

Republican N.J. Governor Christie to end White House bid: media,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is expected to end his bid for the Republican presidential nomination on Wednesday, U.S. media reported, but a Christie spokesman said the candidate had not made up his mind. No decision has been made, spokeswoman Sam Smith said in an email to Reuters. Politico, citing an unidentified source, said Christie, who placed a disappointing sixth in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, would suspend his campaign on Wednesday. Fox Business Network, in a post on Twitter, earlier reported that Christie was dropping out but did not cite any sources. Separately, CBS reported the governor could take as long as 24 hours before deciding, citing sources.  After election results came in on Tuesday evening, the two-term governor said he was returning to New Jersey rather than moving on to South Carolina, the next primary contest, and would reassess his campaign.  His departure would leave eight Republicans vying to represent the party in the November presidential election.  Christie had poured much of his campaigns resources into New Hampshire and had considered a good showing there critical. Known for his brash talk, Christie had been overshadowed by New Hampshires Republican winner, businessman and television personality Donald Trump, and failed to gain traction with voters.

Trump for president? Ladbrokes odds improve after New Hampshire,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps odds at winning the White House improved significantly after his decisive victory in Tuesdays primary in New Hampshire, online betting site Ladbrokes PLC said on Wednesday. Trumps odds for winning the presidency in the November election are now 9/2, compared to 7/1 following the Iowa caucuses last week. Iowa kicked off the parties process of nominating their presidential candidates and in the Republican race, the real estate tycoon placed second. His chances of victory in November are now 18 percent, up from 13 percent, putting him second to Democrat Hillary Clinton, whose odds of winning the presidency were even, or 50/50, on Wednesday. Clinton was roundly beaten by Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, in New Hampshire. Her odds of winning the presidency slipped from 4/5, or a 56 percent chance at the White House, seen immediately after the Iowa caucuses. Clinton, a former secretary of state, has for long been the front-runner to win the Democratic nomination but has been challenged by a surge of support for Sanders. New Hampshire couldnt have worked out much better for Trump, said Matthew Shaddick, head of political odds at Ladbrokes. This might be bad news for the Republican Party, but its not much better for us bookmakers, who are facing some huge payouts on the one-time 100/1 no-hoper. He was referring to Trumps 100/1 odds, giving him a 1 percent chance, when he declared his candidacy last June.  Marco Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida whose chances for the Republican nomination improved after he did well in the Iowa caucuses, faces longer odds after his middle of the pack finish in New Hampshire. According to Ladbrokes, Rubios odds are now 8/1, giving him an 11 percent chance at becoming president. After Iowa, Rubios odds at becoming president had been  11/4, giving him a 26 percent chance.  Ohio Governor John Kasich, who surged to a surprising second place finish in the New Hampshires Republican primary, still faces relatively long odds of 33/1, giving him a 3 percent chance at winning the presidency. The candidates have embarked on what can be a months-long state-by-state battle to win party support. The parties formally announce their presidential nominees at summer conventions. Interest in Kasich on social media surged - he received 30,500 mentions on Twitter on Tuesday, more than four times what he got during the Iowa caucuses, according to Brandwatch.

"Concerned by cyber threat, Obama seeks big increase in funding","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Tuesday sought a surge in funding to counter cyber security threats, as his top intelligence official warned Congress that computer attacks were among the most imminent security challenges facing the United States. In his fiscal 2017 budget proposal, Obama asked for $19 billion for cyber security across the U.S. government, an increase of $5 billion over this year  While the White Houses overall fiscal plan faces tough going in the Republican-controlled Congress, increased cyber security funding has won bipartisan support of lawmakers in the past. The request comes as the Obama administration has struggled to address the growing risk posed by criminals and nation states in the digital world. In Congress, Obamas director of national intelligence, James Clapper, warned that cyber threats could lead to widespread vulnerabilities in civilian infrastructures and U.S. government systems. The Obama initiative calls for a more than one-third increase from the $14 billion appropriated this year and would include $3.1 billion for technology modernization at various federal agencies. Cyber threats are among the most urgent dangers to Americas economic and national security, Obama said in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published on Tuesday.  The request for a cash infusion is the latest signal that the White House intends to make cyber security a priority in the last year of Obamas presidency.  It follows a series of high-profile hacks against the government and companies like Sony Pictures (6758.T) and Target (TGT.N) that were largely met with legislative inaction and administrative uncertainty on how best to address evolving cyber threats. Those difficulties played out publicly last year when the Office of Personnel Management announced it had fallen victim to a hack that lifted sensitive information on roughly 22 million individuals from its databases.  The White House issued an executive order setting up a presidential commission on cyber security, which would make recommendations for strengthening defenses over the next decade. A new position of federal chief information security officer also would be established.  A government watchdog report last month concluded the governments cyber defense system, known as Einstein, is ineffective at combating hackers. Obama also signed another executive order creating a permanent Federal Privacy Council, which aims to connect privacy officials across the government to develop comprehensive guidelines for how personal data is collected and stored. The presidents budget proposal also called for $62 million to expand efforts to attract and retain qualified cyber professionals working for the government. ",politicsNews,"February 9, 2016 ",1
U.S. lawmakers seek to bar states from mandating encryption weaknesses,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives lawmakers will introduce bipartisan legislation on Wednesday that would prohibit states from requiring tech companies to build encryption weaknesses into their products. The move marks the latest foray into an ongoing debate over encryption between Silicon Valley and Washington. While tech companies generally oppose weakened security standards, federal authorities have warned about a going dark phenomenon in which criminal suspects use powerful encryption in their communications so that investigators cannot access a phones content, even with a warrant. The ENCRYPT Act, sponsored by Democratic Representative Ted Lieu and Republican Blake Farenthold, would prevent any state or locality from mandating that a manufacturer, developer, seller, or provider design or alter the security of a product so it can be decrypted or surveilled by authorities, according to bill text viewed by Reuters. The legislation is in response to proposals in recent months in New York and California that would require companies to be able to decrypt their smartphones manufactured after 2017, Lieu said.  It is completely technologically unworkable for individual states to mandate different encryption standards in consumer products, Lieu told Reuters in an interview. Apple (AAPL.O) cant make a different smartphone for California and New York and the rest of the country. It is unclear how much momentum the bill will have in the House, though the chamber has staked out positions sympathetic to digital privacy in recent years. Encryption has been an area of disagreement between tech companies and law enforcement authorities for decades, but it gained renewed scrutiny after Apple and Google (GOOGL.O) began offering strong encryption by default on their products in 2014.  FBI Director James Comey told a Senate panel on Tuesday that federal investigators have still been unable to access the contents of a cellphone belonging to one of the killers in the Dec. 2 shootings in San Bernardino, California, because of encryption. But technology companies, privacy advocates and cryptographers say any mandated vulnerability would expose data to hackers and jeopardize the overall integrity of the Internet. A study from the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University released last month, citing some current and former intelligence officials, concluded that fears about encryption are overstated in part because new technologies have given investigators unprecedented means to track suspects.

"Trump raps Merkel over migrants, says U.S. could have good relations with Putin","PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential contender Donald Trump said German Chancellor Angela Merkel was wrong to let in thousands of migrants into Germany and that the refugee crisis could trigger revolutions and even the end of Europe. I think Angela Merkel made a tragic mistake with the migrants, Trump told French conservative weekly Valeurs Actuelles, which said it was the billionaires first in-depth campaign interview with European media. If you dont treat the situation competently and firmly, yes, its the end of Europe. You could face real revolutions, Trump was quoted as saying, according to the French translation. The 69-year-old property magnate also said Brussels had become a breeding ground for terrorists and some neighborhoods in Paris and elsewhere in France had become no-go zones. Unfortunately, France is not what it used to be, and neither is Paris, he said. He also said tight French gun laws were partly responsible for the killing of dozens of people at the Bataclan concert hall last November by Islamist militants. I always have a gun with me. Had I been at the Bataclan, I can tell you I would have opened fire, he said. Trump further said he thought the United States could have very good relations with Russias Vladimir Putin and that nothing could be worse than the current situation where President Barack Obama and Putin scarcely spoke with each other. He (Putin) said I was brilliant. That proves a certain smartness, said Trump. The French magazine said the interview was conducted at Trumps office in New Yorks Trump Tower a week before the Iowa caucuses, in which he finished second among candidates seeking the Republican nomination for Novembers presidential election.   Trump was widely expected to win Tuesdays primary in New Hampshire, which is part of the state-by-state process of picking party nominees for the Nov. 8 election to replace Democratic President Barack Obama.

Pentagon budget requests $146 million in support for Israel defense,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Departments fiscal year 2017 budget requests $145.8 million in support for Israel, including Iron Dome and other cooperative defense programs, according to Pentagon documents released Tuesday. The Iron Dome system is designed to defeat short-range missiles and rockets. The United States will also continue to help fund Davids Sling, a medium-range missile interceptor, set to be deployed this year, as well as the Arrow ballistic missile interceptor. The systems are meant to form a multi-level shield that the Israelis are developing with Washingtons help as a bulwark against Iran and its allies on the Israeli border. The U.S. Missile Defense Agencys fiscal 2017 budget request  included $103.8 million for Israeli cooperative programs, down from $267.6 million in fiscal 2016, plus $42 million for Iron Dome, down from $55 million in fiscal 2016. The budget forecast total spending on Israeli cooperative programs of $540 million over the next five years, with no additional funding for Iron Dome envisioned after $42 million in fiscal 2017. Vice Admiral James Syring, director of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, told reporters the agency was working with Israel under a co-production agreement signed for the Iron Dome system, with a not insignificant workshare going to U.S. firms. He declined to give the specific percentage share. Syring said the United States and Israel were working on a second co-production agreement for the Davids Sling program,  although he declined to give a timeframe for reaching a deal.  He said a test of the Davids Sling system late last year exceeded expectations. Raytheon Co is working with Israels state-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd on the Iron Dome and Davids Sling programs.  Syring said Israel had not signaled any plans to request additional funds for missile defense programs, as it did last year, after the agency sent its budget request to Congress. He said any decision on funding would be up to Congress, which must approve the budget. Robert Scher, assistant defense secretary for strategy, plans and capabilities, told Congress last year that the U.S. government had provided more than $3 billion to Israel for work on Davids Sling and other missile defense programs since 2001.

Supreme Court blocks Obama carbon emissions plan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday delivered a major blow to President Barack Obama by putting on hold federal regulations to curb carbon dioxide emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants, the centerpiece of his administrations strategy to combat climate change. The court voted 5-4 along ideological lines to grant a request by 27 states and various companies and business groups to block the administrations Clean Power Plan, which also mandates a shift to renewable energy away from fossil fuels. The highly unusual move by the justices means the regulations will not be in effect while a court battle continues over their legality. The White House on Tuesday night said it disagrees with the court decision but said it expects the rule will survive the legal challenge. We remain confident that we will prevail on the merits, the White House said, adding that the Environmental Protection Agency will continue to work with states that want to cooperate and that it will continue to take aggressive steps to reduce carbon emissions.     The plan was designed to lower carbon emissions from U.S. power plants by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels. It is the main tool for the United States to meet the emissions reduction target it pledged at U.N. climate talks in Paris in December. A senior administration official told reporters on Tuesday night that despite the courts procedural decision, the United States can deliver those commitments and take new and additional steps to lead internationally on climate change. The Supreme Courts action casts doubt on the long-term future of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys rule because it increases the chances that the conservative-leaning Supreme Court would take the case after a lower court issues a decision on the legality of the regulations and ultimately would strike it down. As recently as June, the high court ruled 5-4 against the Obama administration over its efforts to regulate mercury and other toxic air pollutants. The states, led by coal producer West Virginia and oil producer Texas, and several major business groups in October launched the legal effort seeking to block the Obama administrations plan. The states said the emissions curbs would have a devastating impact on their economies. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey described the Supreme Court action on Tuesday as a historic and unprecedented victory over the EPA. Tom Donahue, chief executive officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the high court stay will ensure that America will not be forced to make costly and irreversible implementation decisions based upon an unprecedented regulation until judicial review is complete.      For Obama, executing his domestic and international climate change strategy would be a key legacy accomplishment as he nears the end of his time in office in January 2017. House of Representatives Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said, The Supreme Courts deeply misguided decision to stay the implementation of the Clean Power Plan will enable those states that deny climate science to slow progress in reducing the carbon pollution that threatens the health of all Americans. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy welcomed the Supreme Courts move, saying it has now stopped this illegitimate abuse of power after 27 states revolted against the presidents anti-energy agenda.  The court action also means that, with Obama leaving office in January 2017, the next president will have a say on whether to continue defending the regulation. Before that, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which denied a similar stay request last month, will hear oral arguments in the case on June 2 and decide whether the regulations are lawful. This is certainly a surprise and it suggests the court has serious concerns about the regulation, said Jonathan Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve School of Law. The brief order from the justices said that the regulations would be on hold until the legal challenge is completed. The courts five conservatives all voted to block the rule. The order noted that the four liberals would have denied the application. Under the EPA rule, each state must submit a plan to comply with its emission-reduction target by September 2016 but can also request a two-year extension. The challengers contended that the Obama administration exceeded its authority under the Clean Air Act, the key law that addresses air pollution. More than a dozen other states and the National League of Cities, which represents more than 19,000 U.S. cities, filed court papers backing the rule. Jeff Holmstead, a lawyer for coal-powered utilities that challenged the rule, said the court has never before blocked an EPA rule. To say its unusual is a bit of an understatement, Holmstead added. Sean Donahue, a lawyer for environmental groups that support the law, said the court action was surprising and disappointing. He added that we remain very confident in the legal and factual foundations for EPAs rule. Sam Adams, U.S. climate director for the World Resources Institute, said fighting to uphold the rule is important to ensure the Paris agreement stays intact. The benefits of the Clean Power Plan are definitely worth fighting for, not only for the United States but the high expectations it hopes to set internationally, he said.

Democratic nomination will likely be won in March: Clinton campaign manager,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hillary Clintons campaign manager said on Tuesday the Democratic nomination for the 2016 presidential election would very likely be decided in March, and that the support of black and Hispanic voters would be key to victory. It will be very difficult, if not impossible, for a Democrat to win the nomination without strong levels of support among African American and Hispanic voters, campaign manager Robby Mook wrote in a memo titled March Matters. The nomination will very likely be won in March, not February, and we believe that Hillary Clinton is well positioned to build a strong  potentially insurmountable  delegate lead next month, he said.  CNN projected on Tuesday that Clinton lost to U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in the New Hampshire primary.

Obama proposes $4.1 trillion spending plan in final White House budget,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama proposed a $4.1 trillion spending plan for fiscal year 2017 on Tuesday in a final White House budget that met immediate Republican resistance for its cost and reliance on tax hikes to fund domestic priorities. Obama, a Democrat who leaves office next January, sought to outline his fiscal and political vision for the country with proposed investments in infrastructure, cyber security, education, and job growth. It also includes more than $11 billion for the Departments of Defense and State to fight Islamic State militants and stabilize Syria - one measure that could draw bipartisan support. But the plan is primarily a political document and is  unlikely to be embraced by the Republican-controlled Congress. Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, called it a manual for growing the federal government at the expense of hardworking Americans. The budget envisions a deficit of $503 billion in fiscal 2017 after a $616 billion budget gap in the current fiscal year ending on Sept. 30. It seeks to cut deficits by $2.9 trillion over 10 years  largely through smaller tax breaks for wealthy earners, new savings in Medicare healthcare, and assumptions that adoption of its policies on immigration reform and other areas would boost economic growth. The budget that were releasing today reflects my priorities and the priorities that I believe will help advance security and prosperity in America for many years to come, Obama told reporters at the White House after a meeting with national security advisers on cyber security. It drives down the deficit. It includes smart savings on healthcare, immigration, tax reform, he said. The budget seeks $19 billion for cyber security investments across the U.S. government. White House officials sought to play down the portrayal of the budget as dead on arrival in Congress. They noted bipartisan support for increases in funds for cancer research, opioid addiction programs and anti-poverty measures such as an expansion of the earned income tax credit (EITC), which helps low-income taxpayers. Other proposals were clear non-starters, though, including one to levy a $10.25 per barrel tax on imported and domestically produced oil to fund transportation infrastructure such as mass transit and high speed rail. The presidents final budget continues his focus on new spending proposals instead of confronting our countrys massive overspending and skyrocketing $19 trillion in debt, said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi. The budget forecasts that deficits would average 2.5 percent of U.S. economic output over 10 years compared to about 4.0 percent in the Congressional Budget Offices estimate, which is based on existing tax and spending laws.  It stayed within the bounds of an agreement reached between the White House and Congress last year that lifted mandatory sequestration cuts on both defense and domestic spending. The budget proposes lifting the limits entirely from 2018. Obama and Ryan agree on some anti-poverty policies, but the general differences between the two men and their parties are vast, particularly in a presidential election year. Underscoring that divide and the fact that the budget is Obamas last, Republican lawmakers took the unusual step of not inviting Obamas budget director Shaun Donovan to brief about the proposal. White House spokesman Josh Earnest, who has likened the snub to Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trumps decision to skip a debate with fellow candidates before the Iowa nominating contest, challenged Republicans to move on areas of compromise. The question really for Republicans at this point is, are they going to do anything? Are they going to use their majority in Congress to strengthen our cyber security, to fight opioid addiction, to cure cancer, or are they not? he said. Congress can advance elements of the budget without endorsing the entire proposal. Republicans are especially resistant to the White Houses tax proposals. The budget takes aim at tax breaks for the wealthy that have been perennial targets, including the carried interest loophole allowing investment fund managers to treat income as capital gains. It would also increase the top tax rate on capital gains and impose the Buffett Rule to ensure that millionaires pay a tax rate of no less than 30 percent of their income after charitable contributions.  In addition, it proposes a new fee on the liabilities of the largest banks that would raise $111 billion over 10 years and discourage excessive leverage in the financial system. The budget foresees $375 billion in new 10-year savings to federal healthcare programs, including several changes to the Medicare program for seniors. The budget calls for $152 billion in research and development, an increase of 4 percent over fiscal year 2016. ",politicsNews,"February 9, 2016 ",1
Pentagon seeks $583 billion budget for 2017; Republicans say not enough,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon on Tuesday proposed a $582.7 billion defense budget that emphasizes emerging threats from Russia, China and Islamic State rebels, but the plan is already under fire from Republican lawmakers who charge it short-changes the U.S. military. President Barack Obamas last budget would boost spending on the war against Islamic State militants to $7.5 billion during the 2017 fiscal year, a 50 percent jump over the $5 billion approved this year. Some $200 million of that would go to fight militants in north and west Africa. The proposal also would quadruple funds to counter Russian pressure in Europe, including its seizure of Ukraines Crimean peninsula and repeated strategic bomber flights near NATO air space. Spending to boost U.S. military presence and training in Europe would rise to $3.4 billion from $800 million this year. The budget heralds a strategic shift as Washington looks beyond the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and enters a new period of great power competition from Russia and China as well as threats from smaller rivals like Iran and North Korea, officials said. This budget marks a major inflection point for the Department of Defense, Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in a statement. Even as we fight todays fights, we must also be prepared for the fights that might come in 10, 20 or 30 years. Overall, the administration is seeking a Pentagon base budget of $523.9 billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, plus $58.8 billion for war funding and overseas operations. The base budget is about $2.5 billion more than this years while war spending remains relatively flat, officials said. The spending proposal is in line with a congressional budget deal last year that set Pentagon funding guidelines for 2016 and 2017. But Republican lawmakers have criticized the war funding plan, saying the $59 billion figure in the budget deal was a floor, not a ceiling, and the president should have sought more. This request is inadequate to address the national security threats we face, Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. Congressman Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, accused the administration of playing budgetary games. McCain said by seeking the minimum level of war funding in the budget deal, the president had left the Pentagon with $17 billion less than it estimated it would need for 2017 in last years budget. To make up the shortfall in planned spending, the Pentagon cut more than $5 billion by adjusting its assumptions about expected fuel costs and inflation levels, Pentagon Comptroller Mike McCord said. It also cut procurement to $112.1 billion, down 6 percent, from this year. The reductions would come mainly from planned aircraft purchases, including five fewer F-35 Joint Strike Fighters (LMT.N) and a reduction in several types of Army helicopters(BA.N), budget documents show.  While cutting procurement, the Pentagon proposed increasing spending on research and development by 4 percent, to $71.8 billion, as it looks to develop new technologies to give it a military edge. The department said it would spend $16.8 billion in its classified military intelligence accounts.  It also agreed to delay until 2022 its controversial plan to retire the A-10 close air support aircraft, which is being used in the fight against Islamic State. Retaining the aircraft will cost $3.4 billion over the five-year period. The budget would continue to shrink the size of the U.S. Army, which will drop to 460,000 soldiers in 2017 from the current 475,000. Separately, the presidents budget would fund a new $150 million polar icebreaker vessel to ensure year-round accessibility to the Arctic for Coast Guard missions.

Michigan treasurer calls for quick action on Detroit school bills,"(Reuters) - Michigan Treasurer Nick Khouri urged state lawmakers on Tuesday to move quickly on legislation to restructure the financially ailing Detroit Public Schools (DPS) before the district runs out of money. Sometime this spring or early summer, unless legislation passes in some form, the district will not be able to make payroll, will not be able to pay vendors. Essentially they will be out of cash, Khouri told the Michigan Senates Government Operations Committee. The committee has been holding hearings this month on bills supported by Republican Governor Rick Snyder to create two entities - the Detroit Community District to run the schools, and the current Detroit Public Schools to retire debt. Khouri said the legislation presents a better option for DPS and Michigan than a bankruptcy which would not make sense given much of the districts debt is owed to the state. He added that bankruptcy could also take a year at a cost of as much as $100 million. Unlike the city of Detroits bankruptcy, a DPS filing would put the state on the hook for $1.45 billion over 11 years to pay off bonds issued for DPS through Michigans school bond loan fund, according to written testimony Khouri submitted to the committee.  Under the governors plan, the new community school district would be provided with $715 million in additional state funding over 10 years to offset local property taxes, which would be tapped by the old district to pay off debt. Another $240 million in DPS pension debt could be shifted onto other school districts in the state-wide teachers retirement system. Detroit exited the biggest-ever municipal bankruptcy in December 2014, shedding about $7 billion of its $18 billion of debt. The Senate committee, which will continue its hearing on the legislation next week, also heard from teachers union officials and parents who contended Michigan should be responsible for paying off debt accumulated by DPS since it was placed under state oversight in 2009. They also called for an elected board to be in control of the schools. The legislation would create a financial oversight commission for the district. ",politicsNews,"February 9, 2016 ",1
Republican senator: Obama administration already has funds for Zika,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration has no immediate need for funding to combat the Zika virus because money remains unspent from fighting the two-year-long Ebola outbreak, a member of the Republican Senate leadership said on Tuesday. Lawmakers are debating what resources are needed as Zika spreads in South and Central America and the Caribbean and raises fears of the possibility of birth defects.  But while Democrats joined with the administration to call for more than $1.8 billion in emergency funding, Republicans say there is no need for immediate action and intend to have hearings on Capitol Hill, including a meeting with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell on Tuesday.   We all believe this needs to be dealt with, said Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, who will chair a hearing about Zika on Thursday.   Theres still money left that was appropriated for Ebola, Blunt told reporters. So theres no immediate shortage of money for the administration to do what they think needs to be done. He said that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the National Institutes of Health have received additional funding. Most of the money sought by Obama would be spent in the United States on testing, surveillance and response. A Republican aide said the government had $1.49 billion left in Ebola funding as of Dec. 31, 2015. The Ebola outbreak began  in West Africa in December 2013. The CDC received a $272 million increase for 2016, the aide said. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services were not immediately available to comment.  Democrats rejected the Republican agenda of hearings and called for action on Obamas plan. All the lip service in the world isnt going to protect America from the Zika virus, said Senator Charles Schumer of New York, the Senates No. 3 Democrat. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak an international health emergency on Feb. 1, citing a strongly suspected relationship between Zika infection in pregnancy and microcephaly, a condition marked by abnormally small head size that can result in developmental problems. Brazil is investigating more than 4,000 suspected cases of microcephaly and has identified evidence of Zika infection in 17 of these cases. But much remains unknown about Zika.

Factbox: What is in Obama's final budget proposal?,"(Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Tuesday unveiled his budget proposal for fiscal year 2017, his final year in office.  But since the Republican-controlled Congress controls the purse strings, much of Obamas plan likely will be shelved and so it is primarily a political document. The following are some of Obamas proposals: The Pentagon asked for $7.5 billion to fight Islamic State, up 50 percent from the amount received in the previous years budget, and wants a fourfold increase for military training and exercises in Europe to support NATO allies.  Citing online threats as a top concern, Obama sought $19 billion to boost cyber security across the U.S. government, a $5 billion increase over the current fiscal year. In a long-shot bid to raise $20 billion to expand transit systems and research self-driving cars, Obama proposed a $10.25-a-barrel tax on crude oil.   Obama sought a 20 percent boost for renewable energy research funding to a total of $7.7 billion. Obama proposed a tax credit for businesses that invest in community college programs and then hire their graduates. The White House asked for $1.8 billion in emergency funding. Some Republicans argue Obama might have enough in existing funds for now.  Obama sought an 11 percent hike in funding for the Securities and Exchange Commission to $1.8 billion, and 32 percent increase for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to $330 million. Obama asked for $1 billion to fund a two-year effort to expand treatment for people addicted to heroin and prescription painkillers.  Obama proposed $12.2 billion over 10 years to supplement food stamps for poor families when school meal programs are closed in the summer and a $15 million pilot program to help poor families move to better neighborhoods, among other aid. The earned income tax credit for low-income taxpayers would be doubled to a maximum of about $1,022 a year. It would be expanded to cover workers with earnings up to 150 percent of the poverty line and to cover single workers ages 21-24. The budget includes three years of federal funding to states that passed up an earlier offer to expand Medicaid healthcare coverage for low-income people. Obama proposed changes to certain high-cost health insurance plans. The White House asked for $5.5 billion in incentives for businesses that hire young people and setting aside $200 million for youth from a $2 billion apprenticeship fund. Obama proposed $4 billion for states and $100 million for school districts to expand computer science in schools. The White House sought $755 million for Vice President Joe Bidens moonshot effort to find new cancer treatments. Obama proposed $500 million for a two-year initiative to boost access to mental healthcare as part of his push to address gun violence. As part of criminal justice system reforms, Obama asked for $24 million to review the use of restrictive housing, or solitary confinement, and expand mental health programs. Obama proposed tax credits for small businesses offering 401(k) plans or expanding access to retirement savings programs, while setting aside $6.5 million for some states to explore state-based programs.  Military and civilian federal personnel would see a 1.6 percent pay increase. Obama asked for funding to hire 200 new ATF staff to enforce gun laws. ",politicsNews,"February 9, 2016 ",1
Senate unanimously approves Myanmar ambassador nominee,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed President Barack Obamas nominee to be ambassador to Myanmar on Tuesday, after the administration assured lawmakers it would not rush to ease  sanctions as the country moves from decades of military rule. The Senate voted 90-0 to confirm career diplomat Scot Marciel to the post in Myanmar, also known as Burma. Currently the principal deputy assistant secretary in the State Departments Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Marciel has also been ambassador to Indonesia and served in Vietnam, the Philippines, Brazil and Turkey. Obama nominated Marciel to be his next envoy to Myanmar in October. His confirmation vote had been briefly delayed by concerns that the administration might ease sanctions before the countrys human rights situation improved.  ",politicsNews,"February 9, 2016 ",1
Yellen faces tough sell on Fed rate hikes in Congress,"WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will defend the U.S. central banks first rate hike in a decade and likely insist that further rises this year remain on track, albeit at a slower pace, when she addresses Congress on Wednesday. Yellen, who is certain to be grilled by lawmakers on whether the economy really is ready for higher rates, will point to continued strong jobs growth even as financial markets have all but priced out any rate hikes this year and as signs of stress in the global financial system have re-emerged amid volatile markets. The Fed Chair also is likely to find herself in heated exchanges with lawmakers over the banks perceived secrecy, with presidential candidates from both sides of the aisle now taking regular shots at the Fed on the campaign trail. I think that markets probably have over-reacted to the sense that the Fed wont raise rates any time soon, said Vincent Reinhart, visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and former head of the Feds monetary affairs division.  The House Financial Services Committee hearing is set for 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT) on Wednesday, followed on Thursday at 10 a.m. EST by a Senate Banking Committee hearing. U.S. growth slowed to 0.7 percent rate in the fourth quarter as weak global demand weighed on the economy. But the housing sector strengthened, unemployment fell to 4.9 percent last month and, in a relief for the Fed, wages jumped in January by the most in a year. Vice Chair Stanley Fischer and other Fed officials have recently backed off predictions of about four rate hikes this year, noting that plunging oil prices mean U.S. inflation could take longer to rise to a 2 percent goal. But policymakers have stressed that it is too soon to scrap forecasts for continued U.S. strength in 2016. Some have noted that a similarly severe market selloff in August and September did not derail the economy as much as initially feared. September is ... a case where there were tighter financial conditions, and they didnt last that long and then we moved off (zero rates), Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, a voter on Fed policy this year, said last week. The Fed overcame deep market skepticism that it would initiate a hiking cycle when it pulled off its first rate rise in almost a decade in December last year. At a twice-yearly appearances before Congress, the Fed chair is often peppered with barbed questions about the central banks effectiveness, regulatory chops and commitment to congressionally set goals, both from Republicans like House Financial Services Chair Jeb Hensarling as well as Democrats like Elizabeth Warren, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee. Some of the top presidential candidates, including Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders, are calling for major reforms to the Fed.  All of that could complicate things for Yellen as she tries to keep alive the prospect of further rate rises even as she acknowledges the threat posed by a slowing global economy. We must not forget, after all, that despite the financial market rout and the pain in the mining and manufacturing sector, the Fed has gotten closer to meeting both of its mandates, said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at Unicredit, after data on Tuesday showed job openings surged in December.

McCain: Obama budget request 'inadequate' to face security threats,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, took immediate issue on Tuesday with President Barack Obamas budget request, saying it would leave the Defense Department with at least $17 billion less than it said it needed and planned for this year.

U.S. has room to fight any future downturn with spending: Furman,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White Houses top economic adviser, Jason Furman, said on Tuesday that the United States has ample capacity to boost spending to cushion any future economic downturn. Furman, at a news conference on President Barack Obamas final budget proposal, said that gross domestic product growth may be slowing somewhat, but that is being offset in a fiscal context by lower unemployment and lower-than-expected interest rates, and a continued decline in healthcare costs. Our country has the fiscal room, if and when it is ever needed at some hypothetical future date, to use fiscal policy as one of the tools that we would deploy in those circumstances, Furman said.

Obama to propose $200 million to battle Islamist militants in Africa,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama is proposing about $200 million in new military spending to confront Islamist militants in north and west Africa, U.S. defense officials said ahead of Tuesdays budget rollouts for the next fiscal year. U.S. officials declined to specify to which nations the funding would be directed. The disclosure comes as the United States and its allies discuss ways to halt the spread of Islamic State in Libya and elsewhere in Africa from its self-declared caliphate in Syria and Iraq. The proposed increase in U.S. defense spending for north and west Africa is a component of a larger $7.5 billion Pentagon request for fiscal year 2017 to counter Islamic State. The marginal increase is on the order of about $200 million associated with north Africa, one U.S. defense official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to a small group of reporters. Another U.S. defense official told Reuters the funds would also be directed to west Africa. Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Air Force General Paul Selva said the new funding was aimed at addressing threats from militant groups across Africa, including al Shabaab in the east, Boko Haram in the west, and Islamic State in Libya. The monies that weve put into the budget to address those threats in Africa are to be able to work with indigenous forces as well as partner forces to get at those three particular threats and others that might emerge, Selva said. U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter last week announced his intention to ramp up spending to counter Islamic State as he unveiled the broad details of Obamas proposed $582.7 billion defense budget. A key part of the $7.5 billion would go to munitions. Carter said the United States has used so many smart bombs and laser-guided rockets in Iraq and Syria that it is running low and needs to invest $1.8 billion for 45,000 more. The Air Force budget includes about 4,500 small diameter bombs, doubling the previous years purchase. It also calls for  more than 30,000 Boeing Co (BA.N) Joint Direct Attack Munition tail kits, which turn unguided bombs into all-weather smart munitions using GPS guidance systems, compared to about 22,000 the previous year. The Navy is slated to buy 100 Hellfire missiles built by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), with the Air Force planning to buy around 280. The U.S. officials also said some of the $7.5 billion would go toward training and equipping Iraqi forces and fighters in Syria to counter Islamic State. Lieutenant General Vincent Stewart, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, warned on Monday of the groups expansion to Libya, Egypts Sinai Peninsula, Nigeria, Algeria and elsewhere. The United States has a limited permanent military presence in Africa, largely centered on a U.S. base in Djibouti.  Islamic State forces have attacked Libyas oil infrastructure and taken control of the city of Sirte, exploiting a power vacuum in which two rival governments have been battling for supremacy. The Pentagon has said planning is underway to confront the group in Libya, although significant political hurdles could slow any new campaign by the U.S. and its allies there. Carter will meet with allies in Brussels this week to discuss ways to accelerate the campaign against Islamic State.  ",politicsNews,"February 9, 2016 ",1
Pentagon's No. 2 says cut in LCS ship program 'not an indictment',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work said the Pentagons plan to truncate the Littoral Combat Ship program at 40 ships instead of 52 reflected budget pressures and was not an indictment of the program. Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Australias Austal (ASB.AX) each build different models of the smaller, fast coastal warships. Carter said he wants the Navy to have a competition and pick just one supplier for future ships. Work said the Pentagon decided to buy two of the ships in fiscal 2017, instead of scaling orders back to just one ship as Defense Secretary Ash Carter had ordered in a memo late last year, at the Navys request. He said the move was meant to help ensure a smooth transition to a future competition by keeping both shipbuilders working for another year. ",politicsNews,"February 9, 2016 ",1
Pennsylvania $2 bln budget gap is 'time bomb': governor,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pennsylvanias $2 billion budget deficit is a time bomb that could cause fiscal catastrophe the likes of which we have never seen if it is not resolved, Governor Tom Wolf said in his budget address on Tuesday. Wolf proposed a $32.7 billion fiscal 2017 budget that would add $200 million of funding for K-12 public schools and another $110 million to early and special education programs. Including pension contributions, the budget would be nearly $33.3 billion. To pay for the increases, Wolf would increase personal income taxes by nearly 11 percent to 3.4 percent, expand sales taxes, raise taxes on tobacco products and implement a 6.5 percent severance tax on natural gas producers, according to documents released during his speech. But dominating Wolfs message was the budgetary crisis escalated by political gridlock. Wolf, a Democrat, and the Republican-led legislature have disagreed since this time last year, when Wolf proposed his first budget. Now seven months after the start of fiscal 2016 on July 1, the state still has only a partial $23.4 billion emergency spending plan. Wolf had been ready to sign a negotiated $30.8 billion agreement but it was scuttled in December. Wolf reminded lawmakers of that turn of events on Tuesday. In web-streamed remarks, he urged them to send the agreement back to him. House Republican leaders just walked away, he said during his speech at the state capitol in Harrisburg. Some booed in response.  Yelling will not make it go away, Wolf said. We need to do whats right, he continued, to applause. He later told lawmakers to find another job if they could not reach a solution. His 2017 proposal is built upon the eventual approval of that compromise budget for the current fiscal year.  Senate Republicans, who had passed the budget compromise, said Wolf was doubling down on last years proposal. This retread budget proposal offers superficial changes to his sizable tax-and-spend plan that has already been soundly opposed by taxpayers, Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman said in a statement on Tuesday. Unless next years deficit is closed, property taxes for homeowners will skyrocket, Wolf said. More than 23,000 teachers and school employees would be cut, as would special education and pre-kindergarten programs.  Services for senior citizens, the mentally ill, child care and domestic violence shelters also would be slashed, he said. Wolfs address was no olive branch, said Muhlenberg College political scientist Christopher Borick.  He turned up the heat, Borick said. ",politicsNews,"February 9, 2016 ",1

Obama budget envisions $2.9 trillion in 10-year deficit reduction ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Tuesday unveiled a budget that proposed $2.9 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years, largely by curbing tax breaks for the wealthy and proposing new savings in the Medicare and Medicaid health care programs. The budget would boost spending to $4.1 trillion for 2017, up $196 billion from fiscal 2016, while raising revenues by $308 over the same period, according to documents released by the White House. Spending increases are spread across a wide range of programs, from new support for community colleges to helping NATO and other European allies resist Russian aggression. The budget also proposes $375 billion in new 10-year savings to federal healthcare programs, including several changes to the Medicare program for seniors. These include new competitive bidding requirements for the Medicare Advantage Program, certain  co-payments for home health episodes, and new mandates for  pricing rebates for name-brand drugs.

Obama urges doubling tax credit for low-income childless workers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Tuesday proposed expanding the earned income tax credit (EITC), which helps low-income taxpayers, to give a bigger boost to childless people. Some Republicans as well as Democrats in Congress back increasing the tax credit. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, favors expanding the credit as an incentive for pulling people into work. In his budget blueprint for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, Obama proposed doubling the tax credit for workers who are not raising children, bringing the credit to a maximum of about $1,022 a year for them. He said it should be expanded to cover workers with earnings up to 150 percent of the poverty line, so about $18,180 for a single person. Under current law the cutoff comes at about $15,040. Obama also favors expanding eligibility to single workers between ages 21-24 to help draw them into the workforce; currently they must be 25 to qualify. The Earned Income Tax Credit, created in 1975, is intended to promote work as well as help low-income people. Because it is a refundable credit, it produces a refund if the taxpayer does not owe any taxes. Currently it gives more generous benefits to families with children. Obama has proposed expanding it for the past two years; Ryan agrees it should be increased for childless workers. But they disagree on how it should be funded. Obama has talked about closing tax loopholes, while Ryan has talked about cutting spending. Obamas budget proposed making the credit available to workers aged 65 and 66, and to workers in the struggling territory of Puerto Rico. The White House said its proposal would help 13.2 million low-income people. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) said recently that in 2013, a total of $68.1 billion was claimed by 28.8 million tax filers under the program.  But it said the rules were too complex and up to a quarter of payments were issued improperly. Obamas budget also proposed $12 billion over 10 years to supplement food stamps for poor families when school meal programs are closed in the summer.  It asked for $2 billion in emergency aid for families in crisis, a $1.2 billion increase in rental assistance to poor families, $328 million in education and housing grants to poor neighborhoods, and a $15 million pilot program to help poor families move to better neighborhoods.

Obama calls for updates to government IT to protect Americans,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Tuesday his budget proposal aims to bolster Americans safety with a significant investment in cyber security with an eye toward overhauling how the federal government manages and responds to online threats. Obama, speaking to reporters after meeting with national security advisers, said the United States must increase its spending to upgrade outdated government technology systems that are far behind the private sector.  Obama, in his budget released earlier on Tuesday, proposed an increase in U.S. cyber security funding. ",politicsNews,"February 9, 2016 ",1
White House debt path view tied to optimistic growth forecast,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administrations plan to set federal borrowing on a sustainable path relies on stronger economic growth than what is seen by other big government agencies, which in turn have been lowering their expectations. The administrations view, laid out on Tuesday in its annual budget proposal, is that gross domestic product will grow 2.3 percent each year over the long run.  The median policymaker at the Federal Reserve, however, sees long-term growth at 2 percent, which is the same rate seen by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. The differences are modest but show White House economists are being slower to downgrade their view of Americas growth potential. While the Fed and the CBO have been cutting their views on long-term growth in recent years, the White House has held steady in each budget submitted since early 2013.  Over the same period, the CBO has cut its view from 2.2 percent and the views of core Fed policymakers have gone from a 2.3-2.5 percent range to a 1.8-2.2 percent range.      It is impossible to make a full apples-to-apples comparison between the administrations view with those of the Fed and CBO. The administrations projections are based on the assumption its budget is fully enacted, which is unlikely to happen.  Proposed immigration law changes would make the workforce younger and more productive while infrastructure investments would also boost efficiency, the administration said in the budget. Prominent academics including former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Northwestern University economist Robert Gordon have warned that U.S. growth may have shifted persistently lower in recent decades.  A stronger growth view allows the White House to project that the national debt will stay around 75 percent of GDP through 2026. The CBO by comparison sees debt on an upward path over the period, hitting 86 percent in 2026.  White House economists acknowledge slower growth would put pressure on the budget, saying in Tuesdays proposal that a 1 percentage point slowdown in GDP growth would add $3.1 trillion to the deficit in the decade through 2026. The budget also assumes a modest pace of health care inflation, easing strains on the budget created by an aging society, while arguing that proposed investments and immigration reform will help productivity growth. But the proposal notes that slower productivity growth and higher health care costs could result in a debt explosion, with debt-to-GDP reaching over 500 percent by (around 2090).

What will be in Obama's final budget proposal?,"(Reuters) - President Barack Obama is set on Tuesday to unveil his budget proposal for fiscal year 2017, his final year in office.  But since the Republican-controlled Congress controls the purse strings, much of Obamas plan likely will be shelved. The following are some of the proposals that will be included: The Pentagon will ask for more than $7 billion for the fight against Islamic State, up about 35 percent from the previous years budget request to Congress, and wants a fourfold increase for military training and exercises in Europe to support NATO allies. In a long-shot bid to raise $20 billion to expand transit systems and research self-driving cars, Obama will propose a $10-a-barrel tax on crude oil.  The budget will propose boosting spending on cybersecurity by 35 percent to $19 billion and creating a $3.1 billion fund to modernize the governments creaky information technology systems. Obama will seek a 20 percent boost for renewable energy research funding to a total of $7.7 billion. Obama will propose a $2.5 billion tax credit over five years for businesses that invest in community college programs and 05:00:then hire their graduates. The White House will ask for $1.8 billion in emergency funding to prepare for the Zika virus, work on tests and vaccines, and assist Puerto Rico and countries grappling with the outbreak. Obama will seek an 11 percent hike in funding for the Securities and Exchange Commission to $1.8 billion and 32 percent increase for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to $330 million. The budget will propose a 1.6 percent pay increase for military and civilian federal personnel. Obama will ask for $1.1 billion in new funding to expand treatment for people addicted to heroin and prescription painkillers, a growing epidemic. Obama pledged more than $450 million in aid to Colombia to help with security and integrating rebel combatants into society under a pending peace deal to end Latin Americas longest war. Obama will propose $12 billion over 10 years to supplement food stamps for poor families when school meal programs are closed in the summer, $2 billion in emergency aid for families in crisis, a combined $328 million in education and housing grants to poor neighborhoods, and a $15 million pilot program to help poor families move to better neighborhoods. The budget will include three years of federal funding to 19 state governments that passed up an earlier offer to expand Medicaid coverage for more than 4 million low-income people. Obama will ask for tweaks to a tax on certain health insurance plans that is unpopular with labor unions. The White House will ask for $5.5 billion in incentives for businesses that hire young people and $200 million for apprenticeship programs. Obama will propose $4 billion for states and $100 million for school districts to expand computer science in schools. The budget will include $1 billion over five years to help coal-mining regions with economic development. The White House will ask for $755 million for Vice President Joe Bidens moonshot effort to find new cancer treatments. The budget will include $700 million in agricultural research grants, double the spending level in 2016. Obama has proposed $500 million to boost access to mental healthcare as part of his push to address gun violence. Obama will propose $95 million for a new office responsible for background checks for federal employees. As part of reforms to the criminal justice system, Obama will ask for $24 million for better housing for inmates with serious mental illnesses. Obama will propose tax credits for small businesses offering 401(k) plans or expanding access to retirement savings programs. Obama will seek to expand unemployment insurance to more types of workers, provide wage insurance for workers moving to lower-paid positions, and provide incentives to states for retraining or relocating workers. Obama will ask for funding to hire 200 new ATF staff to enforce gun laws. ",politicsNews,"February 9, 2016 ",1
Woman who accused Bill Clinton of assault to campaign against Hillary presidential run,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - One of the women who has accused former U.S. President Bill Clinton of sexual assault says she has agreed to work for an anti-Clinton political group being formed by a former advisor to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Kathleen Willey, a former White House volunteer who says Bill Clinton groped her in an Oval Office hallway in 1993 when she came to him tearfully seeking a paid job, said she had agreed to become a paid national spokeswoman for a group being created by Roger Stone. Stone, a Republican strategist, said the group would become active should Hillary Clinton, Bill Clintons wife, win the Democratic nomination in the 2016 race for the White House. Clinton is currently the front runner.  This gives me more of an opportunity to get this message out to young voters who werent even born or dont even remember what happened and to the women who have suffered, Willey told Reuters. Willey said she will give interviews and speeches and appear in political advertisements to ensure the accusations remain part of the political discourse during the election campaign.  Theyre going to be confronted every day, on radio, on television, on billboards, Stone told Reuters, referring to the Clintons. He said he had reached a verbal agreement with Willey  but cautioned that the group was still in the planning stages.  Spokesmen for Hillary and Bill Clinton did not respond to questions about Willey. Stones political action committee, which can raise virtually unlimited funds to advocate for or against candidates, was originally created last year under the name Women Against Hillary. It was renamed in January as the Rape Accountability Project for Education PAC, or RAPE PAC.  In a 1998 deposition, Clinton emphatically denied Willeys accusation he groped her, describing her as having been through a lot in reference to her familys financial woes and her husbands suicide on the day Willey says her encounter with Clinton happened. Clinton has admitted having extra-marital affairs with two other women: Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, and Gennifer Flowers, a singer and actor from his home state of Arkansas, but he and his lawyers have said accusations by other women are false. Its not clear whether Stones group will resonate with voters. A Reuters/Ipsos poll in January found that a majority of the public, including 68 percent of Democrats and 50 percent of Republicans, thought that Bill Clintons past sexual misconduct made no difference in the current race.   Among women, 56 percent said it did not matter, while another 21 percent said it would hurt Hillary Clintons chances of winning the election. Several Republican candidates, particularly Trump, have reminded voters of the allegations while campaigning. The Clintons and their staff have dismissed this as dirty politics. Hillary Clintons decision to advocate for victims of sexual assault has persuaded some of her husbands other accusers, including Juanita Broaddrick and Paula Jones McFadden, to wade into the political season. Broaddrick and Willey say that Clinton, who has said victims of sexual assault have the right to be believed, is being hypocritical by doubting her husbands accusers. When asked about the accusations by Broaddrick, Jones McFadden and Willey at a campaign event in New Hampshire in December, Hillary Clinton replied that people who say they were sexually assaulted should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence.  Stone released a book last year called The Clintons War on Women, for which Willey wrote the foreword. After leaving Trumps campaign, Stone created a pro-Trump political action committee, the Committee to Restore Americas Greatness. He says he remains friendly with Trump. Trump himself, angered at Hillary Clinton calling him sexist, described Bill Clinton as one of the great women abusers of all time and Hillary Clinton his enabler at a campaign event last month. A spokeswoman for Trump, who is barred by Federal Election Commission rules from coordinating with super PACs, did not respond to questions. Stone has also helped to set up an online fundraising page to help raise money to pay for Willeys mortgage, he said. She said she has been in financial difficult since her husbands suicide and is facing foreclosure on her Virginia home this month.

Trump versus Jeb in New Hampshire on day before crucial primary,"MANCHESTER, N.H. (Reuters) - White House hopefuls Donald Trump and Jeb Bush opened political hostilities on Monday as Republican and Democratic candidates stormed across New Hampshire in a final flurry of events before the states crucial first-in-the-nation primary. The stage was set for the vote on Tuesday, with New York billionaire Trump enjoying a big lead in opinion polls of the states Republican voters and a host of rivals jockeying to emerge as his chief challenger for the Republican presidential nomination in the Nov. 8 election. In the race for the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders from neighboring Vermont sought to hang on for a much-needed victory over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton a week after a razor-thin loss to her in the Iowa caucuses. Sanders told a crowd of about 500 people in Nashua that his call to eradicate income inequality and level the economic playing field for lower- and middle-class workers was resonating. Im here today to ask your support, to join us in making that political revolution, he said. Polls showed his big New Hampshire lead tightening but still sizable. Clinton hoped to make the finish close in a feat much like her husbands, former President Bill Clinton, in 1992 when he declared himself the Comeback Kid.  For those of you who are still deciding, still shopping, I hope I can close the deal, Clinton said at Manchester Community College, campaigning with her raspy-voiced husband and daughter Chelsea. Clinton was reported by Politico to be pondering a staff shakeup out of concern at the messaging of her campaign. I have no idea what theyre talking about or who they are talking to, Clinton, responding to the report, said on MSNBC. Were going to take stock, but its going to be the campaign that Ive got. Im very confident in the people that I have.  A snowstorm swept across the state but it did not slow down the last, tense full day of campaigning ahead of the primary. Trump, still rankled that Bush hit him hard at a candidates debate in Manchester on Saturday night, peppered his stump speeches with attacks on the former Florida governor at events in Salem and Londonderry. This stiff, Jeb Bush, Trump said. Hes a total stiff. ... If you had a company, you wouldnt even hire him. Hes like a child, like a spoiled child. Bush fired off a tweet referring to Trumps comment last summer that Senator John McCain, the partys 2008 presidential nominee who spent 5-1/2 years in a North Vietnamese prisoner of war camp, was not a hero because he got captured. @realDonaldTrump, you arent just a loser, you are a liar and a whiner. John McCain is a hero. Over and out, Bush said. Senator Marco Rubios shaky performance at Saturdays debate gave hope to his rivals that the Floridians rise after a strong third-place finish in Iowa could be blunted.  Bush, Ohio Governor John Kasich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie are fighting to finish strongly enough in New Hampshire to justify staying in the race and taking their campaigns to South Carolina, which holds its primary on Feb. 20. As the New Hampshire polls stand now, Trump would win and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who won Iowa; Rubio; Kasich; Bush; and Christie would end right behind him in a tight bunch. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and businesswoman Carly Fiorina are also in the race. Rubio wilted under an attack by Christie at the debate, repeating rehearsed lines from his stump speech in defending himself against criticism that he is not experienced enough to be president. The moment triggered commentary comparing Rubio to a robot, both in the news media and on social media. Rubios point was that even though he is a first-term senator, he should not be compared to Democratic President Barack Obama, who was a first-term senator when elected in 2008. He said at the debate that Obama has pushed the country in the wrong direction because of his political beliefs, not from inexperience. The core of this campaign is that statement, and I am going to continue to say it: Barack Obama is deliberately carrying out a strategy to change America: He wants to redefine this country, Rubio said on CBSs This Morning.

"Before New Hampshire primary, Trump campaign shows mellower side ","PLYMOUTH, N.H. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump came to the small town of Plymouth in the New Hampshire mountains on Sunday and promised to lower prescription drug prices, improve education and help heroin addicts get treatment.  It was a day after he told a Republican debate audience that he did not want to leave poor people dying in the streets, and won praise by some pundits for delivering a restrained performance in which he largely avoided skewering his rivals.  It is not as if Trump, notorious for his inflammatory, demolition-derby style, has suddenly gone soft. At the same event in Plymouth, he reaffirmed his support for reviving the waterboarding of terrorism suspects and, if necessary, doing much worse. He mocked poor Jeb Bush and talked about the stupid people running the government.  But the past week has revealed a mellower Trump who seems less interested in slashing and burning his way to his partys nomination for the Nov. 8 election and more willing to view his competitors with equanimity. His campaign has been working to moderate his image, showing another side of the boastful billionaire businessman whose candidacy has alarmed the Republican establishment and been marked by calls for the deportation of illegal immigrants and temporarily banning Muslims from entering the United States.  The effort began in earnest in Iowa, when Trump brought in an evangelical leader as a character witness, used his children as surrogates and stood on stage with his wife, Melania, who has been rarely seen on the campaign trail. He told Reuters in Iowa he was nervous about the result of the caucuses, where he ended up second to Ted Cruz, the U.S. senator from Texas, in the first of the state-by-state nominating contests. Ahead of New Hampshires pivotal primary on Tuesday in which Trump leads in opinion polls, he has shared painful personal stories, stopped at diners to shake hands with patrons, and tried sending the message that despite his massive wealth and brash manner, he is a regular Joe.   Trump even admitted on CNN on Sunday that Saturdays debate was a lot of pressure.  Hes much more of an ordinary guy than (voters) would ever expect, Trumps son, Donald Trump Jr., said at a campaign stop in Tipton, New Hampshire. Hes a down-to-earth guy.  New Hampshire voters have rewarded candidates for emotional directness before. In 1992, they gave Democrat Bill Clintons flagging campaign new life when he went on television with his wife, Hillary, amid denied having an extramarital affair. Sixteen years later, they handed Hillary Clinton a much-needed win after she broke down at an event and cried. The blunt-spoken Republican John McCain won the states primary twice, in 2000 and 2008.  Despite leading in polls in several early voting states, Trump could use some image enhancement. National polls almost uniformly show that more than 50 percent of Americans view him unfavorably.  During his last weekend in Iowa, Trump abandoned his usual campaign format in which he stands a podium and addresses the crowd in favor of a sit-down with Jerry Falwell Jr., son of the late evangelical activist, in which Trump answered his questions with little bombast. Falwell vouched for Trumps generosity, telling of a couple who helped Trump after his limousine broke down in rural New York and how he in turn paid off their mortgage.  At those events, Trump made a show of presenting a giant fake check, sweepstakes-style, to groups that aid disabled veterans.  I watch all these candidates, he said of his rivals. Im nicer than all of them. In New Hampshire, Trump has opened up about the loss of his older brother to alcoholism in 1981.  My brother Fred was a great guy. I mean, he had everything, Trump said. The most handsome guy. And then he got hooked  and there was nothing, there was nothing we could do about it.  Trump picked up that thread on Sunday in Plymouth, saying:  Were going to take the people who are badly addicted. Were going to work to make them better. Trumps motorcade stopped earlier at a diner in Manchester, where he greeted star-struck patrons, drank hot chocolate and ordered eggs and bacon.  During his appearance in Plymouth, he barely mentioned his competitors and did not mention building a wall along the border with Mexico until someone in the crowd shouted it out. He also resisted taking aim at Marco Rubio, the U.S. senator from Florida, whose faltering performance at Saturdays debate seemed tailor-made for the back of Trumps hand. Instead, Trump told the audience: I love you folks. Youre amazing people. On Tuesday, go out and vote, he said, adding with a grin: If youre not going to vote for me, do not vote.

Obama seeks funds to fight Zika; sees no cause for panic,"WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will ask the U.S. Congress for more than $1.8 billion in emergency funds to fight Zika at home and abroad and pursue a vaccine, the White House said on Monday, but he added there is no reason to panic over the mosquito-borne virus. Zika, spreading rapidly in South and Central America and the Caribbean, has been linked to severe birth defects in Brazil, and public health officials concern is focused on pregnant women and women who may become pregnant. Obamas request to Congress includes $200 million for research, development and commercialization of new vaccines and diagnostic tests for the virus. At least 12 groups are working to develop a vaccine. On Monday, the London-based European Medicines Agency (EMA), Europes drugs regulator, said it established an expert task force to advise companies working on Zika vaccines and medicines, mirroring similar action during the two-year-long  Ebola epidemic that started in December 2013 and the pandemic flu outbreak in 2009. There are no vaccines or treatment for Zika and none even undergoing clinical studies. Most infected people either have no symptoms or develop mild ones like fever and skin rashes. The good news is this is not like Ebola; people dont die of Zika. A lot of people get it and dont even know that they have it, Obama told CBS News in an interview aired on Monday. But there shouldnt be panic on this. This is not something where people are going to die from it. It is something we have to take seriously. Most of the money sought by Obama, who faces pressure from Republicans and some fellow Democrats to act decisively on Zika, would be spent in the United States on testing, surveillance and response in affected areas, including the creation of rapid-response teams to contain outbreak clusters. At a White House briefing, Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said she was not expecting large-scale amounts of serious Zika infections in the continental United States as warmer months bring larger and more active mosquito populations. We do think its likely that we will have limited local transmission in some of the southern states, Schuchat said. Obamas funding request to Congress includes $335 million for the U.S. Agency for International Development to support mosquito-control, maternal health and other Zika-related public health efforts in affected countries in the Americas. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the White House briefing a vaccine likely would not be widely available for a few years. Fauci said he anticipated beginning a so-called Phase 1 trial this summer for a Zika vaccine that would take about three months to test if it is safe and induces a good immune response before further studies can be conducted. The CDC said its Zika emergency operations center, with a staff of 300, has been placed on its highest level of activation, reflecting a need for accelerated preparedness for possible local virus transmission by mosquitoes in the continental United States. Some lawmakers have urged Obama to name a Zika czar to head U.S. efforts against the virus, but Fauci said he sees no need right now for such an appointment. Much remains unknown about Zika, including whether the virus actually causes microcephaly, a condition marked by abnormally small head size that can result in developmental problems. Brazil is investigating the potential link between Zika infections and more than 4,000 suspected cases of microcephaly.  Researchers have identified evidence of Zika infection in 17 of these cases, either in the baby or in the mother, but have not confirmed that Zika can cause microcephaly. Word that Zika can be spread by sexual transmission and blood transfusions and its discovery in saliva and urine of infected people have added to concern over the virus.  The World Health Organization declared the outbreak an international health emergency on Feb. 1, citing a strongly suspected relationship between Zika infection in pregnancy to microcephaly. Brazil is grappling with the virus even as it prepares to host the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in August, with tens of thousands of athletes and tourists anticipated. The U.S. Olympic Committee has told U.S. sports federations that athletes and staff concerned about their health due to Zika should consider not going to the Olympics. The message was delivered in a conference call involving USOC officials and leaders of U.S. sports federations in late January. Former Olympian Donald Anthony, president and board chairman of USA Fencing, said, One of the things that they immediately said was, especially for women that may be pregnant or even thinking of getting pregnant, that whether you are scheduled to go to Rio or no, that you shouldnt go. At the White House, Fauci said athletes would need to make a personal decision about whether or not to skip the Olympics.   ",politicsNews,"February 8, 2016 ",1

Former NYC Mayor Bloomberg says eyeing 2016 run for president: FT,"(Reuters) - Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, said he is considering running for U.S. president in 2016, the Financial Times reported on Monday. The 73-year-old founder of the eponymous financial information group was critical of the quality of debate in the presidential contest and said he was looking at all the options when asked whether he was considering a run, the newspaper said. I find the level of discourse and discussion distressingly banal and an outrage and an insult to the voters, Bloomberg told the Financial Times in an interview, adding that the U.S. public deserved a lot better. Bloomberg has told aides to draw up plans for an independent campaign for the U.S. presidency, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Jan. 23, confirming a report in the New York Times. He would be willing to spend at least $1 billion of his own money on a campaign for the November 2016 election, according to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the former mayors thinking. Bloomberg has given himself an early March deadline for entering the race, the source said, after commissioning a poll in December to see how he would fare against Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the Republican and Democratic front-runners. No third-party candidate has ever won a U.S. presidential election. But Bloomberg, who has close Wall Street ties and liberal social views, sees an opening for his candidacy if Republicans nominate Trump or Texas Senator Ted Cruz and the Democrats nominate Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, the source said.    A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed a third-party presidential run by Bloomberg would be a long shot but could help real estate mogul Donald Trump if he lands the Republican nomination. In a matchup between Trump and Clinton, adding Bloombergs name to the ballot would trim Clintons lead over Trump to six percentage points from 10, according to the poll conducted from Jan. 23 to Jan. 27. In a matchup pitting Trump versus Sanders, adding Bloomberg would erode Sanders lead over Trump to seven points from 12, the poll results showed. In all matchups, Bloomberg himself would land just 10 percent or less of the vote in November. The 73-year-old financial information industry billionaire, who earned a reputation as a social liberal with strong Wall Street ties during his time as New York City mayor, has considered a White House run for years.

Clinton campaign denies staffing changes in works,"WASHINGTON/MANCHESTER, N.H. (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintons campaign chair denied a Monday report that she is considering staff changes after the New Hampshire nominating contest on Tuesday. There is zero truth to what you may be reading. Its wrong. Hillary stands behind her team, period, Chairman John Podesta tweeted. Podesta was responding to a Politico report that Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had planned to reassess staffing and strategy after the first four primaries but are becoming increasingly critical of their aides and demanded the evaluation sooner. The former secretary of state would be more inclined to add new staff rather than fire current employees, according to the Politico story, which cited six unnamed sources. Clinton, once the clear front-runner for the Democratic nomination, has lost ground to challenger Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who is expected to win the New Hampshire primary. Last week she narrowly beat Sanders in the Iowa caucuses, the first nominating contest for the Nov. 8 election. Asked by MSNBC about the Politico story, Clinton said: I have no idea what theyre talking about or who they are talking to. Were going to take stock, but its going to be the campaign that Ive got, Clinton said in the interview with MSNBC. Im very confident in the people that I have. Im very committed to them. Theyre committed to doing the best we can, she said.  (Reporting by Megan Cassella and Amanda Becker; Editing by Mohammad Zargham and Cynthia Osterman) SAP is the sponsor of this content.

Potential New Hampshire spoiler Kasich could pose threat to Rubio  ,"MANCHESTER, N.H. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate John Kasich is polling in the low single digits nationally but may be poised to play the role of spoiler in Tuesdays New Hampshire primary by cutting into the support of higher-profile rivals such as Marco Rubio.  The Ohio governor, who is vowing to erase the U.S. budget deficit without shredding the safety net for poor Americans, has built a base of support among moderate Republicans and independent voters, who wield special clout in New Hampshire because they can vote in either partys primary. Kasich, 63, has the support of about 12 to 14 percent of New Hampshires voters in recent polls. The former congressman has staked the viability of his White House aspirations on New Hampshire, whose pivotal primary is part of the state-by-state contests to pick the party nominees for the Nov. 8 election to replace Democratic President Barack Obama. While well behind billionaire real estate mogul Donald Trump, Kasichs poll numbers are close to those of Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida who is seeking to build on his momentum after a third-place finish in last Mondays Iowa caucuses behind Trump and winner Ted Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas. I found great clarity here in New Hampshire, Kasich said on Sunday in Concord. These town halls, you know, theyre getting bigger and I dont know how I feel about them getting bigger.  The event marked his 102nd town hall in the state. For the 100th, in Bedford on Friday, the campaign celebrated with confetti and a cake that was served to voters attending the event. Kasich told stories of personal connections he said he had made with voters at town halls, including with a woman whose daughter has struggled with addiction.  She said: My daughter has been sober for 11 months, Kasich said, asking the crowd: Do you have any idea what this ladys life is like?  He added he had promised to call the daughter and tell her: Your mom is counting on you. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll put Kasichs support nationally at 3.4 percent. Kasich himself jokes about his lack of name recognition, saying voters often mispronounce his last name. But among New Hampshire voters, a Monmouth University poll released on Sunday found Kasich at 14 percent, compared with 30 percent for Trump and 13 percent for Rubio and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Rubio was criticized last year by Republican strategists who said he had not done enough to woo voters in New Hampshire in intimate settings such as coffee shops and town halls. This year, however, he has campaigned intensively in the state and often holds town halls. But Rubio came under heavy attack in the Republican presidential debate on Saturday from rivals who accused him of being too inexperienced for the White House. Kasich delivered a positive message during the debate that could appeal to New Hampshire Republican voters, who famously make up their minds late and never seem in the mood to follow the lead of the Iowa caucuses.  Some of Kasichs supporters are passionate about him.  Its authenticity, brother. You have my vote, one man told him at the Bedford town hall. Others were weighing their options. Tim Vanblommesteyn, 62, who attended the Kasich town hall in Concord, said he was disgusted with both political parties but liked some of what the Ohio governor had to say. The small-business owner and self-described independent praised Kasich for taking what he said was a principled stand on immigration reform, an issue that has aroused fiery campaign rhetoric, including from Trump, who has called for deporting illegal immigrants. Kasich has said the United States should secure its borders but that illegal immigrants who have not committed a crime should be able to pay back taxes and get on a path to legalization. Anne Brena, 53, a Democrat from neighboring Vermont, said she came to the Concord event to learn more about the governor. Brena said she thought Democrat Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from her home state, was too liberal to win the general election and she has concerns that his rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, has too much baggage to win the White House. John Kasich is the only Republican that sounds reasonable, she said.

"Obama to call for increases in budget for SEC, CFTC: White House","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obamas fiscal 2017 budget will call for an 11 percent increase in funding for the Securities and Exchange Commission and a 32 percent increase for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a White House official said on Monday. Obama will propose that the SEC be given $1.8 billion and the CFTC $330 million in the budget, economic adviser Jeffrey Zients said in a blog post on the White House website. Last year the Administration fought hard to keep Congressional Republicans from using must-pass budget legislation to roll back Wall Street Reform, he wrote, referring to fiscal 2016. We also fought to increase funding for financial regulators and to maintain their independence. But even these gains arent enough. And while the Administration is pushing for more funding for these regulators, well also continue to oppose efforts to restrict the funding independence of the other financial regulators, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, he wrote.  The Republican-controlled Congress is likely to oppose these and many other proposals in Obamas budget. In addition to the proposed increases from the previous fiscal year, the budget will offer support again for user fees to fund the CFTC in a similar way to other financial regulators, Zients said. Fee funding would shift the costs of regulatory services provided by the CFTC from the taxpayer to the very firms that benefit from the CFTCs oversight. This is a commonsense change that is long overdue, he said. The budget would also take steps to reduce risk in the financial sector by assessing a fee against large financial institutions based on their liabilities. We learned the hard way in 2008 just how damaging risk and leverage in the financial system can be, and weve done a lot to curb excessive risk on Wall Street since, Zients said, referring to the global financial crisis. This fee is another way to further those reforms, ensuring that taxpayers arent on the hook for risky Wall Street gambles. Federal fiscal 2017 begins on Oct. 1 of this year.

Lawyers see limited legal options for workers sent in Zika's way,"(Reuters) - Employees of U.S. companies seeking to avoid exposure to the Zika virus likely have few legal avenues to either refuse travel to affected areas or sue if they actually become sick from the virus. But it may be a different story if such workers subsequently give birth to Zika-infected babies. Since Zika was detected in Brazil last year, the mosquito-borne virus has spread to 33 countries, most of them in the Americas.  The World Health Organization declared an international health emergency because of strong suspicions that infections in pregnant women may cause microcephaly, a condition in which infants are born with abnormally small heads and can suffer developmental problems.     While the virus had typically caused mild symptoms in adults, it also has been linked to an autoimmune disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome that can cause paralysis. U.S. and world health authorities are not currently warning against all travel to affected areas, as they did with the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. They are, however, advising pregnant women to consider postponing travel, and all travelers to take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.    Adherence to the recommendations of the U.S. Department of State or the World Health Organization would shield companies to a large degree from claims they acted recklessly in sending employees into Zika-affected areas, lawyers who typically represent employers say.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) further recommends that travelers wear insect repellent and sleep with mosquito nets in places where they might be bitten, among other measures.     Your defense to any sort of claim is that you follow the public health guidance, said Mark Lies, a lawyer with the firm Seyfarth Shaw, which specializes in advising companies on employment issues.     Such advisories also mean workers probably would not be protected from termination if they refuse to go to an affected area, lawyers said. While the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act gives workers the right to refuse dangerous tasks, those tasks must pose an immediate risk of death or serious injury. Something like working with a defective tool that has electrical sparks coming out of it would meet that standard, said Ben Huggett of Littler, another employment law firm. Traveling to a Zika-affected area, on the other hand, would probably not, he said. Lies said upgraded warnings in the event Zika proves more lethal or virulent could give workers more of a right to refuse travel. But he said OSHA affords no special protection for pregnant women under current threat levels. The law governs only the safety of employees, not any unborn children they may be carrying.     If employees contract Zika while traveling on the job, any immediate harm they suffer would be covered by workers compensation insurance, a form of no-fault insurance that applies to injuries suffered on the job. Virtually all states require employers to obtain workers compensation insurance and mandate that it be the sole remedy for workplace injuries. Workers compensation covers lost wages and medical care but awards are typically smaller than private lawsuits, which can seek to recover damages for pain and suffering, as well as punitive damages for negligence.   Whether workers compensation would cover any purported Zika-related injuries in an employees baby is less clear. Huggett said that a fetal injury might be covered as being derivative of the mothers injury. Huggett said he was unaware of any case that directly addressed workers compensation for a fetus harmed by an infectious disease.    Its really an open question, he said.     Lies said he did not believe workers compensation would generally cover injury to a fetus but thought it could open the door for an employee to bring a lawsuit against her employer for negligence.     If someone is pregnant, or trying to get pregnant, or could get pregnant, you could have a case, said Katherine Dudley Helms, a lawyer with employment law firm Ogletree Deakins.     Many states limit workers compensation to several years pay, while a damage award for a severely impaired child could reach tens of millions of dollars, according to Michael Jones, an employment lawyer with Reed Smith. Michael Gerson of California firm Boxer & Gerson, who brings claims on behalf of employees, said such a case would still be a challenge if the company followed official warnings. The evidence would have to show that the mother was never given adequate warning to protect herself as she was going into this type of environment, he said. But Jones said such cases would be tough for the employer too. I would be concerned if I sent an employee to a high risk region, he said. If that claim gets in front of a jury, youre going to be looking at a very sympathetic plaintiff. Reuters reported last week that several international airlines are allowing flight crew members who are or may become pregnant to request reassignment to routes that avoid Zika-affected areas.  A spokeswoman for one of the airlines, American(AAL.O), declined to comment on possible legal liability requiring such travel could have created, saying the companys policy was motivated by concern for employees well-being. United(UAL.N) and Delta(DAL.N), which have also offered to reassign their employees, could not immediately be reached.     ",politicsNews,"February 8, 2016 ",1
"Obama, Canada's Trudeau discuss fight against Islamic State: White House","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama spoke by telephone on Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about Canadas role in the international effort to combat Islamic State, the White House said.

Corporate winners of Obama budget still face long odds,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facing a hostile Congress in an election year, President Barack Obama will be hard-pressed to push through many of the proposals in his final budget as U.S. leader.  But that could be a silver lining for investors: If the long-shot plans gain traction, companies that stand to win new business or funding from proposed spending, such as auto suppliers, hospital chains and construction firms, could get an unexpected boost to their shares. Some details of the budget plan, set to be unveiled on Tuesday, already are known. It will include $4 billion over 10 years for development of safe-driving vehicles, an area already of interest to many companies.  Added funding could benefit suppliers such as Delphi Automotive, Autoliv and Mobileye, which are developing safety features for autonomously driven cars, and Lear, which makes electrical power systems, according to Brian Sponheimer, analyst at Gabelli & Co. The market discounts that any proposals by this administration will be if not ignored, then outright put down, Sponheimer said. There clearly is upside if it passes, but there is a very healthy skepticism that that is likely to take place. Obamas plan to fund an overhaul of the nations infrastructure through a $10-a-barrel tax on crude oil could also boost engineering and construction firms such as Granite Construction said Morris Ajzenman, an analyst at Griffin Securities. But I give very very little probability that it comes to pass. Similarly, Ipsita Smolinski, managing director at healthcare research consulting firm Capitol Street, said it was doubtful the Republican Congress would approve Obamas plan to aid the 19 state governments that passed up an earlier offer to expand the Medicaid program for low-income Americans. Such a plan, she said, would benefit hospital companies including Tenet Healthcare and HCA Holdings and Medicaid insurers such as Centene and Molina Healthcare. More palatable to Congress could be Obamas push for $755 million to jumpstart cancer research. But that level of investment without being more targeted may not benefit any specific firms, given that so many drug and biotech companies are invested in developing cancer therapies. Major defense contractors - including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and General Dynamics - stand to benefit from the budget, said Sterne Agee CRT analyst Peter Arment. Its an election year, national security is at the top of the priority list and a lot of elected officials  they dont want to be tied to cutting defense, Arment said.

"Exclusive: Presidential hopefuls Sanders, Clinton in dead heat - Reuters/Ipsos poll","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has erased Secretary of State Hillary Clintons wide lead for the Democratic presidential nomination since the start of year, putting the two in a dead heat nationally, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Clinton leads Sanders 48 percent to 45 percent among Democratic voters, according to the poll of 512 Americans, conducted Feb. 2-5 following the Iowa caucus. The poll has a credibility interval of 5 percentage points. Democrats had been supporting Clinton by more than a 2-to-1 margin at the beginning of the year. Sanders has narrowed that lead considerably over the past several weeks. Clinton beat Sanders narrowly in the Iowa caucuses, the nations first nomination contest ahead of the November election, but is expected to lose to him in New Hampshire. The two rivals clashed on Thursday night in their first one-on-one debate, reflecting the tightness of the race.  There is still a wide gap between the two in name recognition nationally. Nearly a quarter of Democrats and two-fifths of Independents say they are still not that familiar with Sanders. In comparison, Clinton has almost total name recognition among voters.  On the Republican side, Donald Trump continued to lead the field with 40 percent support. His level of support among Republicans was relatively unchanged following his second-place finish in the Iowa caucus. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas followed with 16 percent and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida came in third with 13 percent.  * Democrat poll results: bit.ly/1Ppdeh2 * Republican poll results: bit.ly/1URswih For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, Tales from the Trail (here).

Democratic donor contacts Biden allies about possible run,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A prominent Democratic donor worried about the partys chances of winning the presidency emailed dozens of fans of Vice President Joe Biden on Friday, urging them to remain prepared to donate if Biden jumps into the race. The donor, Bill Bartmann, cited new polling showing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont nearly tied with the Hillary Clinton, eroding the 30-point lead the former secretary of state held at the end of last year. Bartmann and other party insiders are concerned that Sanders, a self-proclaimed Democratic socialist, is too far to the left to win against a Republican in the Nov. 8 presidential election.  We cannot afford to lose the White House, Bartmann wrote in the email, seen by Reuters.  The email drew a string of affirmative responses, also seen by Reuters. Biden announced in October that he would not seek the presidency, despite support from a group of backers under the name Draft Biden 2016. But whispers have continued among some donors who hope that Biden could be convinced to run after all should Clintons campaign prove fruitless. My sitting on the sidelines has a lot to do with my disappointment that the vice president decided not to get in the race, Patrick Baskette, one of the recipients of Bartmanns email, told Reuters. Baskette, a public affairs consultant in Tampa, Florida, was a special assistant to Biden during his time as a senator.  Baskette said he was not opposed to either Clinton or Sanders. I dont think that they offer the solutions to our nations future that Joe Biden does, he added.     Clinton only barely squeaked out a win against Sanders in the Iowa caucus this week, adding to fears that she could lose a nomination that once was thought all but inevitable for her. Clinton is widely expected to lose the New Hampshire primary to Sanders on Tuesday. Count me in, Gary Hindes, chief executive of the Delaware Bay Company LLC and a former chairman of the Delaware Democratic Party, wrote on the email chain.  I am hoping that the stars line up right and that Joe becomes the nominee, Hindes said to Reuters. Sanders is too far to the left, he added, saying Clinton could be vulnerable as well.  My heart is with Joe, Hindes said.      (Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Leslie Adler) SAP is the sponsor of this content.

Factbox: What will be in Obama's final budget proposal?,"(Reuters) - President Barack Obama is set on Tuesday to unveil his budget proposal for fiscal year 2017, his final year in office.  But since the Republican-controlled Congress controls the purse strings, much of Obamas plan likely will be shelved. The following are some of the proposals that will be included: The Pentagon will ask for more than $7 billion for the fight against Islamic State, up about 35 percent from the previous years budget request to Congress, and wants a fourfold increase for military training and exercises in Europe to support NATO allies. In a long-shot bid to raise $20 billion to expand transit systems and research self-driving cars, Obama will propose a $10-a-barrel tax on crude oil.  Obama will seek a 20-percent boost for renewable energy research funding to a total of $7.7 billion. Obama will propose a $2.5 billion tax credit over five years for businesses that invest in community college programs and then hire their graduates. The budget will propose a 1.6 percent pay increase for military and civilian federal personnel. Obama will ask for $1.1 billion in new funding to expand treatment for people addicted to heroin and prescription pain killers, a growing epidemic. Obama pledged more than $450 million in aid to Colombia to help with security and integrating rebel combatants into society under a pending peace deal to end Latin Americas longest war. Obama will propose $12 billion over 10 years to supplement food stamps for poor families when school meal programs are closed in the summer, $2 billion in emergency aid for families in crisis, a combined $328 million in education and housing grants to poor neighborhoods, and a $15 million pilot program to help poor families move to better neighborhoods. The budget will include three years of federal funding to 19 state governments that passed up an earlier offer to expand Medicaid coverage for more than 4 million low-income people. Obama will ask for tweaks to a tax on certain health insurance plans that is unpopular with labor unions. The White House will ask for $5.5 billion in incentives for businesses that hire young people and $200 million for apprenticeship programs. Obama will propose $4 billion for states and $100 million for school districts to expand computer science in schools. The budget will include $1 billion over five years to help coal-mining regions with economic development. The White House will ask for $755 million for Vice President Joe Bidens moonshot effort to find new cancer treatments. The budget will include $700 million in agricultural research grants, double the spending level in 2016. Obama has proposed $500 million to boost access to mental healthcare as part of his push to address gun violence. Obama will propose $95 million for a new office responsible for background checks for federal employees. As part of reforms to the criminal justice system, Obama will ask for $24 million for better housing for inmates with serious mental illnesses. Obama will propose tax credits for small businesses offering 401(k) plans or expanding access to retirement savings programs. Obama will seek to expand unemployment insurance to more types of workers, provide wage insurance for workers moving to lower-paid positions, and provide incentives to states for retraining or relocating workers. Obama will ask for funding to hire 200 new ATF staff to enforce gun laws. ",politicsNews,"February 6, 2016 ",1
Clinton slams student loan servicer Navient as misleading,"HENNIKER, N.H. (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said during a student town hall on Saturday that student loan servicer Navient Corp has been misleading people and doing some really terrible things. Their behavior is outrageous, Clinton said at New England College, where she was campaigning ahead of the states nominating contest on Tuesday, Feb. 9. Clintons criticism of the student loan servicer comes after she lost badly among young voters to Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders in last weeks Iowa caucus. She received 11 percent of the vote among 17 to 24 year olds who caucused in Iowa versus 86 percent who supported Sanders, according to a NBC News exit poll. Clintons statements came in the response to a question from the audience related to student debt. Navient is being investigated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over late fees and other matters, the company revealed in an August regulatory filing. We understand the politicization of student loans, but we remain focused on delivering excellent service to our customers, said Navient spokeswoman Patricia Christel in a statement, inviting Clinton to come meet their hardworking employees and learn firsthand about our industry-leading default prevention work.

"Rubio falters in presidential debate, offering hope to rivals","MANCHESTER, N.H. (Reuters) - Republican White House contender Marco Rubio struggled at a debate on Saturday at the worst possible time, potentially confounding his bid to emerge as Donald Trumps chief rival in New Hampshire and giving hope to three rivals desperate for a strong showing.   Under assault from New Jersey Governor Chris Christie over his level of experience as a first-term U.S. senator from Florida, Rubio retreated time and again to canned statements from his stump speech and looked uncomfortably rattled for the first time after seamless performances at seven prior debates. Marco, the thing is this, Christie said during one heated exchange early in the night, when youre president of the United States, when youre a governor of a state, the memorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it doesnt solve one problem for one person.  While Rubio recovered later in the debate, the timing of his performance was terrible, coming three days before New Hampshire Republicans register their choices on Tuesday in the nations second nominating contest. The debate at St. Anselm College was the last face-off of the candidates before the vote. Rubios tough moments may breathe new life into the campaigns of Christie, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Ohio Governor John Kasich, three experienced politicians who, like Rubio, represent establishment Republicans. All three have suffered from the dominance of front-runner  Trump in the Republican race. They are badly in need of a breakout moment to change the trajectory of the battle in New Hampshire, where the polls show Trump in the lead, Rubio in second and Texas Senator Ted Cruz in third place. Trump did not have his best debate. He looked flustered in a fight with Bush over the use of eminent domain in advancing the interests of public use projects and private industry. But he seemed to do well enough to possibly win on Tuesday in what would represent his first victory of the 2016 race, erasing the pain from a loss in the Iowa caucus last week, where he finished second to Cruz and just ahead of the surging Rubio. A victory in New Hampshire could put Trump on track for more wins in South Carolina on Feb. 20 and beyond on the way to the Nov. 8 election. For the second debate in a row, Bush looked polished and sounded like the candidate many establishment Republicans had pinned their hopes on. His problem is it may be too late. Kasich, likely to end his candidacy if he does not do well on Tuesday, delivered a positive message that could appeal to New Hampshire Republican voters, who famously make up their minds late and never seem in the mood to follow the lead of the Iowa caucuses, won by Cruz. The trouble for Rubio began soon after the debate started when the ABC News moderators asked Christie about Rubios experience in the U.S. Senate, and Christie pressed his case. Rubio critics have made much of the fact that his experience is akin to that of much-derided Democratic President Barack Obama, elected in 2008 when a first-term senator.  Rubios defense was that his and Obamas world views are different, not that Obama has simply led the country down the path it is on because of inexperience. Lets dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesnt know what hes doing. He knows exactly what hes doing, Rubio said. When Rubio repeated the same line again, Christie sought to reinforce the charge that Rubio is so inexperienced that he relies on well-worn talking points and cannot think on his feet. There it is. There it is. The memorized 25-second speech. There it is, everybody, Christie said. Rubio repeated the line enough that someone created a Twitter profile called @RubioGlitch that repeated his line about Obama. Bush attacked Trump for using eminent domain, which allows governments to seize private lands for projects for the public good, to help him build casino complexes in Atlantic City. Eminent domain is a frequent target of criticism from conservative and anti-government groups. What Donald Trump did was use eminent domain to try to take the property of an elderly woman on the strip in Atlantic City. That is not public purpose. That is downright wrong, he said. Trump said eminent domain was a good thing and was necessary to building roads, bridges, schools and hospitals. Certainly, its a necessity for our country, he said. He wants to be a tough guy, and it doesnt work very well, Trump said of Bush, telling the son and brother of former presidents to be quiet. When the crowd booed, Trump said, thats all his donors and special interests out there. Trump, known for his tough stances with calls to ban Muslims from visiting the United States and deport immigrants without the proper documents, also called for a more empathetic view of the Republican call to repeal Obamacare insurance coverage for Americans. There will be a certain number of people who will be on the street dying, and as a Republican I dont want that to happen, he said. Trump captured the biggest share of the conversation on Twitter during the debate, winning 33 percent of the conversation followed by Rubio at 20 percent and Cruz at 15 percent.

Trump says New Hampshire win not necessary to secure nomination,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he does not have to win the New Hampshire primary vote on Tuesday to secure the nomination, apparently tamping down expectations despite holding a double-digit lead in that states polls.     The billionaire businessman came in second to Texas Senator Ted Cruz in the Iowa caucuses last week, although polls put him ahead. His candidacy has alarmed the Republican establishment and has been marked by rows, including over his calls for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. No Republican has won the presidential nomination without winning either the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary since the 1970s, but it would not technically be impossible.  Asked whether a loss in New Hampshire would derail his campaign, Trump told the NBC News show Meet the Press: I dont think I need it. I hope that I get it.  I would like to win but I dont know that it is necessary.    Recent opinion polls give him a lead of between 10 and 22 percentage points over the next closest contender.  Trump has built his campaign in part around his self-declared reputation as a winner, and a loss in New Hampshire would intensify doubts that he can translate opinion poll support into votes. He also told Meet the Press that he has spent as much as $50 million less than expected on the campaign so far, in part because the media provides him so much free publicity. People like you put me on. What do I take a commercial for? Trump told the shows moderator, Chuck Todd.

"Trump calls for waterboarding, other methods in U.S. fight against Islamic State","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican White House front-runner Donald Trump said on Sunday he would be open to harsh measures to deal with the threat from Islamic State, including going beyond the controversial interrogation tactic known as waterboarding. In an interview on ABCs This Week program, Trump discussed reviving the tactic and implementing other interrogation techniques, pointing to the recent beheadings of Christians in the Middle East as evidence of the need for stronger interrogation methods for suspected operatives of extremist groups. Were like living in medieval times, he said. If I have to do it and if its up to me, I would absolutely bring back waterboardng. And if its going to be tougher than waterboarding, I would bring that back, too. When pressed by interviewer George Stephanopoulos if that meant the United States employing similar methods of beheading captors, Trump responded: Were going to do things beyond waterboarding, adding, Perhaps, if that happens to come. The issue of waterboarding and other methods of interrogation was raised during Saturday nights New Hampshire Republican debate aired on ABC, with the billionaire businessman saying he would not only revive the controversial methods use, but bring back a hell of a lot worse  if elected. Waterboarding is the practice of pouring water over someones face to mimic drowning as an interrogation tactic. Critics say it is torture, and Democratic President Barack Obama banned use of the method days after taking office in 2009. Trumps rival and a fellow leader in opinion polls, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, said during the debate that he would only allow limited use of the practice but said it did not constitute torture.    Waterboarding was used by the CIA under the Bush administration during the early days of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Its defenders say it helped to keep America safe by garnering more information from captives, but critics argued the method never actually yielded actionable intelligence. Republicans have been critical of Obamas decision to eliminate the practice, saying it telegraphs a position of weakness to the nations enemies and concedes that the United States erred in using waterboarding. On Sunday, Trump argued that the evil nature of modern times required more robust interrogation techniques, saying that U.S. enemies are thriving in the absence of them. They laugh at us.  Our enemies laugh at us, George.  They say waterboarding, they dont even think its a form - you know, they dont even view that as real torture, he said. New Hampshire, where Trump maintains a lead over Republican rivals in the U.S. nominating contest for the Nov. 8 election, casts its primary ballots on Tuesday, the week after Iowa kicked off the process.

"Rubio, Christie and Kasich get more debate traction on social media","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump lost his social media dominance for the first time during the Republican presidential debates as the candidates made their eighth showing Saturday night in New Hampshire. Instead, many on Twitter took to mocking contender Senator Marco Rubio, who came under heavy attack on Saturday from rivals. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie also saw a big bump in his share of the social conversation. By the end of the night, Trump, who has the most followers, still received the largest share of mentions on Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), with 33 percent compared to Rubios 20 percent. Ted Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, came in third, with 15 percent.  But Twitter said an hour into the debate that Rubio was the most tweeted about candidate on the social media platform, marking the first time a candidate other than Trump came out on top within that time frame.  Overall, Rubio received 10 more mentions per minute on Twitter than he did during the last Republican debate on Jan. 28, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph. Three days before New Hampshires primary for the Nov. 8 election, many of the mentions were negative as Rubio became a target for continuing to repeat many of the same lines from his campaign stump speech. Marco, the thing is this, said rival Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, when youre president of the United States, when youre a governor of a state, the memorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it doesnt solve one problem for one person. That moment was measured by Twitter as one of the top social moments of the night. Actress Mia Farrow, @MiaFarrow, tweeted, Rubio keeps saying the same thing. A Marco Rubio Glitch (@RubioGlitch) account also emerged, gaining nearly 1,200 followers as of Saturday night as it parodied Rubio as a robot in tweets in Spanish and English. Rubio also had his worst performance yet with millennials on the popular messaging app Yik Yak, where he had a 44 percent disapproval rating. In contrast, Ohio Governor John Kasich had his best performance with millennials, earning a 41.4 approval rating, and maintaining the largest share of the conversation on Yik Yak. The debate was also a big night on social media for Christie, who has rarely been a top contender in social mentions. According to Brandwatch, a social media analytics firm, he had the second highest percentage of positive social mentions, 61.5 percent, compared to Trumps 62.5 percent. Tyler Freeman (@tyfreem) tweeted, #GOPDebate Chris Christie has been most underrated candidate the whole campaign. He finally stood out tonight. One of the best performances.

Republican U.S. presidential hopefuls say Zika quarantine may be needed,"MANCHESTER, N.H. (Reuters) - Two Republican U.S. presidential hopefuls said on Saturday they would implement quarantines of travelers if necessary to stop the spread of the Zika virus. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who garnered international attention in 2014 when he quarantined a nurse who returned to the United States after treating Ebola patients, said he would not hesitate to do it again.  You bet I would, Christie said during a debate in New Hampshire with other Republican contenders for the White House. Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, said using a quarantine is not a simple issue but if there was evidence that Zika infection is spreading, he too would utilize a quarantine. The Zika virus is carried by mosquitoes, which transmit it  to humans. Two suspected cases of sexual transmission in the United States also raise questions about other ways that Zika may spread. The virus is affecting large parts of Latin American and the Caribbean. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak an international health emergency on Feb. 1, citing a strongly suspected relationship between Zika infection in pregnancy and microcephaly - a condition marked by abnormally small head size that can result in developmental problems.

Judges find two North Carolina congressional districts racially gerrymandered,"(Reuters) - Two of North Carolinas congressional districts were racially gerrymandered in a 2011 redistricting and must be redrawn within two weeks, a U.S. appeals court panel ruled on Friday. The order written by Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Roger Gregory bars elections in the majority black districts, the 1st and the 12th, until the new maps are approved. North Carolina congressional primaries are scheduled for March 15 This Court finds that Congressional Districts 1 and 12 as drawn in the 2011 Congressional Redistricting Plan are unconstitutional, Gregory wrote. The ruling said race had been the main factor when the Republican-controlled legislature redrew the boundaries and state lawmakers were not justified in using that benchmark. Three voters filed suit in 2013 to invalidate the districts. Both are represented by Democrats, with G.K. Butterfield in the 1st, and Alma Adams in the 12th. State Senator Bob Rucho and House member David Lewis, who guided the redistricting plan through the legislature, were quoted on the Raleigh News and Observer website as saying they would appeal the ruling by the three-judge panel.

Struggling Republican Bush brings out the big gun: his mom,"MANCHESTER, N.H./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Jeb Bush brought out his famous family four days before the crucial U.S. presidential primary in New Hampshire, tapping his mother on Friday to scold Republican front-runner Donald Trump over his use of profanity and treatment of women. In a last ditch attempt to make a mark on a Republican primary campaign he was supposed to own, Bush lashed out at both Trump and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, the one-time protege who  has eclipsed Bush as the partys establishment candidate in the 2016 White House race. New opinion polls following Mondays Iowa caucuses showed Trump maintaining a wide lead in New Hampshires primary next Tuesday with Rubio rising into second place in the state as Republicans battle for the nomination in Novembers presidential election.    Bush, the former governor of Florida, leaned on his well-known family for support.  While former President George W. Bush appeared in a new ad praising his brother as having a good heart and a strong backbone, Jeb Bush sat with his mother for an interview with CBS show This Morning. The two attacked Trump as misogynistic and vulgar after he used a four-letter word in a recent campaign appearance. I dont think a president would have ever shouted profanities in a speech in front of thousands of people with kids in the crowd, Jeb Bush said. He does it all the time. His mother lambasted Trump for criticizing Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly after she quizzed him at a Republican debate in August. Trump made comments widely interpreted as referring to her menstrual cycle. I dont know how women can vote for someone who said what he said about Megyn Kelly, Mrs. Bush said. Its terrible. And we knew what he meant, too. Much loved by todays Republicans, the former first lady herself raised eyebrows in 1984 when she reportedly made a derogatory reference to Democratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman on a major party ticket, saying, I cant say it, but it rhymes with rich.     Trump has dismissed Jeb Bush as a low-energy loser. The son and brother of U.S. presidents who was expected to glide to the Republican nomination, Bush trails in the single digits in many national polls.         Mrs. Bush, who was campaigning for her younger son in New Hampshire, said America needs Jeb and drew an implicit contrast to the brash swagger of Trump. Hes got the same values that America seems to have lost. Hes almost too polite. While rivals took aim at him, Trump was forced to miss a rally on Friday in Londonderry, New Hampshire because of a snow storm and was stuck in New York, a spokesman said.  Trump has eschewed much of the one-on-one retail politicking of typical campaigns in favor of large rallies. But in New Hampshire, where voters are used to having candidates close attention, the strategy could hurt. Jeb Bush seized the opportunity to make fun of Trump on Twitter, pointing out that even his mother was able make it out despite the weather.  My 90 year old mother made it out to campaign, he wrote in response to Trumps tweet that he was moving a campaign event to Monday due to a big storm.  The Bushes chatted with people at a diner in Derry, New Hampshire, according to a pool report sent to news outlets. Vote for my boy, Barbara Bush told one table. I havent seen snow in 1,000 years, she said. The snow did not stop Ohio Governor John Kasich either. His campaign sent reporters a video of the candidate in a snowball fight after a town hall. Jeb Bush also stepped up attacks on Rubio as lacking in experience and accomplishments, saying on MSNBC the first-term Florida lawmaker had done nothing in the U.S. Senate. He was not the only one piling on Rubio. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie released satirical videos slamming the Floridian as scripted for repeating himself in interviews and speeches.  And the New Hampshire Union Leader newspapers publisher criticized Rubio in an editorial for presenting himself as a Washington outsider, saying Rubio must think New Hampshire a bunch of rubes. On the positive side for Rubio, he picked up the endorsement of former Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, who dropped out of the Republican race in November. I think hes a principled conservative. I think hes the right guy to lead us forward, Jindal said on Fox News. A Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll released on Friday found that about one-third of likely Republican voters said they could still change their minds. The poll showed Rubio with 19 percent, behind Trumps 29 percent. Kasich came in third with 13 percent, followed by Bush and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz. For the Democrats, opinion polls show U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont with a double-digit lead in New Hampshire over rival Hillary Clinton. Clinton went on the attack against Sanders on Thursday in their most contentious debate yet.

Exclusive: Obama to propose $2.5 billion tax credit for community college investment,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will propose a $2.5 billion tax credit over five years for businesses that invest in programs at local community colleges and hire their graduates, administration officials said on Friday. The proposal, dubbed the Community College Partnership Tax Credit, would require businesses to donate funds for equipment, instruction, or internships related to programs in areas such as healthcare, energy and information technology. Employers that hire students from such programs would get a one-time, $5,000 tax credit per individual brought aboard. The program, to be proposed formally in the presidents fiscal 2017 budget on Tuesday, is meant to shore up community colleges educational offerings, while helping businesses find high-skilled workers in certain fields. Employers can define those skills and help colleges develop the curriculum that teaches them, said James Kvaal, White House deputy director of domestic policy. He estimated the initiative would produce 500,000 highly skilled graduates over five years. Obamas budget requires congressional approval, which is unlikely. Administration officials expressed confidence, however, that the proposal would garner bipartisan support and the idea could gain traction. The idea of ... bringing together community colleges and the local employer base is a very powerful one and really doesnt break along party lines, said Ted Mitchell, under secretary at the U.S. Department of Education. Obamas final budget is likely to garner less attention than in previous years. Washingtons focus is moving to the 2016 presidential campaign and the Republican-controlled Congress does not want to hand legislative victories to the White House. Administration officials are aware similar proposals by the president have had limited success. Though his proposals to raise the minimum wage and make community college tuition free have not been enacted nationally, they say his championing of such ideas has spurred action on the state and local level. Under his latest proposal, states would get part of the tax credit money and be responsible for selecting businesses and community colleges based on a competition for applications. Employers could be involved in designing curriculums on advanced manufacturing, for example, or donating instruction time and equipment. Community colleges would get needed capital investment and businesses would recoup their investments through the tax credits gleaned from hiring graduates.

Sanders supporters banned from Tinder after campaigning on dating app ,"(Reuters) - Stumping for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Tinder is getting some women banned from the online dating app after sending campaign messages to prospective matches. Two women - one from Iowa and the other from New Jersey - confirmed to Reuters on Friday that they received notices from Tinder in the previous 24 hours that their accounts were locked because they had been reported too many times for peppering men on the site with messages promoting Sanders candidacy. Robyn Gedrich, 23, said she sent messages to 60 people a day for the past two weeks trying to convince them to support the U.S. senator from Vermont in his race for the Democratic nomination against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.   Do you feel the bern? her message to other Tinder users read, parroting a Sanders campaign slogan. Please text WORK to 82623 for me. Thanks. Gedrich, an assistant store manager at retailer Elie Tahari who lives in Brick, New Jersey, said a text would prompt people to start receiving updates from the Sanders campaign, as well as a link where they could sign up and volunteer. She has been unable to sign back into Tinder since logging off on Thursday. Haley Lent, 22,a photographer from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, told Reuters in a Twitter message that she also got locked out of the app on Thursday night after sending messages trying to convince people to vote for Sanders the previous night. Lent, who is married, said she talked to 50 to 100 people on the app. She had even bought a Tinder premium membership, which allows users to change their location, for a month so that she could reach people in New Hampshire and promote Sanders.  I would ask them if they were going to vote in their upcoming primaries, she said. If they said no or were on the fence, I would try to talk to them and persuade them to vote. A spokeswoman for Tinder, which is part of Match Group Inc, owned by IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC.O), did not respond immediately to a request for comment. The two women are not the only ones making unusual use of Tinder, better known as a hook-up app, as a campaign tool. A Facebook (FB.O) group Bernie Sanders Dank Tinder Convos has 782 members. On Yahoos YHOO.O Tumblr microblogging site, a thread titled Tinder Campaigning, The adventures of a perpetual right-swiper in the efforts of electing Bernie Sanders has dozens of conversations referencing Sanders pulled from Tinder. Swiping right is a colloquial reference to approving of a potential match on Tinder. Gedrich said she got mixed responses from the 300 Tinder users who replied. Some people would ask what is this for, and I would kind of explain, she said. Some of them would unmatch me or report me as a bot. A bot (or robot) account is a scam profile used to send spam messages. Some responses simply read, Trump2016, expressing support for Republican candidate Donald Trump, the real estate tycoon. It was really alarming to see that a lot of people dont know whats going on in the world, she said.  None of her matches resulted in an actual date, she said.

Special Report: Why Obama and other gun control advocates own stock in firearms makers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Barack Obama might seem an unlikely investor in the firearms industry. But the U.S. president, a fierce advocate for gun regulation, has money in a pension fund that holds stock in gun and ammunition companies. Although Obamas stake is minuscule, worth no more than $30, it reflects a much larger surge of investment. The president is among millions of Americans buying into gun companies - often unwittingly - as mutual funds have increased such holdings to record levels, according to a Reuters analysis of institutional investment in firearms companies. Since Obama was elected in 2009, mutual funds have raised their stakes to about $510 million from $30 million in the nations two largest gun manufacturers with publicly traded shares, Smith & Wesson Corp SWHC.O and Sturm, Ruger & Co (RGR.N). That means such stocks are now common in retirement and college savings plans.  The influx has helped to boost both companies shares by more than 750 percent during the Obama presidency; each now has a market value of about $1 billion. Beyond mutual funds, such investments also are held in the portfolios of hedge funds and public pension plans, which are harder to track. The White House declined to comment on Obamas holdings in the Illinois General Assemblys pension plan, which he earned while serving in that states senate. The president has disclosed between $50,000 and $100,000 in the plan.  Other indirect investors in firearms companies include advocates for gun regulation in the U.S. Congress and several parents of children who attended Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut - site of the 2012 massacre of 20 students and six staff members.  Fund managers are drawn to the stocks by surging sales. Buyers are arming themselves, analysts said, in response to mass shootings and calls for tougher gun laws. By the end of 2015, more than 150 mutual funds owned Smith & Wesson shares, up from 53 at the end of 2008, and nearly 130 held stock in Ruger, up from 52, according to data from Morningstar Inc. It would have taken investors minimal due diligence to see massive profit potential in Ruger stock when Obama was first elected, said Ruger Chief Executive Mike Fifer. Shares hit a low of $4.50 the Friday after that Tuesday election; the stock was changing hands today at $61.61. Orders at every level of the distribution channel exploded the week of Obamas election, Fifer recalled. And continued to do so for months afterward. Americas leading ammunition maker, Vista Outdoor Inc (VSTO.N), has drawn investments from 319 funds in its first year of public trading and now has a market value of $2.9 billion. Its bonds are owned by a whos-who of U.S. investment and insurance companies. (For a graphic of top mutual fund investors in the leading gun and ammo stocks, see tmsnrt.rs/1TlCwBz )     Such investments can be hard to identify within large funds, even with concerted effort. Eric Milgram, a corporate research analyst whose two children were at Sandy Hook Elementary during the rampage, tried to purge his portfolio of firearms holdings. But he gave up after a frustrating search through mutual fund stock lists, holding companies and subsidiaries. Im disgusted with this industry; I dont want to be invested in it, said Milgram. But, he added, There are only so many hours in the day. Vanguard Group, the nations largest fund company, said it was unrealistic to balance political sensibilities with obligations to meet performance benchmarks. It would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to fulfill these obligations while managing portfolios that reflect the social concerns of all our clients, said Vanguard  spokeswoman Arianna Stefanoni Sherlock. Vanguard does, however, offer a Social Index fund  with about $2 billion in assets out of Vanguards total of about $3.4 trillion  that excludes firearms companies along with other stocks involved in an array of ethically sensitive industries. Smith & Wesson declined to comment for this story. Vista Outdoor did not respond to requests for comment. Obama and his tiny stake are typical of most Americans with holdings in firearms investments: They are invested in funds that buy shares of the relatively small part of the firearms industry that is publicly traded. But collectively, their investments are a boon to the gun industry and amount to a sizable stake in major gun and ammo makers.  For some gun safety advocates, the amounts are less important than the principle. Po Murray, who put four children through Sandy Hook Elementary, has also struggled to determine whether her investments include firearms companies. Its a real surprise: You find out you could be invested indirectly in Smith & Wesson, said Murray, who chairs the Newtown Action Alliance, a gun safety group. I dont want to be invested in gun companies. The $16 billion Illinois pension fund that includes Obamas investment holds at least $4.8 million in shares of gun industry stocks, including Smith & Wesson, Ruger, Vista and ammunition maker Olin Corp (OLN.N).  Until 2014, the pension fund owned about $1.5 million of the debt of Remington Outdoors, another gun manufacturer. Remington did not respond to requests for comment.  The Illinois pension plan also invests in at least one mutual fund with gun industry exposure. The $1.1 billion Templeton Global Smaller Companies Fund owned $9.5 million of Smith & Wesson stock at the end of December, fund disclosures show. Obama and other plan participants have no say in how the money is invested. Thats controlled by the Illinois State Board of Investment, which said it has no policy on investing in firearm and ammo companies.  (For a graphic showing firearms investments by Obamas Illinois pension fund, see: tmsnrt.rs/1TlCRV0 ) In its analysis, Reuters used mutual fund holdings data from Morningstar and Lipper Inc, a Thomson Reuters company, to examine firearms investments during the Obama presidency.  The list of funds holding such stocks includes some of the biggest and most prominent, such as Vanguard and the second-largest fund group, Fidelity Investments. It extends to BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), and Dimensional Fund Advisors. The analysis is based on disclosures made by individual funds. Some of the gun stockholders are passively managed index funds. But many are actively managed, such as Fidelitys $40 billion Low-Priced Stock Fund (FLPSX.O), which has become Smith & Wessons second-largest mutual fund investor under storied stock-picker Joel Tillinghast. The fund held about 1.1 million shares worth $20 million as of Oct. 31, according to fund disclosures. Fidelity and Dimensional declined to comment. BlackRock - the worlds largest asset manager with $4.6 trillion under management - manages $200 billion of that total in investment options that screen out certain stocks, including companies involved in  firearms, tobacco and alcohol businesses, spokesman Peter McKillop said. Obama isnt the only gun-regulation advocate with gun-industry holdings. Former congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy - elected after her husband was killed in the 1993 Long Island Rail Road shooting - pushed relentlessly for gun safety legislation. While in office, she held shares worth between $3,003 and $45,000 in at least three exchange-traded funds with stakes in gun and ammo companies, according to her last financial disclosure before retiring last year. She also invested between $2,002 and $30,000 for two grandchildren in so-called 529 college-savings plans that include a Vanguard fund holding firearms stocks, disclosures show. The New York Democrat could not be reached for comment. As a federal retirement benefit, members of the U.S. Congress can participate in a Thrift Savings Plan, which offers an investment option - the S Fund - that holds stock in firearms companies. Financial disclosures show that S Fund investors include Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Senate Democrat and a leading advocate for stricter background checks for gun buyers. Durbin disclosed an S Fund investment of about $115,000.  Durbins office declined to comment. Some members of Congress welcome the investment option. Im just grateful the fund managers are investing in something thats making money, said Representative Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican who opposes gun restrictions and has a small investment in the S fund. For all the debate, Obama has made no progress in passing tougher gun laws. Measures such as universal background checks have withered in Congress, where the number of anti-gun control Republicans has grown.  Calls for tighter controls have been met with bursts of gun sales, according to U.S. background-check data on gun purchasers. Gun store owners attribute the extra sales to consumers who fear the president will make it harder to buy arms. Lets just say hes been good for business, Jack Lesher, manager of Chucks Firearms in Atlanta, said of Obama. Gun sales jumped again recently after the president blasted congressional inaction on gun control and vowed to use executive powers to expand background checks for buyers and bolster licensing requirements for dealers. His announcement followed yet another mass shooting, on Dec. 2 in San Bernardino, California, where a couple pledging allegiance to Islamic State killed 14 people.  For the week that ended Dec. 20, firearms background checks - a proxy for guns sales - totaled 839,109, the second-highest week since 1998. Only the week after the Sandy Hook shootings was higher, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Vistas main factories have churned out bullets 24 hours, seven days a week for at least two years, Vista Chief Financial Officer Stephen Nolan told investors in November.  Now the industry is ready for an election-year surge.  The politics of gun control could stay in the headlines, which we believe could lead to a record year, wrote Chris Krueger, senior research analyst at Lake Street Capital Markets, in a note to investors in January. Ruger is boosting inventories to prepare, after learning a costly lesson going into the last presidential election. Demand peaked that year, based on the number of FBI background checks sought for new gun purchases. The surge followed Obamas re-election and the Sandy Hook shooting. When we went into late 2011, we got cleaned out of inventory  even though we increased production dramatically, company CEO Fifer told investors during a November conference call.  The company, he said, probably left money on the table. ",politicsNews,"February 5, 2016 ",1
"Trading algorithm shows how mass shootings, politics boost gun shares","(Reuters) - A stock-trading algorithm built for Reuters highlights the correlations among gun purchases, mass shootings and the politics of gun regulation. With the benefit of hindsight, the Boston-based hedge fund Quantopian examined how a theoretical investor would have fared by investing equal amounts in Smith & Wesson Holding Corp SWHC.O and Sturm Ruger & Co (RGR.N) after 20 events that impacted the companies sales or stock prices. The events, chosen by Reuters, included 12 mass shootings, starting with the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting; six events involving President Barack Obama, includingtwo elections and various calls for gun regulation; and two U.S. Supreme Court decisions favorable to gun companies.     Hedge funds and other sophisticated investors use computer-driven algorithms to place trades based on a defined set of instructions.  In the theoretical exercise for Reuters, the Quantopian algorithm showed that buying the two gun stocks the first trading day after the events and selling them 90 days later would have produced a return of 365 percent over a nine-year period  compared to 66 percent for the S&P 500 Index. A buy-and-hold bet on Smith & Wesson stock starting in January 2007 would have produced a return of 137 percent.

Colombian leader says received assurances of support from Republican U.S. lawmakers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said on Friday that Republican members of the U.S. Congress had indicated their continuing support for Colombias effort to achieve peace with leftist rebels and recover from years of civil war. His comments, at the State Department, came a day after President Barack Obama said he planned to ask Congress for more than $450 million in aid to help Colombia implement a peace accord to end Latin Americas longest war. Asked whether Republicans had backed the administration plan, Santos told reporters at the State Department he did not hear one single voice doubting the success of the current U.S. aid effort, Plan Colombia, and he had received expressions of continuing support. He said he did not receive any formal commitments but hoped Congress would support the new proposal. ",politicsNews,"February 5, 2016 ",1
Trump says will attend March Fox debate with Megyn Kelly: report,"(Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Friday he will attend a Fox News televised debate on March 3 with moderator Megyn Kelly after he skipped a similar event hosted by Fox last week, an online and cable television network reported on Friday.  No, Ill be there. I have no objection to being there. That had nothing to do with Megyn Kelly the fact that I went out of the last one, it had to do with a memo that was sent out by Fox that was a little bit taunting and I said it was inappropriate, Trump said on NewsmaxTV.com.  He added that he had no regrets about missing the Jan. 28 debate in Des Moines, Iowa just days before the Iowa caucuses, the first nominating contest of the 2016 campaign, at which he came in second after Texas Senator Ted Cruz.      And what happened, because I didnt do it I raised $6 million for the vets. So, I wouldnt have changed places. I did the right thing, he said on The Steve Malzberg Show. Trump said last week he was angered by a statement from Fox News (FOXA.O) that mocked him for refusing to participate in the  Des Moines event. The real estate billionaire had said earlier he doubted he would be treated fairly at the Des Moines debate and at one point called Kelly a lightweight reporter and highly overrated. He later said Fox News had apologized for the statement and that the situation had been resolved. Trump accused Kelly last August of asking him tougher questions than other candidates during a debate. His comments drew outcry, with some accusing the business tycoon of sexism.

Michigan governor: solve Flint water crisis instead of laying blame,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Michigan Governor Rick Snyder said on Friday he wants officials to focus on solving problems around lead-contaminated drinking water in the city of Flint instead of laying blame as he said some have been doing. There are a number of folk out there that are spending their time mainly on the political side and the blame side, he said at a meeting in Flint of local and state officials responding to the crisis. Snyders comments came a day after liberal group Progress Michigan released emails showing high-ranking state officials knew about an increase in Legionnaires disease in Genesee County, where Flint is located, and a possible link to the contaminated water almost a year before the governor said he got information about the outbreak. Snyder, who has repeatedly apologized for the states poor handling of the crisis, previously said he did not learn of the rise in Legionnaires cases until last month.     The governor and state officials have been criticized for not catching the contaminated water sooner, with some calling for Snyder to resign.  Later on Friday, Snyders office said the former head of the state Department of Environmental Qualitys Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance unit, Liane Shekter Smith, was fired. She and a second employee were suspended last month, and a state spokesman cited a civil service rule allowing for termination due to failure to do ones job.  A second DEQ employee, environmental manager Stephen Busch, remains on suspension and no decision has been made on his status, state officials said. Flint, near Detroit, was under the control of a state-appointed emergency manager when it switched the source of its tap water from Detroits system to the Flint River in April 2014 to save money. It switched back last October after tests found high levels of lead in samples of childrens blood. The more corrosive water from the river leached more lead from the city pipes than Detroit water did. Lead can damage the nervous system. On Friday, lawmakers on a U.S. House of Representatives panel said they plan to hold a hearing next month to address Flint health and infrastructure issues. The energy and commerce panel did not have details on the date or who would testify. This week, Congress held its first hearing into the Flint crisis. The House Oversight Committee did not invite Snyder, a Republican, to testify, something Democrats on the panel complained bitterly about. ",politicsNews,"February 5, 2016 ",1

Obama claims victory after drop in U.S. jobless rate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said Americans should feel good about the economy after the latest jobs report on Friday showed the U.S. unemployment rate at an eight-year low of 4.9 percent. Obama, in his eighth and final year in office, made a relatively rare and unexpected appearance in the White House briefing room to talk about how the economy had recovered under his watch. We have recovered from the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, the worst in my lifetime and the lifetime of most of the people in this room, Obama said, noting the unemployment rate was 10 percent in 2009, when he took office. Weve done it faster, stronger, better, more durably than just about any other advanced economy, Obama said. The White House has griped that Obama does not get enough credit for turning the economy around, a complaint Obama joked about on Thursday during a visit from the Golden State Warriors basketball champions. You defied the cynics, you accomplished big things, you racked up a great record, and you dont get enough credit - I cant imagine how that feels, Obama said, drawing laughter. On Friday, he acknowledged that theres still anxiety and concern about the general direction of the economy, noting the job losses, stock market plunges and free fall in the housing market in 2007-2008 were still fresh in Americans memories. Obama said softness in China, Europe and other economies presented challenges to U.S. exporters and he said it was important for the United States to keep our foot to the accelerator to further strengthen the economy. We should feel good about the progress weve made, understanding that we have still got more work to do, he said, noting the budget he will propose to Congress on Tuesday will have ideas for job creation and retraining. Obama slammed Republican candidates in the race to replace him in the Nov. 8 presidential election for talking down the economy.

Obama claims victory after drop in U.S. jobless rate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said Americans should feel good about the economy after the latest jobs report on Friday showed the U.S. unemployment rate at an eight-year low of 4.9 percent. Obama, in his eighth and final year in office, made a relatively rare and unexpected appearance in the White House briefing room to talk about how the economy had recovered under his watch. We have recovered from the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, the worst in my lifetime and the lifetime of most of the people in this room, Obama said, noting the unemployment rate was 10 percent in 2009, when he took office. Weve done it faster, stronger, better, more durably than just about any other advanced economy, Obama said. The White House has griped that Obama does not get enough credit for turning the economy around, a complaint Obama joked about on Thursday during a visit from the Golden State Warriors basketball champions. You defied the cynics, you accomplished big things, you racked up a great record, and you dont get enough credit - I cant imagine how that feels, Obama said, drawing laughter. On Friday, he acknowledged that theres still anxiety and concern about the general direction of the economy, noting the job losses, stock market plunges and free fall in the housing market in 2007-2008 were still fresh in Americans memories. Obama said softness in China, Europe and other economies presented challenges to U.S. exporters and he said it was important for the United States to keep our foot to the accelerator to further strengthen the economy. We should feel good about the progress weve made, understanding that we have still got more work to do, he said, noting the budget he will propose to Congress on Tuesday will have ideas for job creation and retraining. Obama slammed Republican candidates in the race to replace him in the Nov. 8 presidential election for talking down the economy. I know thats still inconvenient for Republican stump speeches as their doom-and-despair tour plays in New Hampshire, Obama said, referring to the primary election in the state on Tuesday.

"In contentious debate, Clinton and Sanders both claim 'progressive' mantle ","DURHAM, N.H. (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton went on the attack against rival Bernie Sanders on Thursday in their most contentious presidential debate yet, questioning whether his ambitious proposals were viable and accusing him of an artful smear in suggesting she could be bought by political donations. Sanders fought back repeatedly, questioning Clintons progressive credentials and portraying her as a creature of the political establishment in a debate that featured heated exchanges on healthcare, college tuition funding and efforts to rein in Wall Street. The intensity reflected a race that has seen Clintons once prohibitive lead in polls shrivel against Sanders as the two vie for the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 election. One of Clintons most forceful remarks came in response to a suggestion by Sanders that she could be influenced by political donations by Wall Street.  Enough is enough. If youve got something to say, say it directly, she said. But you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received. So I think its time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out, she said. Clinton charged that Sanders proposal for single-payer universal healthcare coverage would jeopardize Obamacare, calling it a great mistake, and said his plans for free college education would be too costly to be realistic. I can get things done. Im not making promises I cant keep, Clinton said. Sanders said he would not dismantle Obamacare but would expand it, pointing to the many other countries that provide universal healthcare. I do not accept the belief that the United States of America cant do that, Sanders said. By moving forward, rallying the American people, I do believe we should have healthcare for all. Sanders said his proposal for free tuition at public universities would be paid with a tax on Wall Street speculation. The middle class bailed out Wall Street in their time of need. Now, it is Wall Streets time to help the middle class, he said. Five days before New Hampshire holds the second of the state-by-state presidential nominating contests, opinion polls show Sanders, a U.S. senator from neighboring Vermont, with a double-digit lead over Clinton after surprising the front-runner by finishing just barely behind her in Iowa on Monday. Clinton seemed energized by her underdog status in New Hampshire, delivering her most aggressive debate performance of the campaign. It was reminiscent of her 2008 run against Barack Obama, when she also began as the front-runner but became a sharper and less cautious candidate as she began to lose. The debate was the first since former Maryland Governor Martin OMalley dropped out on Monday after a poor finish in Iowa, giving the two candidates more freedom to directly engage each other. Sanders accused Clinton of representing the establishment, while saying he represented ordinary working Americans. He also noted her Super PAC had taken contributions from Wall Street firms and that Clinton received big speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. Clinton disputed the establishment label, saying it was quite amusing to accuse a woman, running to be the first woman president, as the establishment. The two battled over who best represented progressive ideals. Sanders said he would lead a political revolution, but Clinton questioned his ability to get his proposals through a Republican-led Congress. A progressive is someone who makes progress, she said. And she attacked Sanders own credentials as a progressive, bringing up his votes against the 1993 Brady bill that mandated federal background checks on gun purchases and his 2005 vote for a bill to protect gun manufacturers and dealers from lawsuits. If were going to get into labels, I dont think it was particularly progressive to vote against the Brady bill five times, she said. I dont think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity.  Sanders repeated his earlier pledge not to attack Clinton on the controversy over her use of a private email account and a private server for government business when she was secretary of state. I will not politicize it, he said. But Sanders renewed his attacks on Clinton for her Senate vote to authorize the U.S. invasion of Iraq, which she has since called a mistake. He pointed out he voted against the war, which he said had led to the rise of the Islamic State militant group. Look we did differ, Clinton responded. A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS. We have to look at the threats that we face right now. Clinton has tried to play down expectations for her performance in New Hampshire, where she came from behind for an upset victory in the 2008 campaign just days after losing badly to Obama in Iowa. The surprisingly strong performance by Sanders in Iowa is likely to prolong a race that Clinton entered as the presumptive front-runner. In addition to previously scheduled debates in Wisconsin and Florida, the candidates added one in March in Flint, Michigan, to draw attention to the citys contaminated water crisis ahead of the Michigan primary. They also will debate in April and May.

White House says doesn't expect Congress to pass every budget item,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday it expects to have to compromise on elements of the federal budget President Barack Obama will submit to U.S. lawmakers next week. Our expectation is not that Congress is just going to pass every single line item thats included in our budget, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. Because Congress is controlled by Republicans with different priorities, there will be debate and were ultimately going to have a compromise, Earnest said. ",politicsNews,"February 5, 2016 ",1
Obama's move on gender pay gap seen as first step in uphill battle,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Advocates fighting to close the U.S. gender pay gap hailed President Barack Obamas proposal to expand salary reporting requirements but said much more was needed to end wage discrimination.  Under the plan, companies with 100 employees or more must provide data on hours worked and salary ranges, broken down by gender, race and ethnicity, to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission each year to help identify and combat pay discrimination.    Lisa Maatz, vice president of government relations at the American Association of University Women, said the data would be useful in passing legislation, making companies comply with existing laws and proving the gender pay gap is not a myth. The wage gap is a persistent, pernicious problem, and it has been around for awhile, Maatz said in an interview. We still have a lot to do to change it, but this is an excellent step forward.  Maatz said other measures, including non-retaliation policies at companies so women can ask about discrepancies in pay and changes in how salaries are determined, would accelerate progress. Not using salary histories but rather looking at resumes and taking into account experience and paying for what the job is worth to the company will do a lot to help close the gender pay gap, Maatz added.  Women earn 79 cents for every dollar a man makes for equal work, according to the Institute for Womens Policy Research. Although the pay gap has narrowed since 1960, when women made about 60 cents for every dollar, the institute calculates that if change continues at the same pace, women will not reach equal pay until 2059. The current situation is worse for black women, at 60 cents, and Latina women, at 55 cents, said Vivien Labaton, co-founder of the non-profit Make It Work campaign for economic security for working families.  Labaton said making salary range data that companies submit to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission accessible to their employees would speed up change. What Make It Work is calling for is a publicly available database that would show what employers pay for different jobs based on sex, race and ethnicity, she said. The commission issues only aggregated data that does not reveal any particular employers or employees information. We do know that the more transparency you have, the smaller the gender pay gap there will be, said Maatz. ",politicsNews,"February 5, 2016 ",1
Rubio under attack as New Hampshire primary race heats up,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie has dismissed him as a puppet and former mentor Jeb Bush called him not fit to serve as up-and-coming Republican Marco Rubio becomes the man to beat in next weeks New Hampshire primary. Rubios unexpectedly strong third-place showing in Mondays Iowa caucuses has made him the target of rival Republican candidates who focused their campaigns on the New England states first-in-the-nation primary. Christie, the New Jersey governor, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Ohio Governor John Kasich all hope for a strong showing in New Hampshire to boost their flagging campaigns to become the Republican nominee in the Nov. 8 election to replace Democratic President Barack Obama. While Christie said on Thursday he would not be out of the race if he lost to Rubio in New Hampshire, Kasich has told audiences he would go back to Ohio if he got smoked there. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, who won the Iowa caucuses on strong evangelical Christian credentials, was expected to have less appeal for voters in New Hampshire. Real estate mogul Donald Trumps second-place showing in Iowa raised questions about how well his popularity can survive the voting booth. Christie has been one of Rubios fiercest critics this week, calling the first-term U.S. senator from Florida the boy in the bubble the day after the Iowa vote. He continued the personal vein of attack on Thursday. This isnt the most controlled candidate weve seen in this race at all. His handlers handle him all the time, Christie said on Fox News. We need to take him out of that controlled atmosphere because, believe me, it wont be controlled against Hillary Clinton this fall, he said. Clinton, the former secretary of state, is battling U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the Democratic nomination.  Bush, whose establishment Republican credentials have not guaranteed him public support, has also turned on his former protege. On Wednesday he took out a full-page ad in a leading New Hampshire newspaper, the Union-Leader, attacking Rubio as not ready to serve as commander in chief. Nearly every political leader in Florida of stature who knows Marco and Jebs records have joined us in endorsing Governor Bush, the ad read.  Rubio has garnered significant endorsements since Monday, including U.S. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, which holds its primary this month, and U.S. Representative Matt Salmon of Arizona, a co-founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.

Donors to White House hopeful Jeb Bush urged not to switch to Rubio,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donors say Republican Jeb Bushs U.S. presidential campaign has not given them a green light to switch to rival establishment candidate Marco Rubio, whose strong third-place finish in this weeks Iowa caucuses outshone the sixth-place Bush.   A former Florida governor, Bush, 62, is hoping for a better result in New Hampshire, the state which on Tuesday will hold the countrys second nominating contest for the Nov. 8 election to succeed President Barack Obama. U.S. Senator Rubio, 44, also of Florida, emerged as the leading moderate, establishment Republican candidate in Iowa, behind U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, 45, and billionaire businessman Donald Trump, 69.  Senior campaign officials for Bush have been seeking to reassure donors that the one-time front-runner has a path forward after his dismal Iowa showing, three Bush donors told Reuters. They said senior aides to Bush held conference calls for donors on Tuesday to reassure them, offering an upbeat message about Bushs finances and ground game in New Hampshire and a determination to press on.   Rubio began the year with more than $10 million in cash on hand, his campaign reported on Sunday. Bush reported cash on hand as of Sunday of $7.6 million. Bush, campaigning later this week in New Hampshire with his mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, has benefited from the intense loyalty donors have shown his father and brother, former presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. The donors said there was no indication Bush would shy away from contrasting himself with either Rubio or Cruz.   People who are for Jeb are for Jeb, one donor said. On the campaign trail this week Bush has questioned the abilities of freshman U.S. senators - both Rubio and Cruz are first-term senators - by saying they lacked his proven record.

Obama pledges more than $450 million aid to help Colombia peace plan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Thursday he would ask the U.S. Congress for more than $450 million in aid to help Colombia end half a century of wrenching conflict and implement a peace accord aimed at ending Latin Americas longest war. If approved, the aid would help with security and fighting the drug trade, as well as educating and retraining members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the leftist rebel group at war with the government since 1964. After half a century of wrenching conflict, the time has come for peace, Obama said after meeting with Colombian President Juan Manual Santos. The U.S. government would also commit $33 million to a global program to help the country remove land mines in the next five years, and Obama said he would help mobilize more international aid if the peace deal is reached. Three previous attempts at an accord failed, but the government and FARC are on the verge of an agreement after four years of talks. Santos thanked the U.S. government for its long-standing bipartisan support for Plan Colombia, $10 billion in funding between 2000 and 2015 for military and social programs that he said helped keep Colombia from becoming a failed state. The new program, dubbed Peace Colombia, would provide about 25 percent more U.S. funding compared with 2016 levels. Just as the United States has been Colombias partner in a time of war, I indicated to President Santos we will be your partner in waging peace, Obama said at a White House reception. A jump in U.S. aid is fundamental to the success of the peace plan, particularly given a 20 percent hit to Colombias budget from the plunge in oil prices, said Douglass Cassel of the University of Notre Dame, who has been an adviser to Santos for the past year. The government of Colombia will do everything it can, but its clear that it doesnt have sufficient resources on its own to do the job the way it ought to be done without significant support from the United States and the European Union, Cassel said in an interview.

What will be in Obama's final budget proposal?,"(Reuters) - President Barack Obama is set on Tuesday to unveil his budget proposal for fiscal year 2017, his final year in office.  But since the Republican-controlled Congress controls the purse strings, much of Obamas budget will likely stay on the drawing board. The following are some of the proposals that will be included: The Pentagon will ask for more than $7 billion for the fight against Islamic State, up about 35 percent from the previous years budget request to Congress, and wants a fourfold increase for military training and exercises in Europe to support NATO allies. In a long-shot bid to raise $20 billion to expand transit systems and research self-driving cars, Obama will propose a $10-a-barrel tax on crude oil.  The budget will propose a 1.6 percent pay increase for military and civilian federal personnel. Obama will ask for $1.1 billion in new funding to expand treatment for people addicted to heroin and prescription pain killers, a growing epidemic. Obama pledged more than $450 million in aid to Colombia to help with security and integrating rebel combatants into society under a pending peace deal to end Latin Americas longest war. Obama wants to expand the earned income tax credit, or EITC, to low-income workers without children. Other proposals include $12 billion over 10 years to supplement food stamps for poor families when school meal programs are closed in the summer, $2 billion in emergency aid for families in crisis, a combined $328 million in education and housing grants to poor neighborhoods, and a $15 million pilot program to help poor families move to better neighborhoods. The budget will include three years of federal funding to 19 state governments that passed up an earlier offer to expand Medicaid coverage for more than 4 million low-income people. Obama will ask for tweaks to a tax on certain health insurance plans that is unpopular with labor unions. The White House will ask for $5.5 billion in incentives for businesses that hire young people and $200 million for apprenticeship programs. Obama will ask for $4 billion for states and $100 million for school districts to expand computer science in schools. The budget will include $1 billion over five years to help coal-mining regions with economic development. The White House will ask for $755 million for Vice President Joe Bidens moonshot effort to find new cancer treatments. The budget will include $700 million in agricultural research grants, double the spending level in 2016. Obama has proposed $500 million to boost access to mental healthcare as part of his push to address gun violence. Obama will propose $95 million for a new office responsible for background checks for federal employees. As part of reforms to the criminal justice system, Obama will ask for $24 million for better housing for inmates with serious mental illnesses. Obama will propose tax credits for small businesses offering 401(k) plans or expanding access to retirement savings programs. Obama will seek to expand unemployment insurance to more types of workers, provide wage insurance for workers moving to lower-paid positions, and provide incentives to states for retraining or relocating workers. Obama will ask for funding to hire 200 new ATF staff to enforce gun laws. ",politicsNews,"February 4, 2016 ",1
"NYC mayor proposes retirement plan, light-rail system in speech","NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Mayor Bill de Blasio proposed a retirement plan for private-sector workers and a new light rail system in his State of the City speech on Thursday, while indicating that social inequality was decreasing under his administration. The Democratic mayor of the United States biggest city has been in office for a little over two years. He came to power promising to narrow the inequality gap that he said had created a tale of two cities after three four-year terms of his predecessor, Michael Bloomberg. De Blasio pressed that message again in his keynote speech on Thursday: We see the Tale of Two Cities transforming into One New York, he said during the speech at a performing arts center in the Bronx. New York has a glamorous reputation but is home to many poor neighborhoods. Rising real estate prices have made the city less affordable for many residents. A plan to build a $2.5 billion light rail system linking Brooklyn and Queens, leaked to the news media a day earlier, was the boldest element in the speech for a mayor who has tended to favor social policy over infrastructure. The 16-mile (26-km) track would run from the borough of Queens Astoria neighborhood, tracing a line along the East River and New Yorks Upper Harbor, to link up with Brooklyns Sunset Park section. It would pass through popular Brooklyn neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Brooklyn Heights. The mayor also called for the city to develop a retirement system for private-sector employees, addressing the low rate of retirement savings, especially among low-income workers. We absolutely do not accept a status quo where people work all their lives only to be left with nothing, said De Blasio, echoing previous calls for a better deal for workers. He also outlined plans to develop Governors Island, an underutilized area of land in the Upper Harbor off the southern tip of Manhattan that had been used as a military base until the city acquired it in 2010. De Blasio highlighted his push for a $15 dollar minimum wage, a movement that has gained traction with Democrats nationally, and called for his initiatives to introduce paid parental and sick leave to be adopted nationally. De Blasio shifted the speech to 7 p.m. (0000 GMT) from its usual daytime spot in the hope of reaching more New Yorkers. ",politicsNews,"February 5, 2016 ",1
Texas prosecutor offers probation to anti-abortion activist behind video,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - An anti-abortion activist indicted for using a fake drivers license ID to aid secret filming inside Planned Parenthood facilities turned himself into authorities in Houston on Thursday and was offered a probation deal, prosecutors said. David Daleiden, indicted in January by a Houston-area grand jury, appeared at Harris County District Court on a charge of tampering with a governmental record, which can bring up to 20 years in prison. He also faces a misdemeanor charge for trying to procure fetal tissue. Daleiden leads the California-based Center for Medical Progress that released the secretly filmed videos used to accuse the womens health group of trading in aborted fetal tissue.  He was offered a probation deal in which, if he keeps a clean record for a certain period of time, charges would be dropped, prosecutors said.   Daleidens lawyers said he planned to reject the deal and is seeking an apology from prosecutors. Daleiden told a news conference outside court that he wants Texas to prosecute Planned Parenthood, saying it is open for business in baby body parts.  Planned Parenthood has denied Daleidens allegations and sued in federal court, arguing the people who recorded the videos acted illegally. In a twist for the Texas Republican leaders who had ordered an investigation, the grand jury in January cleared Planned Parenthood of wrongdoing and indicted video makers Daleiden and Sandra Merritt. Were glad theyre being held accountable, and we hope other law enforcement agencies pursue criminal charges, as well, said Eric Ferrero, vice president at Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Merritt, a lesser figure in the filming, appeared at a Houston court on Wednesday and was also offered a probation deal. Lawyers for the activist do not dispute that the pair used false IDs but said they did so for investigative journalism. Countering that contention, Eric Ferrero, vice president at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said, We dont know of any journalists who have engaged in wire fraud and mail fraud, lied to multiple government agencies, tampered with government documents, and broken laws in at least four states only to lie about what they found. Its hard to imagine anyone calling that journalism.  The videos released last summer purported to show Planned Parenthood officials trying to negotiate prices for aborted fetal tissue. Under federal law, donated human fetal tissue may be used for research, but profiting from its sale is prohibited. In response to the videos, Texas and other Republican-controlled states tried to halt funding for Planned Parenthood. U.S. congressional Republicans pushed for a funding cut. Planned Parenthood has said Daleiden and Merritt presented fake IDs in April 2015 and posed as research executives from a fictitious company to secretly film conversations at a health and administrative center in Houston.

"Rice aides, Powell got classified info on personal email accounts","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell and aides to his successor, Condoleezza Rice, both received classified information a handful of times via personal email accounts, the top Democrat on a congressional oversight panel said on Thursday. The findings come after nearly a year of controversy over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintons decision to set up a private email server for her work as secretary of state. Democratic lawmakers and staff on Clintons presidential campaign seized on the report as vindicating some of their defenses of the controversial arrangement. Representative Elijah Cummings said the disclosures about Powells and Rices aides emails were made by the State Departments inspector general, who is reviewing the email practices of the last five secretaries of state. That office told the State Department on Wednesday that it found 12 emails containing classified information sent to Rices aides or Powell, according to Cummings, who is the ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives Oversight Committee. In a statement, Powell said the two emails he received were not judged to contain confidential information at the time they were sent to him by American ambassadors. I wish they would release them, Powell told NBC News, so that a normal, air-breathing mammal would look at them and say, Whats the issue? A representative for Rice, who, as with Powell, served under Republican President George W. Bush, said the 10 emails sent to her aides did not contain intelligence information.  More than 1,500 of Clintons emails, which are being made public on a federal judges order, have been found to include classified information so far, according to the State Department. Clinton both sent and received information the State Department now deems to be classified, including the privately shared thoughts of foreign leaders, as well as highly classified U.S. intelligence agency secrets. It became public last March that Clinton set up a private email server in her New York home for her work as President Barack Obamas secretary of state between 2009 and 2013. Accusations that she exposed government secrets to hackers and tried to side-step record keeping laws have since dogged her campaign, and the arrangement is being examined by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Clintons campaign staff suggested the findings announced on Thursday helped vindicate her claim that she did nothing wrong or unusual and repeated their accusation that the State Department is overclassifying her emails, an idea the department has dismissed. Hillary Clinton agrees with her predecessor that his emails, like hers, are being inappropriately subjected to over-classification, John Podesta, Clintons campaign chairman, said in a statement, calling for their unredacted release. J. William Leonard, who oversaw the governments classification regime as the Information Security Oversight Office director until 2008, said so-called spillage of classified information into unsecured email systems was common. Thats why from the get-go it was exceedingly poor judgment to set up a private email account because of this very real fact, Leonard said in an interview, referring to Clintons arrangement. The government forbids sending classified information via email, but the .gov email system, which Clinton circumvented, is monitored and protected on the assumption that classified information spills into it. Powell has said the State Department was technologically backward when he joined in 2001 and that he had to fight to get an Internet-connected computer installed in his office, from which he continued to use his personal email account. Georgia Godfrey, Rices chief of staff at Stanford Universitys Hoover Institution, said Rice did not use email while at the State Department, and that the 10 emails to her staff were reports on diplomatic conversations. Government regulations require that information shared in confidence by foreign government officials should be treated as classified. ",politicsNews,"February 4, 2016 ",1
"Obama says faith a cure for fears stirred by war, hard times","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama, taking on Republican presidential candidates for stirring up anxiety among Americans, told leaders at Washingtons national prayer breakfast on Thursday that faith could conquer fear brought on by war, technology, and economic troubles. It is a primal emotion, fear, one that we all experience. And it can be contagious, spreading through societies, and through nations, Obama said. For me, and I know for so many of you, faith is the great cure for fear.Jesus is a good cure for fear.God gives believers the power, the love, the sound mind required to conquer any fear.And what more important moment for that faith than right now? he said. Obamas remarks came a day after his first visit to a U.S. mosque, where he sought to allay fears of Americans accustomed to pop-culture portrayals of Muslims as terrorists and to reassure Muslim American youth about their identity. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States.  Obama, a Christian, said his faith had helped him deal with the challenges of being president and was bolstering him as his children grew up and prepared for adulthood. It helps me deal with the common, everyday fears that we all share.The main one Im feeling right now is that our children grow up too fast.Theyre leaving! he said to laughter. The president said he had drawn on his faith when comforting the parents of children killed by gun violence, a subtle reference to his failed effort to sharpen U.S. gun control laws. He said that people of faith had helped take in Syrian refugees, a subtle jab at Republicans who oppose allowing them into the country. ",politicsNews,"February 4, 2016 ",1
Democrats block U.S. energy bill in fight over Flint aid,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Democrats teamed up with some of their Republican counterparts on Thursday and blocked a wide-ranging U.S. energy bill in a fight over aid to Flint, Michigan, to help rectify its drinking water crisis.  The Republican-led Senate failed in two procedural votes to advance the bill after behind-the-scenes bipartisan talks broke down. Negotiators hope to find a compromise on an amendment that would have allocated millions of dollars to replace Flints contaminated water system and provide healthcare for people sickened by it. The legislation fell far short of the 60 votes needed to clear procedural roadblocks and bring it to a vote. Democrats are making support for Flint, a poor city of mostly African Americans and Latinos near Detroit, a wider issue ahead of the November presidential election. Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are due to hold a March presidential debate in Flint.    Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska and a co-sponsor of the bill, proposed making up to $550 million available to Flint. Only $50 million would be immediately available to the city, where thousands of children have ingested lead from polluted water, and the water is still dangerous. Its not about the money, its about how quickly it could get to the state and the form of it. What we need is dollars up front, Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan told reporters after the vote. Financially strapped Flint changed its water supply in 2014 from Detroits system to the Flint River. Corrosive water from the river that runs past dumping grounds caused lead to leach from aging pipes in Flint, a city of 100,000. Lead is a toxin that can harm the brains of children and cause other health problems. Stabenow and Michigan Senator Gary Peters had proposed an amendment to the bill to direct up to $600 million to Flint.  The energy bill would have taken steps to speed permitting of liquefied natural gas facilities, fund research into advanced nuclear reactors and protect the power grid from cyber attacks. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the Senates No. 2 Republican, said Democrats were trying to embarrass Republicans by making it look like they did not want to help Flint.   Stabenow noted that when a fertilizer plant exploded in West, Texas, in 2013, Cornyn pressed the federal government to direct millions of dollars to deal with the crisis.  Republican Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma had proposed a deal in which money for Flint would come from a fund for advanced vehicles. Democrats said such a deal would harm workers in the region, an automotive industry hub. ",politicsNews,"February 4, 2016 ",1
New York mayor to back $2.5 billion light rail in key speech,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio will back a $2.5 billion plan to create a light rail service linking the citys outer boroughs when he gives his annual keynote speech on Thursday The 16-mile track would run from Astoria in Queens, tracing a line along the East River and New Yorks upper harbor to link up with Sunset Park in Brooklyn. It would pass through popular neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Brooklyn Heights. The plan is not new but the mayors emphasis reflects the growing importance of the outer boroughs. It also makes good on his pledge to address the gap between wealthy Manhattan and the rest of the city, a longstanding gripe with many New Yorkers. This is about equity and innovation. We are mapping brand new transit that will knit neighborhoods together, de Blasio said in a statement. The introduction of a light rail service would be a new development for the city. It would mirror the increasing use of such services in New Jersey, especially connecting the growing commuter towns along the Hudson River, an area real estate developers have dubbed the Gold Coast. The mayors office said the city will offset costs with tax revenues from increased property values along the proposed line.  Major upgrades are being planned to aging transport infrastructure throughout the state. Governor Andrew Cuomo has embraced around $100 billion of projects including a $20 billion rail tunnel under the Hudson River. De Blasio, who comes from the liberal wing of the Democratic party, has emphasized social issues since taking office in 2014 such as free schooling for four year olds and reforming the citys police. He will likely use Thursdays state of the city address to hone in on some of those issues. Homelessness will likely be a focus after the mayor faced accusations he was not doing enough to address the problem.  De Blasio is also likely to revisit public safety. He and his police commissioner, Bill Bratton, cited new statistics on Wednesday showing this January was the safest ever.  De Blasio shifted Thursdays speech to 7 p.m. from its usual daytime spot in the hope of reaching more New Yorkers. It will be held at the Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, a concert venue in the Bronx.

Republican Senator Portman opposes TPP trade deal in present form,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Rob Portman on Thursday said he opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal in its present form, dealing a significant blow to the pact a day after officials from 12 countries signed it. Portman, from Ohio, said the Pacific trade deal fails to meet the needs of his states workers because it lacks an enforceable provision to fight currency manipulation and because of new, less-stringent country-of-origin rules for auto parts. I cannot support the TPP in its current form because it doesnt provide that level playing field, Portman said in a statement. While approval of the trade pact is a top priority of President Barack Obama this year, his final year in office, it faces stiff opposition from many of his fellow Democrats in Congress. Meanwhile, Republicans have begun voicing concerns with specific provisions and are indicating that they are in no rush to bring the deal to a vote. Besides insisting that portions of the sweeping pact be renegotiated, some Republicans worry that bringing TPP to a vote before the November elections could hurt the chances of some of their incumbents running in swing states or congressional districts. Portman is seeking a second term in an industrial state where many workers blame job losses on previous trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). He is expected to face a stiff challenge from former Democratic Governor Ted Strickland. The 12-nation deal would liberalize trade from Chile to Japan, representing 40 percent of the world economy.

"Mayor, city manager of Texas 'spinach capital' arrested for corruption","SAN ANTONIO (Reuters) - The mayor and city manager of a south Texas town that bills itself as the spinach capital of the world, were arrested on Thursday on charges including strong-arming contractors into paying bribes in exchange for doing business, authorities said. A federal indictment claims five current and former city officials of Crystal City demanded payments from contractors so they could pay off personal gambling bills, bar tabs, car loans, and other expenses. A businessman was also charged for running an illegal gambling operation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Texas Rangers padlocked the City Hall for Crystal City, with a population of about 7,500 people as part of a probe into corruption where city officials are also accused of dipping into city coffers for their own personal gain, law enforcement officials said. None of those arrested, who include Mayor Ricardo Lopez, made statements after being taken into custody. If convicted, each faces up to 10 years in a federal prison, prosecutors said. City Manager William Jonas, according to the indictment, was elevated to that position from city attorney to reward him for procuring bribes, the indictment said. Businessman Ngoc Tri Nguyen, known as Mister T, is charged with paying bribes in exchange for opening an illegal gambling room, and getting city officials to use their muscle to shut down a competing business, it said. Crystal City is known for a quirky tourist attraction of a large statue of the spinach-eating cartoon character Popeye in front of City Hall which celebrates the areas history as a spinach producer. It holds an annual spinach festival. Public corruption is one of the most insidious crimes confronting our communities today, FBI Special Agent in Charge Christopher Combs said in a statement. It contributes to the cynicism we are seeing from members of the public who often feel as though all politicians are corrupt. The arrests took place without incident and the FBI also seized documents at a San Antonio office in San Antonio, which is leased to Jonas, said FBI Special Agent Michelle Lee. Jonas, a San Antonio attorney, is a former prominent Texas Republican lobbyist who is also facing state charges of assault after police said he is suspected of pushing a woman who attempted to enter the City Hall using the wrong entrance.

Republican Carson cuts staff but vows to campaign on,"(Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said he intends to continue campaigning through the Republican National Convention in July after a report on Thursday said he planned a major downsizing of his flagging campaign. The Washington Post reported that Carson planned to eliminate 50 staff positions, or nearly one-half his staff. Carson, in an appearance on the Fox News Channel, said the cuts have been months in the making after an examination found inefficiencies in his campaign.       Its the same kind of thing I would do as president, the retired neurosurgeon said. There is a lot of money being wasted, a lot of inefficiency in government and just because you have the funds to continue that inefficiency doesnt mean that you should do it. The bulk of the cuts will come from his field offices and headquarters in Virginia, the Washington Post said, citing an internal memo and campaign officials. Carson will also reduce salaries for campaign workers, it said. Carson finished fourth among Republican presidential hopefuls in the Iowa caucuses on Monday with less than 10 percent of the vote.  The newspaper said other cost-saving measures included possibly using commercial flights instead of private planes and limiting Carsons travel team to a select few advisers. We will be able to continue the campaign right until Cleveland, Carson said, referring to the convention. But obviously you always make appropriate adjustments to make sure you can accomplish your goal. His most senior staffers will remain on the campaign team, according to the Post.

Pennsylvania governor to address budget amid bitter divide,"(Reuters) - Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf is expected to unveil his proposal for the states 2017 budget on Tuesday even though state lawmakers have yet to fully agree on the current spending plan that has languished half-baked as political acrimony has escalated. The state still has only a partial $23.4 billion emergency budget in place nearly a year after Wolf made his 2016 budget proposal the first time, for $29.9 billion. Wolf, a Democrat, had said he would support a negotiated budget of $30.8 billion, but state House Republican leaders scuttled it at the last minute in December. Its a gigantic cloud hanging over this years process, said Christopher Borick, associate political science professor at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, of the impasse and partial budget.     The incomplete deal, which Wolf called garbage and a ridiculous exercise in budget futility before stripping it down and signing it in December, was hammered out after school districts across the state threatened to close because of the lack of funding. One question now is whether Wolf will use that tone, or a more conciliatory one, during Tuesdays budget address. Wolf is committed to his agenda. I think he believes its the right thing to do, said G. Terry Madonna, public affairs professor at Pennsylvanias Franklin & Marshall College. Wolf took office in January 2015 pledging to restore education funding, to be paid for in part with a tax on natural gas extraction. He has already said his new budget will include $200 million of additional funding for K-12 public schools, on top of the $377 million increase proposed in the now-defunct compromise budget that Senate Republicans had supported. But while Wolf may view his clear win in 2014 over incumbent Republican Governor Tom Corbett as a mandate from voters, Republicans can point to how they increased their majorities in both houses of the state legislature in that election. Those results represented very mixed messages from the voters of the state, Borick said. That sowed the seeds very much for the type of gridlock we saw last year, where both sides felt empowered. The logjam makes fixes for the states now $2.3 billion structural budget deficit that much harder, Moodys Investors Service said in October when it threatened to lower its Aa3 rating on Pennsylvanias nearly $11 billion of outstanding general obligation debt.

"Republican Santorum drops out of White House race, endorses Rubio","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Rick Santorum withdrew from the race for the U.S. Republican presidential nomination on Wednesday and said he would endorse Senator Marco Rubio in the race for the White House. Santorum, a 57-year-old former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, won the Iowa caucuses four years ago but managed only 1 percent of the vote in the Iowa contest on Monday. Santorum, in an appearance on Fox News announcing his withdrawal and endorsement of Rubio, called the Florida senator a tremendously gifted young man and ... a born leader. He said Rubio can bring this country together, not just moderates and conservatives but young and old. Rubio, 44, finished third in Mondays Iowa caucuses, the first contest in the state-by-state battle to decide who will be the Republican nominee in the November presidential election. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas finished first in Iowa, putting a dent in real estate tycoon Donald Trumps standing as the Republican front-runner. Santorums withdrawal leaves nine Republican candidates in the 2016 White House race, with the next contest in New Hampshire on Tuesday. U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky announced earlier on Wednesday he was suspending his campaign after a fifth-place finish in Iowa.  A favorite of the Christian right, Santorum announced his White House bid in May with an eye on economic issues. He campaigned on a promise to boost the middle class,eliminate the Internal Revenue Service and crack down on illegalimmigration. Santorum won a reputation as a strong social conservative in Congress, where he opposed same-sex marriage and the teaching of evolution in schools.

Civil rights activist DeRay McKesson running for mayor of Baltimore,"(Reuters) - U.S. civil rights activist DeRay McKesson, who was instrumental in the growth of the Black Lives Matter movement against police violence, is running for mayor of Baltimore. McKesson, who filed his paperwork minutes before Wednesdays deadline, is among more than a dozen Democrats heading to an April primary.  The 30-year-old son of two now-recovered drug addicts, McKesson rose to prominence during the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police killing of unarmed black teen Michael Brown and has become one of the nations best-known civil rights leaders. His distinctive blue Patagonia vest has been seen everywhere from street demonstrations in his native Baltimore to a recent appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. I am not the silver bullet for the challenges of our city - no one individual is, McKesson said on Wednesday in a post on the blog publishing platform Medium.  Together, with the right ideas, the right passion, the right people, we can take this city in a new direction. His rivals include former Baltimore Mayor Sheila Dixon and state Senator Catherine Pugh. The city has not elected a Republican mayor in more than 50 years. Current Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said in September that she would not seek re-election when her term ends. A website set up to collect contributions for McKessons campaign had recorded 474 donations totaling $34,383 by midday Thursday. An alumnus of Maines Bowdoin College, McKesson worked in Baltimore and Minneapolis schools before moving into full-time activism.  One political observer said working-class Baltimore voters might hold his lack of political experience against him. The profile he has now, hes gotten from doing national work, not local work, said Lester Spence, associate professor of political science and African studies at Johns Hopkins University. Last year, the mainly black city of 600,000 people was torn by its worst riots in a half-century following the death of Freddie Gray from injuries sustained while in police custody.    Coming amid a string of controversial police killings across the United States, Grays death proved a turning point when prosecutors brought charges against six officers within weeks. The first of those six trials, in which Officer William Porter faced charges including involuntary manslaughter, ended in a hung jury.  That threw States Attorney Marilyn Mosbys aggressive schedule into disarray, and a judge last month rejected prosecutors request to order Porter to testify against his fellow officers while he awaits retrial.

Kentucky county to appeal federal ruling striking right-to-work law,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - Officials for a Kentucky county will appeal a federal judges ruling that invalidated its right-to-work law, the countys lawyer said on Thursday. The ruling came a year after labor organizations sued Hardin County after it passed an ordinance that prohibited unions from mandating its members pay dues in exchange for representation. So-called right-to-work laws allow employees at unionized employers to skip joining a union and avoid paying union dues. U.S. District Judge David Hale ruled on Wednesday evening that local regulation of union agreements is preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. Hales order means that only states can implement such legislation. Democrats, who hold a majority in the state House of Representatives, have blocked repeated bills aiming to make Kentucky the 26th right-to-work state. These illegal ordinances would have affected all working people, union and non-union, by decreasing wages, lowering median household incomes, increasing poverty and undermining workplace safety, said Kentucky State AFL-CIO President Bill Londrigan. Beginning in late 2014, several Kentucky counties began passing their own laws after advocates claimed Kentucky law granted counties the same abilities as the state. Proponents of right-to-work laws say they can be a tool to attract new businesses. The ruling affects only Hardin County in north-central Kentucky, one of 12 to have passed a right-to-work law. Four others have passed a first reading. Jim Waters, president of the Bluegrass Institute, said about 80 of Kentuckys 120 counties had considered passing a right-to-work law but were waiting for Hales decision. John Lovett, a lawyer representing Hardin County, said the case pits the interests of local communities against the nations most powerful labor unions. Few issues are more local than what a working person is free to do with his or her own money, Lovett said. ",politicsNews,"February 4, 2016 ",1
Senate panel approves Obama's pick to lead forces in Afghanistan,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Senate committee approved on Thursday President Barack Obamas pick to lead U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan. Lieutenant General John Nicholsons approval by the Senate Armed Services Committee came during a hearing with the outgoing U.S. commander in Afghanistan, General John Campbell.

Senator presses U.S. derivatives regulator over accounting error,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts is turning up the heat on the U.S. derivatives and commodities regulator over an accounting error that could mean it has deficient funds. Roberts, a Kansas Republican,sent a letter dated Feb. 3 to Timothy Massad, head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, calling for answers on the error, according to the committee. The letter included a list of 11 questions for the CFTC to answer and a request for a detailed briefing before Feb. 17. Pressure has mounted on the agency since last month after Reuters reported that auditing firm KPMG took the extremely rare action of withdrawing nearly a decade of financial opinions about the agencys accounts when it learned of a significant material error related to leases. The auditor estimated the CFTC had understated liabilities by $194 million in the year to Sept. 30, 2015, and by $212 million the previous year. Lawmakers are concerned that the CFTC has violated a federal law prohibiting government agencies from obligating or spending federal funds in excess of the amount available. The nonpartisan federal watchdog, the Government Accountability Office, is  investigating whether the leasing errors put the CFTC afoul of the anti-deficiency law. What I find particularly troubling is in 2011 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission faced a similar dilemma concerning its leasing practices and how it accounted for its leases,Roberts wrote, referring to the top U.S. securities regulator. Considering the similarity between the agencies, the similarity of the issues, the public Congressional inquiries and the gravity of errant accounting, I am bewildered as to how CFTC finds itself in this current state of affairs. The questions Roberts posed revolve around how much guidance KPMG and the White Houses Office of Management and Budget provided the CFTC. He also asked about the accounting practices the commission uses and how closely it monitors its books. ",politicsNews,"February 4, 2016 ",1
U.S. Navy examining rise in health issues among F/A-18 pilots: lawmaker,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy is investigating a rise in health issues reported since 2009 by pilots of Boeing Co F/A-18 and EA-18G fighter jets, that may be related to insufficient oxygen or other factors, a key U.S. lawmaker said Thursday. Representative Michael Turner, chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces, said pilots had to report any episodes in which they experienced a loss in performance related to insufficient oxygen, depressurization or other factors present during flight. Turner said the Navy had set up a special team to investigate the incidents and determine the root cause, but it would be a complex process since symptoms related to depressurization, tissue hypoxia and contaminant intoxication often overlapped. We understand that determining the root cause or causes of physiological episodes in F/A-18 aircraft is a work in progress, Turner said at the start of a hearing on naval strike fighters.

Democratic hopefuls Sanders and Clinton spar over 'progressive' credentials,"(Reuters) - Democratic presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton battled over their progressive credentials at a town hall on Wednesday, but also reflected on their spirituality, a topic that more commonly dominates the narrative on the other side of the political aisle. Sanders, speaking at the televised event in Derry, New Hampshire, built on an earlier back-and-forth between the two candidates on Twitter and in appearances in the state, which  hosts the second party-nominating contest on Feb. 9, reminding voters that he and Clinton have made different decisions on backing the Iraq war, taking money from Super PACs and energy policies. Some of my best friends are moderates, but you cant be a progressive and a moderate at the same time, Sanders said at the town hall, hosted by CNN, which included questions from voters. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke immediately after Sanders at the town hall.  I was somewhat amused today that Senator Sanders has set himself up to be the gatekeeper on who is a progressive, because under the definition that was flying around on Twitter and statements from his campaign, Barack Obama would not be a progressive, Joe Biden would not be a progressive ... so Im not going to let that bother me, she said. Her campaign issued a press release during Sanders appearance, listing Clintons efforts fighting for progressive causes including health care and education. I know where I stand, I know who stands with me, I know what Ive done, Clinton said. Moderator Anderson Cooper, referring to criticism from Sanders that Clinton is too close to Wall Street, asked her about the more than $600,000 she received from speaking to the investment bank Goldman Sachs. Thats what they offered, Clinton said, adding that the payments havent had any effect on her calls to rein in the big banks. The two candidates arrived in New Hampshire on Tuesday, a day after Clinton marked a narrow victory in the Iowa caucuses, the first nominating contest leading up to the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Sanders, an independent U.S. senator from Vermont who is a democratic socialist, is polling more than 15 points ahead of Clinton in New Hampshire, but is trailing her nationally by roughly the same amount. During the town hall, Sanders fielded a question about how he would appeal to a broader swath of the electorate, including minority and religious voters - blocs he will need to draw to the polls if he hopes to maintain momentum against Clinton in upcoming nominating contests in the South and West. Everybody practices religion in a different way. To me, I would not be here tonight, I would not be running for president of the United States, if I did not have very strong religious and spiritual feelings, said Sanders, who, if elected, would be the first Jewish U.S. president. My spirituality is that we are all in this together, Sanders added. Clinton, a former first lady and former U.S. senator who has spent decades in public life, fielded a question that elicited a similarly spiritual response, speaking of balancing the role of public servant and her sense of self. I get a scripture lesson every morning from a minister that I have a really close personal relationship with, Clinton said. He gets up really early to send it to me, so you know, there it is, in my inbox at 5 a.m. Clinton is seeking to manage expectations about her performance in next weeks New Hampshire primary, saying Sanders has an advantage because he is from a neighboring state. But Clinton shows huge polling leads in the next round of primary contests in Nevada and South Carolina. The results from New Hampshire could shift momentum in the Democratic race. Clinton had hoped for a strong finish against Sanders in Iowa to vanquish his insurgent candidacy. In New Hampshire, she hopes to overcome his polling lead.

Obama visits a mosque to send pointed message to non-Muslims,"CATONSVILLE, Md. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama made his first visit to a U.S. mosque on Wednesday, in an effort to allay the fears of Americans accustomed to pop-culture portrayals of Muslims as terrorists, and to reassure Muslim American youth about their place in the nation. Obama, declaring that attacks on Islam were an attack on all religions, decried the inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslims from Donald Trump and other Republican presidential candidates. We have to understand that an attack on one faith is an attack on all our faiths, he said at the mosque outside of Baltimore, which he said had received threats twice in the past year. When any religious group is targeted, we all have a responsibility to speak up. Trump, the Republican front-runner, called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States after authorities described a California couple who killed 14 people last December as radicalized Muslims inspired by Islamic State militants. Obamas visit was aimed at showing Americans another side of Islam. Before he spoke, Cub Scouts who attend a school run by the mosque carried the American and Maryland state flags into the prayer hall, a plain room save for a three rows of window panes, 99 in all, each depicting one of the names of Allah in Arabic. Think of your own church or synagogue or temple, and a mosque like this will be very familiar, said Obama, who, following Islamic custom, took off his shoes to enter the hall. The children led the audience, with some men in prayer caps and most women in head scarves, in the Pledge of Allegiance. A man and a woman recited a verse from the Koran about tolerance and inclusion. Obama, a Christian, outlined the tenets of Islam, and gave a brief history of Muslims in America. He noted that founding father Thomas Jefferson specifically mentioned Muslims when he spoke about the American right to freedom of religion. Thomas Jeffersons opponents tried to stir things up by suggesting he was a Muslim, so I was not the first, said Obama, who has long been accused of secretly being a Muslim, to a roar of laugher. Im in good company, he said. Obama asked a row of Muslim American military service members to stand, as well as Ibtihaj Muhammad, a member of the U.S. fencing team who will be the first American Olympian to compete in a hijab, or head scarf, in this years Rio Olympics. The president touched on pop-culture depictions of Muslims as terrorists. Our television shows should have some Muslim characters that are unrelated to national security, Obama said. Turning to extremist groups such as Islamic State and what he characterized as perverted versions of Islam portrayed by them, Obama urged regular Muslims to show who you are. To use a little Christian expression - let your light shine. Later, he told a crowd of cheering children, who had packed the mosques gymnasium to watch his speech on large screens, that one day they too could become president. Obama urged young Muslims not to embrace a worldview that required them to choose between faith and patriotism. You fit in here. Right here, he said. Youre not Muslim or American. Youre Muslim and American. ",politicsNews,"February 3, 2016 ",1
U.S. senator introduces bill to speed electronic warfare weapons,"SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Mark Kirk on Wednesday introduced legislation that would give the Pentagon more flexibility in funding electronic warfare programs and speed often sluggish acquisition times. Current acquisition rules make it tough for the U.S. military to quickly procure and field electronic warfare weapons systems before they are overtaken by developments around the world. Kirk, an Illinois Republican and retired naval intelligence officer, said the bill would help the U.S. military accelerate work on electronic warfare weapons and stay ahead of other countries that are rapidly developing their own capabilities. It is critical our military dominate the offensive and defensive ends of electronic warfare, Kirk said in a statement. The need for enhanced electronic capabilities is even more pronounced on todays battlefield. Senator Kristen Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, is co-sponsoring the bill. The bill would amend the fiscal 2016 defense policy bill to include electronic warfare, or EW, under the Pentagons Rapid Acquisition Authority (RAA) program. That program lets program managers waive some acquisition rules to more quickly field technology. It would also allow the department to use different contract types, including those used for commercial items, when it buys EW weapons. The bill also includes directives for the Pentagons new joint Electronic Warfare Executive Committee, which is headed by Air Force General Paul Selva, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, according to a Kirk aide. The bill directs the committee to provide a strategic plan for the services to work together on electronic warfare systems, and tackle acquisition and budget processes, bolster training, fill capability gaps and advance offensive capabilities. Kirk is expected to discuss the legislation during a visit to a Northrop Grumman Corp facility in Rolling Meadows, Il. on Friday, the aide said. ",politicsNews,"February 4, 2016 ",1
"U.S. Republican questions timing of $1.7 billion Iran payment, hostage release","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A powerful U.S. lawmaker on Wednesday demanded Secretary of State John Kerry provide an explanation of a $1.7 billion claim settlement paid to Iran just as Tehran released American prisoners last month. Republican Ed Royce, chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote that the timing of the settlement and the administrations failure to brief Congress has led some to express concern that the payment represents a de facto ransom for the release of American hostages. Royce asked Kerry to provide by Feb. 17 information including lists of all U.S. officials who participated in negotiations with Iran over the settlement agreement, the prisoner release and the nuclear agreement announced in July. He also asked for legal analyses of the dispute, a timeline of negotiations over the dispute and an explanation of how the interest payment in the settlement was calculated, among other information. On Jan. 17, the State Department said the United States and Iran had settled a longstanding claim at the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, releasing to Tehran $400 million in funds frozen since 1981 plus $1.3 billion in interest. State Department spokesman John Kirby said Kerry would respond to the letter. He did not offer further specifics on when and how. We can confirm receipt of Chairman Royces letter, and as with all Congressional correspondence, well respond as appropriate, Kirby said. U.S. Republican lawmakers, who are strongly critical of Democratic President Barack Obamas Iran policy, have been questioning the payment for weeks. No Republican supported the nuclear agreement when Congress had the opportunity to review it last year. After the settlement was announced, Obama said it was a better alternative than letting more interest accumulate while waiting for a legal judgment. ",politicsNews,"February 4, 2016 ",1
Obama budget to adjust health insurance 'Cadillac tax': adviser,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will propose tailoring the controversial Cadillac tax on expensive private health insurance plans to reflect regional differences when he releases his 2017 budget plan next week, a senior White House adviser said in an article released on Wednesday. Obama's proposal would reduce the bite of the unpopular tax by raising the threshold where it takes effect in areas where healthcare is particularly expensive, according to the article in the New England Journal of Medicine co-written by Jason Furman, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. (bit.ly/1QdGlDG) The tax on high-cost employer-based healthcare plans, passed as part of the presidents 2010 Affordable Care Act and set to take effect in 2018, has generated growing opposition in part because labor unions say it could encourage employers to cut back on health insurance plans for workers. The tax was expected to raise some $87 billion a year to help pay for the reform generally known as Obamacare.   White House officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Republican campaign for White House turns nastier as field narrows,"HENNIKER, N.H. (Reuters) - Campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination took a nasty turn on Wednesday with billionaire businessman Donald Trump accusing rival Ted Cruz of fraud as the field of candidates narrowed ahead of next weeks New Hampshire primary. Rand Paul, a U.S. senator from Kentucky with a libertarian philosophy, pulled out of the Republican race. Conservative Rick Santorum also exited the race on Wednesday and endorsed U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Both Paul and Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, did poorly in Mondays Iowa caucuses, which were won by Cruz, with Trump and Rubio finishing second and third. The caucuses were the first of the state-by-state nominating contests ahead of the Nov. 8 election to replace Democratic President Barack Obama.  Trump, a real estate mogul and former reality TV star, went on Twitter on Wednesday to accuse the conservative U.S. senator from Texas of stealing his victory in Iowa. Cruzs team hit back by telling Trump to seek help for addiction to the social media site. The two men are going head-to-head for voters in New Hampshire, where Cruzs evangelical Christian credentials will not likely be as helpful as they were in Iowa. Opinion polls show Trump with a roughly 20-point lead in New Hampshire before next Tuesdays primary.                         As the New Hampshire race heats up, the Democratic presidential contenders will face off later on Wednesday in a town hall-style event hosted by CNN. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton narrowly beat Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, in Iowa.  Trump called for the nullification of Cruzs Iowa victory or a new vote in the state. Ted Cruz didnt win Iowa, he stole it, Trump said in a series of tweets. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad! Oh that voter fraud, you know, these politicians are brutal, Trump said later at a rally in Little Rock, Arkansas. They are a bunch of dishonest cookies, I want to tell you. Trump referred to an email that Cruzs campaign sent on Monday that implied another Republican candidate, Ben Carson, was about to drop out of the race and that his Iowa backers should be urged to vote for the Texan instead. Cruz later apologized for the email. Trump also accused Cruzs team of sending out a mailer designed to look like an official electoral document to scare Iowa voters into turning out at the caucuses. The accusations were the latest aggressive tactic from Trump, who has courted controversy with attacks on other candidates and by urging a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and branding Mexican immigrants as criminals. Obama visited a mosque near Baltimore on Wednesday, declaring that attacks on Islam were an attack on all faiths, in a move to counter rhetoric from Trump and other Republican candidates that have alienated Muslims. The Cruz campaign said Trumps complaint was a cry for attention after the senator came from behind in the polls to win on Monday. A Cruz spokesman suggested he seek help for Twitter addiction. It is no surprise that Donald is throwing yet another temper-tantrum, or if you like, yet another Trumpertantrum, Cruz said. I understand that Donald finds it very hard to lose  but at the end of the day, the Iowa people spoke. Cruz won support in Iowa from much of the same conservative Christian constituency that helped Santorum to victory in the Iowa caucuses during the 2012 presidential campaign. But Santorum failed to take off in the 2016 race. He said on Fox News he was suspending his run and called Rubio a born leader. The endorsement came as Rubio came under attack by rivals seeking to curry favor in New Hampshire. Rubio said he looked forward to teaming up with Santorum. We want to use him as often as hes willing to work for us, Rubio said. Earlier on Wednesday, Paul became the second Republican to drop out of the race since the Iowa caucuses, after former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.

Trump accuses Cruz of stealing Iowa caucuses through 'fraud',"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday accused rival Ted Cruz of stealing a victory in the Iowa caucuses and called for another vote or nullification of Cruzs win. Trump, who finished second behind Cruz, lit up Twitter on Wednesday with a series of posts saying the outcome was tainted because the Cruz campaign had deliberately spread misinformation about Trumps stand on Obamacare and an erroneous report that Ben Carson was dropping out of the race. Trump had gone into Mondays caucus voting ahead of the Texas senator by five percentage points in a key poll but Cruz ended up winning, four points ahead of the New York billionaire. Ted Cruz didnt win Iowa, he stole it, Trump (@realDonaldTrump) tweeted. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad! Several social media users tweeted screengrabs of an alleged deleted tweet from Trumps official account, in which he said Cruz illegally stolen the vote. Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified, Trump wrote. In another tweet, Trump said Cruz had lied about his opinion of President Barack Obamas healthcare program. And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and choice - a total lie! he said. Cruz had apologized to Carson on Tuesday because of an email from his campaign before the caucuses, which are the crucial first vote in the U.S. presidential nominating process. The press is reporting that Dr. Ben Carson is taking time off from the campaign trail after Iowa and making a big announcement next week, the Cruz email read, according to CNN. Please inform any Carson caucusgoers of this news and urge them to caucus for Ted Cruz. Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud, Trump tweeted. Wednesday afternoon, Cruz responded to Trumps Twitter rant. Yet another #Trumpertantrum, Cruz (@tedcruz) wrote in a retweet of one of Trumps posts. @realDonaldTrump very angry w/the people of Iowa. They actually looked at his record.  Carson had tweeted his feelings about the Iowa vote on Tuesday. Shameless tactics & dirty political plays defined yesterdays #iacaucus, he said, using a popular hashtag to refer to the voting. There is no place for this kind of behavior.

U.S. Republican Rand Paul suspends 2016 White House campaign,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Rand Paul suspended his 2016 presidential bid on Wednesday after his small-government campaign failed to gain traction with voters. The U.S. senator from Kentucky was the second Republican candidate, behind former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, to drop out of the race since Mondays nights Iowa caucuses. That contest launched the parties process to nominate candidates for the November election. Its been an incredible honor to run a principled campaign for the White House. Today, I will end where I began, ready and willing to fight for the cause of Liberty, Paul said in a statement. In the Republican race, the libertarian-leaning Paul finished in fifth place in Iowa with 4.5 percent of the vote. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz finished first in Iowa, putting a dent in real estate tycoon Donald Trumps standing as front-runner to be his partys nominee. Paul, who is also focused on winning another U.S. Senate term, said he would continue fighting for limited government, criminal justice reform and reasonable foreign policy. The heir apparent to the libertarian-minded voters who helped his father gain a standing in the last two presidential elections, Paul struggled to attract support in a crowded Republican field. His withdrawal leaves 10 Republican candidates in the 2016 White House race. ",politicsNews,"February 3, 2016 ",1
U.S. House panel offers alternative to retirement adviser rule,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation to bypass the U.S. Labor Department and have Congress set standards for brokers who give retirement advice passed a major committee on Wednesday and is now headed to the full House of Representatives. Although the bill faces slim chances of becoming law, it reveals the depth of feuding in Washington over the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform laws requirement that retirement advisers follow a fiduciary standard that puts their clients interests first. The requirement aims to end potential conflicts of interest by brokers who advise on individual retirement accounts and to protect consumers from buying unnecessary investment products that line brokers pockets.  Last week, the Labor Department sent a revised proposal for an adviser rule to the White Houses Office of Management and Budget. Details will not be made public until the White House completes its review. This was the departments second stab at a rule. Wide criticism from the industry and lawmakers alike forced it to withdraw its initial proposal in 2011.  The House Ways and Means Committee split along party lines as it debated the legislation, which would create a best interest requirement and lay out processes for advisers to follow.  Republicans, the majority, touted it as a workable alternative to the Labor Departments rule, which they said could frighten off middle-income investors from seeking advice and give advisers incentives to work only for wealthy clients.  They took issue with how the Labor Department drafted its rule, as well, saying the first version was panned by thousands of people and complaining that the current version lacked transparency. Just disclose it, said Rep. Peter Roskam, of Illinois, who helped write the bill, in comments directed at the department. Youve written it. Its done. Its not holy text. Democrats said lawmakers should wait to see the Labor Departments rule before bypassing it. They also complained there were no hearings on the bill, introduced in December, and said industry pressure was behind a sudden rush to pass it. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, would likely veto the legislation if it passed both the House and the Senate. Democrats cautioned that the bills major effect, then, will be to hamper negotiations lawmakers might want to have with his administration. Since the initial version was released, Democrats have raised potential problems they see in the rule with the Labor Department. ",politicsNews,"February 3, 2016 ",1

U.S. lawmakers chastise officials at all levels over Flint crisis,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers criticized environmental officials at a hearing on Wednesday for not acting sooner when they saw a report that drinking water in Flint, Michigan was polluted with dangerously high levels of lead. I never thought this could happen in America, and in a state, surrounded by fresh water of the Great Lakes, Brenda Lawrence, a Democrat of Michigan, said at a House Oversight panel examining the water crisis in Flint, a city of 100,000. The panel issued subpoenas to officials who did not show up to testify about water found to have lead levels that hamper brain development and cause other health problems. Thousands of children are believed to have ingested the polluted water in Flint, a mostly African American and Latino suburb near Detroit. Lawrence asked Keith Creagh, head of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, why his agency did not act on a report by a federal Environmental Protection Agency expert that showed the water was polluted. She did not get a clear answer. We all share responsibility in the Flint water crisis, whether it is the city the state or the federal government, we all let the citizens of Flint down, said Creagh, who took the job last month. Marc Edwards, a water engineer who first raised the issue of Flints lead contamination, told the panel the EPA broke laws by not notifying the public about a report of tainted water. If its not criminal, I dont know what is. EPA water official Joel Beauvais said he did not know why his agency did not tell the public. Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the committee, complained that the Republican-led panel did not invite Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican, to testify at the hearing. Representative Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania criticized Snyder and his hand-picked emergency managers for Flint who were responsible for switching the source of Flints tap water from Detroits system to the Flint River, a dumping area, in April 2014. Flint is grappling with the health and political fallout over the switch after the more corrosive river water leached lead from old pipes into the system. He got caught red handed poisoning the children of Flint, Cartwright, a Democrat, said of Snyder. Theres no two ways about it. Thats the headline here. A Snyder spokesman responded in an email: Its unfortunate when people who are not working toward a solution inject partisan politics and incendiary rhetoric into an emergency that can best be addressed by people working together. Snyder will ask state lawmakers in his next budget proposal to approve a $30 million water payment relief plan for Flint residents to keep their water service on and reimburse them for lead-contaminated water they cannot drink, his office said. A busload of Flint residents traveled to Washington to attend the hearing. Were serious about making sure that the people responsible for this manmade disaster are held accountable, said Bernadel Jefferson, a bishop. Lawmakers also slammed the EPA for not sending Administrator Gina McCarthy to Flint until this week, even though the agency has known about the crisis for months. An EPA spokeswoman said the agency had formed a Flint task force last October, and has had a team there for weeks. The head of the oversight panel, Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, a Republican, said he subpoenaed EPAs Susan Hedman to appear at a deposition in Washington later this month. Hedman, who announced last month that she would resign on Feb. 1, had played down the memo by the EPAs Miguel del Toral that said tests had shown high levels of lead, telling Flint and Michigan administrators it was only a draft report.  The EPA has agreed to provide all of Hedmans emails by the end of the week, Chaffetz said.  Chaffetz said his panel had also issued a second subpoena to Darnell Earley, who was Flints state-appointed emergency manager when the city switched from Detroits system. A. Scott Bolden, Earleys lawyer, said his client has not been given enough time to respond to the initial subpoena, which was served last night. Bolden said Earley is not hiding anywhere and will honor a subpoena issued with a reasonable response time. Earley only implemented the plan to change the citys water source that others had put in place before he started, Bolden said. There was nothing put before him by the environmental folks, the water testers or anyone connected to ensuring the quality of the water to suggest in any way that a water disaster was looming. Political fallout over the crisis could also hold up a wide-ranging bill on energy. Democrats in the Senate threatened to block a bipartisan energy bill if it fails to include immediate aid for Flint.  Federal authorities including the FBI have started a criminal probe into the contamination. ",politicsNews,"February 3, 2016 ",1
House Speaker Ryan urges conservative unity in election year,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday called on his fellow conservatives to unify in an election year, warning them to refrain from the kind of infighting that frustrated and eventually drove out his predecessor, the more moderate John Boehner. Ryan, in remarks to Heritage Action, one of the influential conservative groups that vexed Boehner with constant demands for more spending curbs and smaller government, said divisions among Republicans played into the hands of Democrats. Lets not fight over tactics. Dont impugn peoples motives, said Ryan, the Wisconsin congressman who took over the top post in the Republican-dominated U.S. House of Representatives last October. But as he spoke, discontent was brewing among conservative Republicans in the House over the U.S. budget for the coming year. Late last year, more than 160 Republicans out of 246 voted against a two-year budget deal Boehner reached with the administration of Democratic President Barack Obama. On Wednesday, Ryan did not mention Boehner by name. He urged conservatives not to use their disagreements, including over appropriations, as a litmus test for supporting each other. Its fine if you disagree ... But we cant let how someone votes on an amendment to an appropriations bill define what it means to be a conservative, Ryan said. He cautioned conservatives against standing in a circular firing squad.  Heritage Action is an affiliate of the conservative Heritage Foundation research group. Boehner blamed such outside groups for pushing him into a 16-day government shutdown in 2013. He retired last September, weary from fighting with more conservative members who have increased their numbers in the chamber in the past few years. Ryan could soon see Republican unity tested over decisions  on fiscal policy, also a theme in the campaign for the November presidential election. The budget deal reached late last year exceeded strict spending caps by $80 billion over two years, to pump up defense and domestic programs. It is to be used as a framework for budget and appropriations legislation this year. Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus did not vote for it. Ryan, trying to allay concerns, hosted the Freedom Caucus in his office Tuesday evening for budget and beers, a spokeswoman said. Freedom Caucus member Representative John Fleming of Louisiana said the meeting was cordial, with Ryan listening to the groups objections to higher spending. We didnt walk out with any agreements, Fleming said. Also on Tuesday, Obama and Ryan had their first formal meeting as they search for areas where they may be able to overcome policy differences.

"As his stature rises, Rubio becomes ripe target for rivals","LACONIA, N.H. (Reuters) - Marco Rubio finished third in Mondays Iowa caucuses, but his Republican White House rivals are attacking him as though he were the victor, and on Wednesday the U.S. senator from Florida peppered his speech with humble caveats that seemed designed to deflect the hits. As the 2016 candidates looked ahead to Tuesdays New Hampshire primary, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has called Rubio the boy in the bubble, suggesting he gives the same speech no matter where he goes. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who is campaigning for former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, said Rubio could not win a general election because of his positions on abortion and immigration. Bush and Ohio Governor John Kasich both said the country needed an experienced commander in chief, in what appeared to be a jab at Rubio, a first-term senator. In the run-up to the Iowa caucuses, Republicans Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, two anti-establishment candidates, had dominated the polls in the state while Rubio lagged well behind. But on Monday, he racked up a surprisingly strong third-place finish, garnering the support of 23 percent of Republican caucus goers, just below Trumps 24 percent second-place finish. Cruz, a senator from Texas, won Iowa with 28 percent. Many pundits had predicted Rubio would struggle to get much above 15 percent to 20 percent in the state. Rubio struck a triumphant tone in his post-caucus speech. This is the moment they said would never happen, he said, adding that the people of Iowa had sent a very clear message. On Wednesday, though, he gave a cautious outlook on his prospects in New Hampshire and beyond. Rubio said he was leaving his fate in the Republican U.S. presidential primary contests in Gods hands, and added that he hoped his children would be proud of him no matter how this turns out. I just want to do as well as we possibly can here in New Hampshire, Rubio told reporters. After emerging as the leading establishment candidate competing with Trump and Cruz, Rubio faces high stakes in New Hampshire. His elevated stature in the race has given his rivals added incentive to attack him. Some voters in the state seemed to be warming to him. Grace Freije, 63, of Bow, New Hampshire, said she had decided to support Rubio after gravitating earlier toward Christie. Steve McMahon, 65, said the same.  Hes not a divisive person, McMahon said. This guys got the best shot at winning.   (Reporting By Emily Flitter; Editing by Caren Bohan and Jonathan Oatis) SAP is the sponsor of this content.

House lawmakers propose $1 billion in aid for struggling coal country,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chair of the House of Representatives appropriations committee introduced a bill on Wednesday that would channel $1 billion to revitalize battered coal-producing communities. House Appropriations Chair Hal Rogers, a long-serving Kentucky Republican, said the RECLAIM Act would provide support to coal-producing communities hit by the decline of the industry to redevelop their economies. Under the bill, which he introduced with both Democrats and Republicans from Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania, $1 billion would be released from the governments Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) program to help communities generate new economic activities.  Many coal communities in Appalachia simply do not have the resources to reclaim the abandoned mine sites within their borders, said Rogers, who represents eastern Kentuckys coal-mining counties. This bill allows these communities to be proactive in restoring these sites and utilize them to put our people back to work. The bill comes after months of talks with the Obama administration, which last year proposed the POWER+ Plan, a multibillion-dollar strategy to support the revitalization of coal country using unused funds from the AML, which consists of fees on coal companies collected over the years. Republican lawmakers had initially been reluctant to support the administrations plan because they blamed its policies, including regulations forcing power plants to cut carbon emissions tied to burning coal, for the contraction in the coal industry that has seen some of its companies go bankrupt. The bill reflects a few modifications to the White House proposal, including measures to compensate Western states. Wyoming pays the most into the AML because it is still an active low-sulfur coal producer, yet most federal money would likely flow to older coal mining regions like Appalachia. A White House official said the RECLAIM Act is consistent with the administrations proposal. The legislation introduced today would bring $1 billion in much needed investment to support abandoned mine land reclamation linked with economic development in struggling coal communities that badly need both, the official said. Representative Matt Cartwright, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said the bill will create new opportunities for the families that depended on mining jobs, benefits, and pensions that have disappeared as coal companies have closed their operations. Local communities welcomed the bill and urged its swift passage. This is what weve been waiting on. This bill, and the money that could come from the bill into our local economies, could give us a little more security, said Kimberly Shepherd, a member of grass-roots group Kentuckians For The Commonwealth.

Connecticut's governor says no return to pre-recession prosperity,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy delivered a downbeat address on Wednesday, outlining plans to slash government spending and admitting to a visceral feeling that there was no going back to the prosperity of pre-recession years. The short and somber address came on the heels of a presentation by Malloys top budget official, who called for $570 million of reductions next year on top of millions in cuts and tax hikes in previous years. Our national economy, while making progress from the Great Recession, was fundamentally changed, Malloy, a Democrat, said at his annual state of the state address. A shifting workforce, the rapid rise of technology, and stagnant wage growth have made this recovery tougher for everyone, everywhere. Connecticut has consistently lagged the national economic recovery and has been hit by job losses in its key financial and high-tech manufacturing industries.  The state has one of the worst funded pension systems in the nation. With required payments set to balloon to $6 billion by 2032, the system presents a significant risk to the budget. Connecticut is not going back to that pre-recession reality, Malloy told the Democrat-dominated legislature. It just doesnt exist anymore. Connecticuts woes show how U.S. states have shared unevenly in the recovery since the financial crisis of 2007-2009. Andrew Cuomo, governor of neighboring New York, felt confident enough to tout a $100 billion infrastructure plan in January. Its been a really hard recovery, said Douglas Offerman, an analyst at Fitch Ratings. The old paradigm that you would exceed your past peak in every expansion doesnt appear to be holding right now. Ben Barnes, Malloys top budget official, said the replacement of higher-paying jobs with lower- and middle-wage positions had been a major story in Connecticuts budget ills.  Barnes proposed cuts of 5.75 percent to the budgets of state agencies, which could mean the elimination of several thousand jobs. He said cuts to discretionary spending would amount to 15 percent over two years.  At the start of the legislative session, Malloy urged lawmakers to pass an early budget and not wait until the last day of the fiscal year on June 30. But he said he would not circumvent the process. The governor proposed overhauling the way the state runs its budget to bring the process more in line with revenue projections, shifting away from a current services model. He also said lawmakers should implement a spending cap. ",politicsNews,"February 3, 2016 ",1
New Hampshire to test broader appeal of Cruz's Southern conservatism,"HENNIKER, New Hampshire (Reuters) - Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruzs performance in New Hampshires primary election on Tuesday will be a referendum on the Southern evangelicals appeal to Northern conservatives, a breed he is not used to courting. Cruz is fresh off a victory this week in Iowa, the first contest in the race for the nomination ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election, and the U.S. senator from Texas is betting his undiluted religious conservatism will deliver a strong finish in New Hampshire. Cruzs campaign does not anticipate a win in New Hampshire. Polling shows national front-runner Donald Trump - who has tighter links with the region as a New Yorker - with a roughly 20 point lead in the state.    But placing second will be crucial if Cruz hopes to keep momentum in a crowded Republican field that includes Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush and John Kasich. It could also foretell his appeal in the populous Northeastern states in later contests. We dont expect to win here, Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler told Reuters in New Hampshire. We expect to do well here. At a town hall event in Windham, New Hampshire, this week, Cruz - wearing jeans with a silver-plated belt and an open-collared shirt - pitched himself to voters as the candidate who could unite disparate groups of conservatives in the mold of former Republican President Ronald Reagan. What were seeing that is so encouraging - its what we saw last night in Iowa, but its what were seeing in New Hampshire and all across the country - is were seeing that old Reagan coalition coming back together, Cruz said. As in Iowa, Cruz in his New Hampshire appearances invoked Bible verses, emphasized religious freedom and closed by asking the crowd to pray that God would awaken the body of Christ to pull us back from the abyss. Cruzs scripture-infused style was well-aimed at Iowas evangelicals but could be less suited for one of the least religious states in the country. Some people who have knocked on doors for Cruz in New Hampshire said they had heard complaints about Cruzs propensity for quoting the Bible, and they instead tried to emphasize his tax plan or defense of their rights to own guns.  Robert Diack, 53, a Cruz supporter from Pelham, New Hampshire, said he appreciated Cruzs willingness to share his faith but thought other, more liberal voters could be turned off. It will be interesting to see how he fares here, he said. Conservative culture-clash has been a problem for other Republican campaigns too. Recent Republican Iowa winners, including former Senator Rick Santorum in 2012 and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee in 2008, had weak showings in their New Hampshire contests.     But Cruzs campaign co-chair in New Hampshire, William OBrien, said the campaign had made a clear decision not to adjust his approach for New Hampshire. In this race, the best way to connect with voters is to be genuine. Thats why hes not tailoring his message here, he said. Weve talked a lot about this since weve been together. This strategy could play into Cruzs efforts to brand himself an authentic conservative in contrast to Trump whom Cruz paints as a political chameleon with New York values.     Trump leads the Republican field nationally with 38.4 percent in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll. Trumps second-place finish in Iowa came as a surprise, as did the strong third-place result by U.S. Senator Rubio of Florida. Cruz has also invested in a robust ground game in New Hampshire. His campaign rented a 40-bed dorm in Chester to house some of its 2,000 volunteers, and door-knockers and callers use apps to target potentially receptive voters. He has a real organization with real money behind it, said Charlie Arlinghaus, president of New Hampshire free-market think tank Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy. Cruz had $19 million on hand at the end of 2015.  But he has also been criticized for making fewer than 20 visits to New Hampshire, less than many rivals. Cruzs spokesman said the senator is keeping some focus on later primary states, including those where a Southern conservative message may resonate more strongly.

Obama to visit U.S. mosque to counter Republican rhetoric about Muslims,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama was set on Wednesday to make his first visit to a U.S. mosque, a trip the White House said was aimed at countering rhetoric from Republicans on the presidential campaign trail exploiting some Americans fears about Muslims. In the trip to the Islamic Society of Baltimore, Obama wants to highlight the American right to freedom of religion for all, including Muslims, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. Weve seen an alarming willingness on the part of some Republicans to try to marginalise law-abiding, patriotic Muslim Americans.And it is offensive, Earnest told reporters. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States after a California couple who killed 14 people last December were described by authorities as radicalised Muslims inspired by Islamic State militants. Republicans vying to be the partys candidate for the Nov. 8 presidential election also argued against Obamas plan to accept 10,000 refugees fleeing Syrias war, saying it raised national security risks. Republican candidate Ben Carson has said Muslims were unfit for the presidency of the United States. It has been a transparent strategy on the part of Republicans to play on peoples anxieties, to target religious minorities to advance their political ambition, Earnest said. Obama has called the comments a betrayal of American values, and said discrimination against Muslims plays into the hands of extremist groups like Islamic State. Muslim civil rights leaders have expressed alarm about anti-Muslim backlash, pointing to recent incidents where vandals have thrown bacon and even a pigs severed heads at mosques. Obama, who has visited mosques outside the United States on trips abroad, will first meet privately with a small group of Muslim community leaders before delivering remarks at the mosque at 12:05 p.m. ET. He is set to speak to the nations Christian leaders at the annual National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, and last week warned against the rise of religious intolerance during a ceremony at the Israeli Embassy.

Clinton clear on Trump: 'We were not friends': People magazine,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton wants to set the record straight on Donald Trump: We were not friends. We knew each other, obviously, in New York, Clinton, a former U.S. senator from New York, said in excerpts of a People magazine interview released on Wednesday. I knew a lot of people. Trump, the real estate billionaire whose standing as Republican front-runner was dented by a second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, had long touted his friendship with Bill and Hillary Clinton. In a March 2012 Fox News interview, Trump praised Clinton as a terrific woman. I am biased because I have known her for years. I live in New York. She lives in New York. I really like her and her husband both a lot. I think she really works hard, Trump told Fox. But the Clintons, who attended Trumps 2005 wedding, were fair game on the campaign trail.  In November, Trump said Hillary Clinton did not have strength or stamina to be president and called her the worst U.S. secretary of state, a post she held from 2009 to 2013. When Clinton denounced Trump last month for showing a penchant for sexism, Trump turned the phrase against her, using it to refer to Bill Clintons sexual scandals as president. Trumps caustic comments about Hispanics, women, Muslims and his rivals for the nomination have set much of the tone for the Republican race.  Clinton has accused him of being divisive and a bully. Clinton told People she could handle Trumps barbs, but worried about the immigrants and American Muslims he targets. Im more concerned about the tone that is being set in the political debate this year because the last thing our country needs right now is more divisiveness, more mean-spiritedness, she said.  It was not clear when the People interview, which included Clintons daughter, Chelsea, was conducted. Clinton won the Iowa Democratic caucuses over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday.  I really care about what he says about other people, who dont have the voice and the platform, Clinton said, referring to immigrants and American Muslims. Chelsea Clinton said she has never had a relationship with Donald Trump but remains friends with his daughter, Ivanka. I do believe that friendship is more important than politics, she told People. I would never hold anyone accountable for what their parents or anyone else in their family said or did.  (Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Bill Trott) SAP is the sponsor of this content.

Marco Rubio becomes early hope for mainstream U.S. Republicans,"EXETER, N.H./MILFORD, N.H. (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, emerging from the first presidential nominating contest in Iowa as the leading Republican mainstream contender, portrayed himself in New Hampshire on Tuesday as the partys best hope to recapture the White House. But Rubio, 44, a U.S. senator from Florida, faces a strong field of establishment rivals in next weeks New Hampshire primary after his stronger-than-expected third-place finish in Iowa behind front-runners Ted Cruz, 45, and Donald Trump, 69. If I am the nominee, we are going to beat Hillary Clinton and it wont be by the flip of a coin, Rubio told supporters in Exeter, New Hampshire, taking a jab at the close Democratic race in Iowa between Clinton and challenger Bernie Sanders, where some precincts were decided on a coin flip. Other more mainstream Republicans including former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Ohio Governor John Kasich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, are expected to do better in New Hampshire than in Iowa and vie with Rubio to become the establishment favorite. Cruz and Trump also headed to New Hampshire as the presidential race shifted to the second nominating contest in the state-by-state battle to pick nominees for the Nov. 8 election to replace Democratic President Barack Obama. Trump told a news conference before a rally in Milford, New Hampshire, that he felt a tinge of disappointment at losing to Cruz in Iowa.. The billionaire businessman also picked up an endorsement from former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown. Cruz told New Hampshire supporters he was like former Republican President Ronald Reagan, urging the state to help ensure his nomination by giving him a win in the Feb. 9 primary.  Every day from now until Election Day here in New Hampshire, Im going to continue asking for the men and women of New Hampshire to make that same fateful decision yet again so that we can reignite the promise of America, Cruz said. Cruz, a conservative U.S. senator from Texas, beat Trump in Iowas Republican caucuses with the help of the states large bloc of evangelical Christians, but he might struggle to finish on top in New Hampshire, where Republican voters have a more secular and libertarian streak. Cruz apologized to rival Ben Carson over an email his campaign sent on Monday night implying Carson was dropping out of the race and his Iowa backers should switch to Cruz. This was a mistake from our end, and for that I apologize to Dr. Carson, Cruz wrote.  The campaign for Carson, who finished fourth in Iowa, said the retired neurosurgeon had accepted Cruzs apology but that the incident was the sort of dirty trick politics that Carson was trying to fight. The Democratic presidential contenders, Clinton and Sanders, also headed to New Hampshire after their close duel in Iowa, where the former secretary of state narrowly edged out the insurgent U.S. senator from Vermont. Vermont borders New Hampshire, and that proximity may give Sanders an advantage in next Tuesdays primary. Clintons razor-thin margin was the smallest in Iowa Democratic caucus history. Concerns about the income gap and economic insecurity have helped Sanders, 74, a self-described democratic socialist who came from far behind in polls to throw a scare into the front-runner in Iowa. Clinton, 68, acknowledged she had to try harder to win younger Democrats, who backed Sanders in Iowa in large numbers. Im going to have some work to do to reach out to young voters, maybe first-time voters, who have to make a tough decision, she told CNN. The two Democrats also renewed a days-old battle over when and where to have more face-to-face debates, and were still talking about potentially meeting in a televised debate on Thursday night in New Hampshire. On the Republican side, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who dropped out of the race in December, said a recent hardening of Rubios position on immigration and the strength of his anti-abortion stance might cost him.      Running to the right to win Iowa is going to be a hard sell here in New Hampshire, Graham, a supporter of Bush, told Reuters in Rindge, New Hampshire. The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio said he was the candidate to unite the Republicans in the November election, when the party hopes to regain the White House after Obamas two four-year terms. People realized on the Republican side that we cannot afford - this country cannot afford - to lose this election, and that I give the party the best chance not just to unify our party but to grow it, Rubio told ABCs Good Morning America from Manchester, New Hampshire.   The fluent Spanish speaker hopes to win back some of the Latino vote the party lost in recent years as it toughened its stance on immigration. A foreign policy hawk, Rubio advocates a tough approach to Iran, the Islamic State militant group and other U.S. foes. Iowans who supported Rubio at the caucuses said they responded to his relatively positive message and viewed him as the candidate most likely to beat Clinton should she be the Democratic nominee.    Worries about issues such as immigration and terrorism have fueled the campaigns of Trump and Cruz. Christie on Tuesday accused Cruz and Rubio of lacking executive experience for the job of president. What do they do exactly in the United States Senate? They talk and they talk. They are not responsible for doing anything, Christie said at his campaigns New Hampshire headquarters in Bedford.  Opinion polls of Republicans show Trump leading nationally and in New Hampshire. But the state has a long tradition of bucking trends in presidential primaries. Trump, the outspoken real estate magnate who dominated the Republican race for months, broke an unusual silence of more than 12 hours on Twitter after his defeat in Iowa. Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa, I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz & Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor, he wrote on Twitter on Tuesday where he has regularly posted scathing criticism of his opponents.

Trump: 'Tinge' of sadness over losing Iowa,"MILFORD, New Hampshire (Reuters) - Donald Trump, the New York businessman seeking the Republican U.S. presidential nomination, said on Tuesday he felt a tinge of disappointment after losing to Texas Senator Ted Cruz in the Iowa caucuses. Cruz bested Trump with 28 percent of caucus-goers pledges on Monday compared to Trumps 24 percent. Florida Senator Marco Rubio came in a close third with 23 percent. Asked by a reporter if he felt at all bad about the result, Trump said, Theres a tinge...I probably had a tinge because a poll came out that said I was five points ahead.  In the weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Trump held leads in almost every statewide and national poll though his dominance in Iowa wobbled after Cruz won a key endorsement from a local evangelical Christian leader. Trump also said there was a chance his decision to skip a Fox News debate among Republican candidates on Thursday might have hurt him in the caucuses. Asked before a rally in Milford, New Hampshire on Tuesday evening if he planned to change his campaign strategy, Trump told a news conference he felt confident in his methods, but he was adding more town hall-style events. But any humility was fleeting as Trump went on to say he beat Rubio by getting support from almost 3,000 Iowans - Thats a lot of people - and that he had gotten a larger percentage of support than any other Republican candidate in history except for that one number, he added, referring to Cruzs win. He also said he had not tried very hard to win Iowa. I didnt devote tremendous time to it, he said. I didnt expect to do so well. Trump fielded question after question from reporters about why he thought he lost and whether it made him anxious about primary elections in other states ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. When he took the stage before more than a thousand people, Trumps swagger had returned. He criticized the media for focusing more on Rubios third-place showing than his second, calling journalists miserable people and encouraging the crowd to boo them. Fans interviewed before the rally said Trumps loss did not bother them.  I think hes done pretty well from the start, said Eli Johnson, 33, from nearby Brookline, New Hampshire. He did pretty well considering Cruz was praying with everyone at every rally (in Iowa) and theyre a really religious state. ",politicsNews,"February 3, 2016 ",1
