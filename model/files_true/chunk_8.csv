China says it wants smooth military ties with Trump,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Wednesday it wanted to develop smooth military-to-military ties with the new U.S. administration of Donald Trump. While the worlds two largest economies are frequently at odds over issues like the disputed South China Sea, both have been trying to improve trust between their armed forces to reduce the risk of misunderstanding in any encounters. This month, China and the United States staged a three-day humanitarian relief military drill as part of that trust-building exercise. New concern looms with Trumps election as U.S. president. He lambasted China on the campaign trail and has suggested Japan and South Korea be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. Asked about Trumps election, Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said it went without saying there were tensions in the military relationship and China hoped the United States would respect its core interests and concerns. China is willing to work hard together with the defense department of the next U.S. government to promote the healthy and stable development of military-to-military relations, Yang told a monthly news briefing. Trump will take over as president in January.  ",politicsNews,"November 30, 2016 ",1
Judge lets Wisconsin officials decide how to perform presidential vote recount,"MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - Local officials in Wisconsin will decide for themselves how to carry out a presidential election recount after a state judge on Tuesday rejected a lawsuit by former Green Party candidate Jill Stein to have the ballots counted by hand.  A recount of Wisconsins three million votes is set to begin on Thursday after Steins campaign requested the audit and paid the states $3.5-million filing fee, state election officials say.   Dane County Circuit Judge Valerie Bailey-Rihn ruled that Wisconsins 72 county clerks will not be required to count ballots by hand as Stein requested in a lawsuit filed on Monday, Attorney General Brad Schimel said in a statement.   Bailey-Rihn said Steins lawsuit, backed by the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, fell short of  Wisconsins legal standard to ban use of ballot machines in a recount and failed to show enough evidence of fraud or other issues, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said.  I follow the law. Thats who I am, despite my personal opinions, said Bailey-Rihn, the Journal reported. Its (the counties) decision. Its their discretion. I may disagree with it  but I must follow the law. The ruling will not deter Steins efforts, a lawyer for her campaign recount effort said, referring to the hand counting of ballots as the gold standard. We are calling onall counties to respect the will of Americans across the country and across the political spectrum, and follow the recommendation of the judge, and conduct a hand recount to ensure the accuracy, security, and integrity of this election, Matthew Brinckerhoff said in a statement.   Stein has also sought a recount in Pennsylvania on Monday, just hours before the states deadline, and her campaign said she would file a similar request in Michigan by its deadline on Wednesday. Election integrity experts have independently identified Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as states where statistical anomalies raised concerns, her campaign said on its website, seeking donations to pay for recount filing fees.  Donald Trumps stunning victory in the presidential contest has unleashed talk of recounts, with the Republican president-elect contributing a surprise twist. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that serious voter fraud occurred in California, New Hampshire, and Virginia, states that Clinton won. All three states rejected Trumps claim, and the White House on Monday said there had been no evidence of widespread election fraud in the presidential contest.

"Trump picks loyalists for economic posts, Obamacare critic for cabinet","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump chose a former Goldman Sachs banker and a billionaire investor on Tuesday to steer economic policy in his administration and a fierce Obamacare critic to dismantle President Barack Obamas signature healthcare program.  Republican Trump is expected to name Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner and Hollywood financier, as his nominee for Treasury secretary, a source said, putting a Wall Street veteran in the top U.S. economic Cabinet post. Mnuchin, who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving in 2002 to launch a hedge fund, served as Trumps campaign finance chairman. Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, known for his investments in distressed industries, is expected to be named commerce secretary, a source said. The announcements could come as early as Wednesday. The flurry of picks showed Trump, a real estate tycoon with no governing experience, rewarding loyalists and established Washington veterans as he rounds out his circle of top advisers. Republican U.S. Representative Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon from Georgia, will be Trumps health and human services   secretary. Seema Verma, the founder of a health policy consulting company, will lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is part of Health and Human Services and oversees government health programs for the poor and the elderly and insurance standards. Trump also announced his choice of Elaine Chao, labor secretary under President George W. Bush, to serve as secretary of transportation, saying in a statement that her expertise would be an asset in our mission to rebuild our infrastructure. While Trump made decisions on his economic team, he continued to mull over who should serve as his top diplomat. He dined with former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, a one-time critic and the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, at a French restaurant in New York on Tuesday night. Romney sharply criticized Trump during the presidential campaign but he offered praise after their dinner. He continues with a message of inclusion, of bringing people together, Romney told reporters. He said Trumps Cabinet choices so far and speech on Election Night were encouraging.     Trump cast Price and Verma as a dream team to help him once he takes office on Jan. 20 with his campaign pledge to repeal Obamacare, the health law formally known as the Affordable Care Act. It has been a target of Republican attacks since its enactment in 2010. Price has characterized Obamacare as doing real harm to American families and has co-sponsored legislation to replace it. Verma helped Pence, the Indiana governor, add conservative pieces to Medicaid coverage for the states poor by requiring beneficiaries to make contributions to health savings accounts. She also worked on Medicaid programs in Iowa, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee. Chuck Schumer, the incoming Senate Democratic leader, was among the defenders of Obamacare who criticized Prices selection. Nominating Congressman Price to be the HHS secretary is akin to asking the fox to guard the hen house, Schumer said.  The 2010 healthcare overhaul, aimed at expanding insurance coverage to millions more Americans, triggered a long, bitter fight between the White House and congressional Republicans, who said it created unwarranted government intervention in personal healthcare and private industry. Trump has said he will replace Obamacare with a plan to give states more control over Medicaid and allow insurers to sell plans nationally. Price and Verma will both need Senate confirmation. Congressional approval will be needed to repeal and change the health law. White House spokesman Josh Earnest defended Obamacare on Tuesday, saying it had expanded coverage to millions of Americans, boosted consumer protections and shored up the finances of the Medicare program for the elderly. Well see if Trump care measures up, he said. Trump said after meeting Obama following his Nov. 8 election victory that he would consider keeping the provisions of the healthcare law that let parents keep adult children up to age 26 on their insurance policies and that bar insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions. Price, an early Trump supporter in the U.S. House of Representatives who leads the budget committee, has proposed a plan that would create age-based tax credits for people who buy insurance coverage on their own. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Tuesday the eventual congressional plan to replace Obamacare would likely have much in common with Prices ideas. Prices plan would also roll back the 2010 laws expansion of Medicaid for low-income people, a change that helped Obamacare cut the number of uninsured Americans to 29 million in 2015 from 49 million in 2010.  Trump vowed on the campaign trail to save Medicare, but Democrats said Prices plans could amount to privatizing the government program for the elderly. Price has endorsed converting Medicare from a program that covers set benefits to a voucher-style program to help people buy coverage. We say to Republicans who want to privatize Medicare: Go try it. Make our day, Schumer said on Tuesday, saying the change would be unpopular with the public. Democrats also criticized the pick because Price has supported barring federal funds for Planned Parenthood, which provides some abortions in addition to birth control, health exams and other services. Trump has met about 70 people as he looks to shape his White House and Cabinet team. Chao, his pick for transportation secretary, was the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position, as labor secretary. She is married to Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Trump saw retired General David Petraeus, a potential candidate for the State Department or the Pentagon, on Monday. On Tuesday, he met Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Corker and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, as well as Romney, are in the running for secretary of state. Trump is set to launch a thank you tour of states he won in the election, starting with a rally on Thursday in Cincinnati, aides said. ",politicsNews,"November 28, 2016 ",1
CIA's Brennan says tearing up Iran deal would be 'folly',"LONDON (Reuters) - Outgoing CIA Director John Brennan has said it would be the height of folly for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to tear up Washingtons deal with Tehran because it would make it more likely that Iran and others would acquire nuclear weapons. It could lead to a weapons program inside of Iran that could lead other states in the region to embark on their own programs, Brennan said in an interview with the BBC aired on Wednesday.  So I think it would be the height of folly if the next administration were to tear up that agreement. Brennan also said that in dealing with the Syrian crisis, Trump should be cautious in trying to work with Russia. I hope there is going to be an improvement in relations between Washington and Moscow, he said. President-elect Trump and the new administration need to be wary of Russian promises. Russian promises in my mind have not given us what it is that they have pledged. ",politicsNews,"November 30, 2016 ",1
Federal judges order North Carolina to redraw legislative districts,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - A U.S. federal court on Tuesday set a March 15 deadline for North Carolina state lawmakers to redraw legislative districts found to be racially gerrymandered, and ordered a new round of elections by next November for the 28 seats at stake. In August, the same special three-judge panel ruled that nine state Senate districts and 19 state House districts, as carved out in a plan adopted by the Republican-controlled legislature in 2011, were unconstitutional. The panel had told North Carolinas legislature to start revamping its political maps immediately, but left the existing boundaries intact for the Nov. 8 state elections, because of time constraints. While special elections have costs, those costs pale in comparison to the injury caused by allowing citizens to continue to be represented by legislators elected pursuant to a racial gerrymander, the panel wrote in its seven-page order on Tuesday. North Carolina has already appealed the August ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court, which has yet to act. Republicans also vowed to appeal Tuesdays ruling, handed down by two U.S. district judges and one circuit judge. The ruling is a politically motivated abuse of judicial authority, said state Senator Bob Rucho and Representative David Lewis, the Republican chairmen of the House and Senate redistricting committees. If upheld, the court order is a gross overreach that blatantly disregards the constitutional guarantee for voters to duly elect their legislators to biennial terms, they said. Last year, the Southern Coalition for Social Justice challenged North Carolinas latest political maps, saying  legislative district lines were drawn in 2011 so as to dilute the states black vote and give Republicans an advantage. The three-judge panel that heard the case agreed, and Tuesdays order, essentially an extension of its August opinion, was hailed by the North Carolina Democratic Party. A separate three-judge U.S. court panel ruled in a similar case a week ago that state assembly districts in Wisconsin, as redrawn by its Republican-led legislature, were unconstitutionally gerrymandered. Tuesdays North Carolina ruling sets a deadline of March 15 for newly elected legislators to approve a redistricting plan that passes constitutional muster. It also requires the state to hold special primary and general elections in the late summer and fall of 2017 to fill those 28 House and Senate seats. Moreover, state lawmakers elected to any of the disputed General Assembly seats in 2016 will serve for just one year, instead of the normal two, the court ruled, a limit set for those elected next fall as well.

Trump expected to name former Goldman banker Mnuchin for Treasury: source,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name former Goldman Sachs partner and Hollywood financier Steven Mnuchin as his nominee for Treasury secretary, a source said on Tuesday, putting a Wall Street veteran in the top U.S. economic Cabinet post. Mnuchin, who was Trumps presidential campaign finance chairman, could be named as early as Wednesday, said a Republican source close to the decision. Mnuchin was chosen over several high-profile candidates, including JPMorgan Chase Chairman Jamie Dimon and Republican U.S. Representative Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee.  Mnuchin is the first person with extensive Wall Street experience to head the Treasury since his former boss, Henry Paulson, the former Goldman Sachs chief executive who served under President George W. Bush and steered Treasury through the chaotic initial stages of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The current Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, worked for two years at Citigroup but has spent most of his career in government or academia. The selection of Mnuchin was first reported by The New York Times. A relatively little-known but successful private equity investor and hedge fund manager, Mnuchin spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving in 2002, when he launched Dune Capital Management. With Dune, Mnuchin has invested in movies produced by Rupert Murdochs 20th Century Fox and Time Warner Incs Warner Bros, including blockbusters Avatar, Mad Max: Fury Road and Suicide Squad. The son of a Goldman Sachs partner who became an art dealer, Mnuchin worked hard to step outside his fathers shadow and make a name for himself, former colleagues said, rising to become the firms chief information officer in 1999. He wanted to prove that he was there on the merits, said a former Goldman colleague, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Mnuchins experience running Goldmans mortgage-backed bond trading desk would later prove valuable when an opportunity arose in 2009 to buy the deeply discounted assets of failed California mortgage lender IndyMac Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation during the financial crisis.  He assembled an investor group that included hedge fund  manager John Paulson to buy the assets for $1.55 billion, and moved to Los Angeles.  After rebranding the operation OneWest Bank, Mnuchin built it with other assets and professional sports team sponsorships into Southern Californias largest bank, with 73 branches and $23 billion in assets. His group sold OneWest to CIT Group Inc last year for $3.4 billion. The bank came under fire for its foreclosure practices as housing advocacy groups accused it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. In 2011, dozens of demonstrators descended on Mnuchins $26.5 million home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood to protest OneWests eviction tactics, according to the Los Angeles Times. This month, two housing groups filed a complaint asking the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to investigate complaints that OneWest engaged in discriminatory redlining practices against black and Latino communities. Mnuchin must be confirmed by the Senate and the top Democrat on the chambers Finance Committee signaled he may be in for tough questioning. Given Mr. Mnuchins history of profiting off the victims of predatory lending, I look forward to asking him how his Treasury Department would work for Americans who are still waiting for the economic recovery to show up in their communities, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden said in a statement.  Although Mnuchin has a reputation for being a behind-the-scenes player in Hollywood, he appears on screen in the 2016 film Rules Dont Apply, according to the IMDB movie database. The drama, which opened in theaters on Nov. 23, stars Warren Beatty, who also wrote and directed the film. ",politicsNews,"November 29, 2016 ",1
Health industry breathes easier as post-Obamacare path stabilizes,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hospitals and health insurers are gaining confidence that their nightmare scenario - millions of Americans instantly losing health insurance once President-elect Donald Trump delivers on a promise to repeal and replace Obamacare - is looking more like a bad dream than becoming reality. The early view from the healthcare sector still includes an end eventually to President Obamas signature health program. But Trumps picks to head the U.S. health department and its top regulator on Tuesday, along with his recent softening on some aspects of the existing law, is a sign to some sector insiders that instead of chaos, an orderly transition of up to three years to replace it with a plan that healthcare companies actually want could be in store. Trump tapped Republican Representative Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon who drafted legislation years ago to replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), as head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Consultant Seema Verma, who helped Vice President-elect Mike Pence create a Medicaid expansion plan in Indiana, is his choice to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Both must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.  Democrats bemoan the choices, saying they will gut the 2010 law that gave insurance to about 20 million people through the creation of new individual health insurance and the expansion of Medicaid for the poor. But some healthcare companies, including insurers, doctors groups and hospitals, said they were encouraged by the appointments of experienced healthcare insiders. From our standpoint, we want to make sure that as many people as possible maintain (insurance) coverage, said Dr. Mario Molina, CEO of Molina Healthcare, which provides Medicaid and Obamacare individual insurance plans. I think the pieces of the healthcare puzzle are kind of coming together for us now. That picture looks increasingly like lawmakers will bring Trump a repeal bill in January that lays out at least a two-year timeline for changing the law. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Tuesday that the House would start working on repealing and replacing Obamacare right away, but with a transition period to allow changes to be phased in over time. That period could be up to three years, warned Senate Finance committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, in order to work through the problems.  Kathleen Harrington, chair of Policy of Government Relations for the Mayo Clinic, said so far she likes what she hears from Republicans on changes to health insurance.   We are very encouraged with the approach were hearing so far from President-elect Trump in terms of having a focused review and removing certain parts of it, she said. The key for Republicans is shifting the bulk of the oversight of individual insurance and the Medicaid program to the states, and changing the way both are funded.  Insurers, who currently submit individual plans to both the state and the federal government, say this will allow them to sell more flexible health plans. For hospitals, the Verma appointment and Pences Medicaid expansion in Indiana are signs that one of their major sources of government reimbursement for medical services could continue to grow. To be sure, it remains unclear what the overall impact will be on Medicaid and Medicare going forward. Both insurers and hospitals are watching for any negative impact from any changes, and anticipated cuts in funding. Investors have already been playing the winners and losers of reforming health insurance. The Nasdaq Biotechnology index has gained 7 percent since Trump was elected as the possibility of Hillary Clinton enacting new legislation on drug pricing disappeared. On the other hand, shares of hospital chains have sold off sharply, including a 26 percent decline for Tenet Healthcare, on the fears that millions of newly uninsured patients will need care but not be able to pay their bills if and when the ACA is repealed. Pence, who is expected to take a large role in shaping the administrations healthcare policy, backed a plan in Indiana developed by Verma in which beneficiaries contribute to the cost of their healthcare. Its pretty clear that she is on the side of expanding Medicaid, but putting some conditions on it, said Joseph Antos, a health policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Antos expects the replacement plan to also include individual insurance that has a form of Federal subsidies, as envisioned in House Speaker Paul Ryans proposed plan to replace Obamacare. AgileHealthInsurance.com, which sells short-term health insurance plans that are allowed to exclude benefits guaranteed under the ACA, expects the law to allow more choice so that insurers can design cheaper plans to hit a certain price point of $100 per month or $200 per month, as they did before the ACA, according to executive director Sam Gibbs.  Prices of Obamacare insurance rose about 25 percent for 2017 and large insurers including UnitedHealth Group have abandoned plans for next year, saying that they are losing too much money on sick customers. Under Price and Verma, it could be the states once again making most of the decisions about mandatory benefits with the Federal government providing only a broad framework, Gibbs suggested.  At benefits company Stride Health, which sells and manages healthcare benefits to gig workers like Uber drivers, CEO Noah Lang said that he would want to be sure that the replacement plan has tax credits available to people as they need them, rather than at the end of the year only. Blair Childs, senior vice president at hospital purchasing group Premier, said members of Congress are already asking healthcare companies for input on a roadmap for the ACA replacement.  The offices weve talked to are saying Dont talk to me about what you dont want, talk to me about what you do want. How do we solve this? Childs said. The Ryan plan, known as A Better Way, envisions block grant funding for Medicaid, the creation of vouchers for Medicare coverage, and the elimination of the advance paid premium subsidies for individual insurance. It is seen as the foundation of the eventual plan. Some Republican lawmakers hope that this new health reform law will get Democratic support and pass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate. Price, who has presented his own replacement plan, is now turning to a job of managing a massive agency that oversees the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Medicare, Medicaid, the Childrens Health Insurance Program and other programs, and will be tasked with implementing what Congress ultimately sends him, Childs said. The relevant thing is the Ryan plan and what elements of that can be put into law, Childs said. ",politicsNews,"November 30, 2016 ",1
Trump flag-burning tweet leads activists to burn some flags in New York,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A small group of hard-left activists burned foot-long U.S. flags outside the Trump International Hotel in New York on Tuesday, in an angry response to a tweet by President-elect Donald Trump that flag-burners should face legal consequences. Social media was itself ablaze on Tuesday in response to Trumps tweet, which suggested that burning the U.S. flag should be punishable by a year in jail or a revocation of citizenship. Trumps provocative tweets on flag-burning and other topics, including efforts to recount the Nov. 8 presidential vote, came as the Republican worked to fill his Cabinet in advance of his inauguration in January. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that flag-burning was not a crime but rather a form of protest protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution. The high court has also ruled more than once that citizenship cannot be revoked. U.S. media outlets, including the New York Times, published articles detailing the court rulings, and some Republicans as well as Democrats took to social media to say Trump was in effect threatening to punish dissent despite constitutional protections. Trump supporters also took to social media, pointing out that many politicians, including Trumps Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, had proposed making flag-burning illegal. Clinton, while a U.S. senator, co-sponsored a 2005 bill that would have made it a crime to incite violence by burning a flag, threaten another person with a burning flag or destroy or damage a flag belonging to someone else. The measure failed. Tuesdays protest in New York involved seven members of the Revolutionary Communist Party, a group that is not affiliated with the Communist Party of the United States, and whose members participated in flag-burning at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July.

Factbox: Trump fills top jobs for his administration,"(Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name former Goldman Sachs partner and Hollywood financier Steven Mnuchin as his nominee for Treasury secretary and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross to head the Commerce Department, according to Republican sources. The following is a list of Republican Trumps selections for top jobs in his administration: Mnuchin, 53, is a relatively little-known but successful private equity investor, hedge fund manager and Hollywood financier who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs (GS.N) before leaving in 2002. He assembled an investor group to buy a failed California mortgage lender in 2009, rebranded it as OneWest Bank and built it into Southern Californias largest bank. The bank came under fire for its foreclosure practices as housing advocacy groups accused it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. Ross, 78, heads the private equity firm, W.L. Ross & Co. His net worth was pegged by Forbes at about $2.9 billion. A staunch supporter of Trump and an economic adviser, Ross has helped shape the Trump campaigns views on trade policy, blaming the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and the 2001 entry of China into the World Trade Organization for causing massive U.S. factory job losses. Chao, 63, was labor secretary under President George W. Bush for eight years and the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position. Chao is a director at Ingersoll Rand, News Corp and Vulcan Materials Company. She is married to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: U.S. REPRESENTATIVE TOM PRICE Price, 62, is an orthopedic surgeon who heads the House of Representatives Budget Committee. A representative from Georgia since 2005, Price has criticized Obamacare and has championed a plan of tax credits, expanded health savings accounts and lawsuit reforms to replace it. He is opposed to abortion. U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: GOVERNOR NIKKI HALEY Haley, a 44-year-old Republican, has been governor of South Carolina since 2011 and has little experience in foreign policy or the federal government. The daughter of Indian immigrants, Haley led a successful push last year to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina state capitol after the killing of nine black churchgoers in Charleston by a white gunman. DeVos, 58, is a billionaire Republican donor, a former chair of the Michigan Republican Party and an advocate for the privatization of education. As chair of the American Federation for Children, she has pushed at the state level for vouchers that families can use to send their children to private schools and for the expansion of charter schools. [L1N1DO0KC] Sessions, 69, was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trumps presidential bid and has been a close ally since. The son of a country-store owner, the senator from Alabama and former federal prosecutor has long taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.  NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: RETIRED LIEUTENANT GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN Flynn, 57, was an early supporter of Trump and serves as vice chairman on his transition team. He began his U.S. Army career in 1981 and served deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. Flynn became head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2012 under President Barack Obama, but retired a year earlier than expected, according to media reports, and became a fierce critic of Obamas foreign policy. Pompeo, 52, is a third-term congressman from Kansas who serves on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA, National Security Agency and cyber security. A retired Army officer and Harvard Law School graduate, Pompeo supports the U.S. governments sweeping collection of Americans communications data and wants to scrap the nuclear deal with Iran.

Compromise reached on massive U.S. defense bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A compromise version of a massive U.S. defense policy bill omits controversial provisions such as a clause Democrats said allowed discrimination against homosexuals and a requirement that women register for the draft. The $618.7 billion National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, will likely come up for a vote in the House of Representatives late this week, and the Senate next week, senior committee staff members told reporters at a background briefing on Tuesday. During months of negotiations, Republicans and Democrats on the Senate and House Armed Services committees agreed to eliminate a religious freedom provision Democrats said would have let federal contractors discriminate against workers on the basis of gender or sexual orientation. The amendment, introduced by Republican Representative Steve Russell, would have overridden President Barack Obamas 2014 executive order barring federal contractors from discriminating against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender workers. The 2017 NDAA also leaves out a requirement that women register for the military draft. Many Republican lawmakers, uneasy with moves toward allowing women in combat, had objected to that provision. Instead, the NDAA requires a study of the entire selective service system.  The bill also provides a 2.1 percent increase in military pay, the biggest such raise in five years. The bill could run into problems with Democrats. It includes $3.2 billion more in defense spending than Obama requested, which is not matched by a similar increase in non-defense spending. Obama vetoed last years NDAA because of a similar increase for the Pentagon, part of a continuing tug-of-war between Republicans and Democrats over spending policy. The NDAA keeps language restricting transfers from the military prison at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base that was included in previous bills. Those restrictions were one reason Obama vetoed the 2016 NDAA, but he later signed a version of the legislation that included them. Lawmakers also agreed to slash the White Houses National Security Council to no more than 200 positions, from about 400, after Pentagon complaints the NSC was too involved in decision-making. The NDAA expands a program to provide visas to Afghans who worked for the U.S. military and diplomats as interpreters, allowing a further 1,500 visas. It omits protections for the greater sage grouse. House Republicans do not want the bird to be declared an endangered species, arguing it would put too much land in the western United States off limits for military training.

Trump expected to pick investor Wilbur Ross as U.S. commerce secretary,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name Wilbur Ross, a billionaire known for his investments in distressed industries, to head the Commerce Department, a Republican source familiar with the decision told Reuters on Tuesday. An announcement on Ross to lead the department, which pursues anti-dumping cases against cheap foreign imports, could come as early as Wednesday, NBC News said. Ross declined to comment to Reuters on Tuesday. Ross, 78, a staunch supporter of Trump and an economic adviser, has helped shape the Trump campaigns views on trade policy, blaming the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and the 2001 entry of China into the World Trade Organization for causing massive U.S. factory job losses.   I think theres a big difference between the impact of trade agreements on corporate America and the impact on Mr. and Mrs. America, Ross told CNBC in an interview earlier this year. Corporate America has adjusted to them by investing lots of capital offshore.     Ross, whose net worth was pegged by Forbes at about $2.9 billion, heads the private equity firm, W.L. Ross & Co in New York. Ross connections to Trump date back to 1990, when as a turnaround expert for Rothschild and Co he worked on behalf of bondholders to help engineer a restructuring of hundreds of millions of dollars in debt owed on Trumps Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. In 2002, by then in charge of his own private equity firm, Ross formed International Steel Group to consolidate several bankrupt steelmakers, including Bethlehem Steel, Acme Steel and LTV Steel. He sold the company in a $4.5 billion deal two years later to Mittal Steel. Ross retains a stake in what is now part of the worlds largest steel company, Arcelor Mittal, and sits on its board of directors. His various business interests, which also include automotive components and textiles, could make avoiding conflicts of interest a complicated prospect as the head of an agency with broad influence over trade cases and U.S. industrial policies.  Arcelor Mittal has benefited from several recent anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties imposed by the Commerce Department against a wide range of steel products from China, South Korea, Japan, Britain, Turkey and other countries. Those have helped lift domestic steel prices, boosting the companys bottom line. Ross may also face questions from lawmakers over the January 2006 Sago coal mine disaster in West Virginia that killed 12 miners in an explosion and collapse. Owned by a subsidiary of one of his companies, International Coal Group, the mine had been cited for more than 200 safety violations  International Coal was sold for $3.4 billion in 2011 to No. 2 U.S. coal miner Arch Coal, which filed for bankruptcy protection in January amid plummeting coal prices.  He could be questioned as well over a $2.3 million fine his firm agreed to pay in August to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle accusations it did not properly disclose some fees that it charged investors.

No formal U.S. delegation to Castro memorial: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will not send a presidential delegation to Cuba for communist leader Fidel Castros memorial service, the White House said on Tuesday, reflecting the tortuous history of U.S.-Cuban relations. Instead, Ben Rhodes, an aide to President Barack Obama who conducted 18 months of secret negotiations that led to the 2014 U.S.-Cuban rapprochement, and Jeffrey DeLaurentis, the senior U.S. diplomat in Havana, will represent the United States. The choice reflects a White House desire to acknowledge the history of U.S.-Cuban enmity as well as Obamas normalization of relations with Cuba, a policy that could be tempered or reversed when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. There are many aspects of the U.S.- Cuba relationship that were characterized by a lot of conflict and turmoil, not just during the Castro regime, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, citing U.S. concerns about Cuban respect for human rights. Earnest also accentuated the positive, noting that Rhodes, a White House deputy national security adviser who was already scheduled to be in Havana for meetings, played a leading role in crafting the normalization policy with Cuba. Cuba and the United States have been ideological foes since soon after the 1959 revolution that brought Castro to power. Washington broke diplomatic relations with Havana in 1961 as Cuba steered a leftist course that turned the island, which lies just 90 miles (140 km) south of Florida, into a close ally of the former Soviet Union. The decision not to send a presidential delegation may also aim to avoid criticism from opponents of rapprochement, which included last years formal restoration of diplomatic ties. Given the ugly history of U.S. relations with Fidel Castro, it is not surprising that President Obama has decided not to send a presidential delegation, said Ted Piccone, a Latin America analyst at the Brookings Institution think tank. Given President-elect Trumps threat to reverse the opening to Cuba, this may be the Obama administrations last and best opportunity to convey to the highest levels of the current Cuban leadership the urgency of accomplishing as much as possible before Trump enters the White House, Piccone added.

Pentagon warns against impact of extending temporary U.S. funding bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter voiced opposition to extending a temporary government funding bill well into next year, saying it would negatively impact the military, including in the fight against Islamic State.  Washington has been operating since Oct. 1 under a stopgap spending bill, known as a continuing resolution, to keep most federal programs running. It expires on Dec. 9. House and Senate leaders are negotiating the end date for a new temporary funding bill. The most problematic shortfalls DoD (Department of Defense) will face in a long-term CR (continuing resolution) are in the operations and munitions accounts that fund counterterrorism operations and assistance in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, among other priorities, Carter wrote in the letter to top Congressional leaders. Carter said the Pentagon had never been under such a situation during a presidential transition, calling it unprecedented and unacceptable. ",politicsNews,"November 29, 2016 ",1

Trump to nominate Elaine Chao for transportation post: source,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump plans to nominate former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao to head the Transportation Department, a source with knowledge of the decision said on Tuesday. The source, who requested anonymity, confirmed the pick to Reuters. Chao, the wife of Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, served as labor secretary under President George W. Bush and was the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position. The formal announcement was expected Tuesday afternoon. Although Trump spoke on the campaign trail about wanting to drain the swamp in Washington, more than half of Trumps nine key appointments so far have been accomplished Washington insiders, such as Chao. Chao will face a number of big decisions at the agency that regulates the nations vehicles, airplanes, railroads, pipelines, ports and highways - including how to proceed on self-driving cars on U.S. roads, the use of small unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, over people and whether U.S. fuel efficiency standards should be revised. There are dozens of other pending regulatory issues the next administration will face, including railroad safety and staffing rules, requiring event data recorders in all U.S. vehicles and whether to set rules for airlines requiring they give more passengers with disabilities seats with extra leg room and whether to ban or restrict phone calls made on personal phones on U.S. flights. She may also take a leading role in Trumps plans to rebuild U.S. infrastructure. Trump has called for $1 trillion in infrastructure spending over 10 years to rebuild airports, bridges and other projects, but it is unclear how much of the funding would come from the federal budget. Mitch Bainwol, chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group that has urged the Trump administration to conduct a sweeping review of auto regulations, praised Chao as a superb choice. He said the next administration will make important decisions on self-driving cars and how to maximize the rate of innovation in the technologies that save lives, avoid crashes and improve fuel economy. Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich praised Chaos expected nomination. She will be a great Secretary of Transportation. She really understands the federal government-can lead rebuilding our infrastructure, he wrote on Twitter. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Democrats want to work with Chao on fixing infrastructure but will not allow Republicans to use an infrastructure bill as a Trojan horse for undermining workers wages and handing massive tax breaks to big corporations.  Chao is a former deputy transportation secretary and sits on the boards of Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Ingersoll-Rand Co [IRCOM.UL], News Corp (NWSA.O) and Vulcan Materials Co (VMC.N). A Chinese immigrant, Chao arrived in the United States at age 8. Her father, James S.C. Chao, is founder of the Foremost Group, an international shipping company.

"After perceived snubs, UK's May calls Trump to strengthen ties","LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump agreed on Tuesday that they should work to build relationships through the U.S. transition and meet at the earliest opportunity. Britain has long cherished its special relationship with the United States as a central pillar of its foreign policy, but speculation has been widespread in London about how ties would evolve under Trump after a series of perceived snubs from him. The Prime Minister called the U.S. President-elect this afternoon as part of establishing a regular dialogue between both of them, Mays Downing Street office said in a statement. They discussed how the President-elects transition plans were progressing and agreed that their teams should continue to build close relationships through this period, including with a meeting of their National Security Advisers in the United States before Christmas, it said. Trump caused astonishment in London last week when he suggested that Nigel Farage of the opposition UKIP party, a firebrand of the Brexit cause and vitriolic critic of the ruling Conservatives, should be Britains ambassador to Washington. The government responded that there was no vacancy, but the suggestion, an unprecedented breach of diplomatic protocol, was embarrassing for Downing Street. Following his election, Trump spoke to nine other world leaders before he spoke to May, which also raised eyebrows in London. In Tuesdays call, the two leaders also discussed NATO, agreeing on its importance and on the need for more members of the alliance to meet the target of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense.  Britain already meets that commitment, but Trump has repeatedly complained about others falling short, raising concerns in other NATO countries about his intentions toward the organization.

Senate to vote on Iran sanctions renewal this week,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate will vote this week on a bill that would renew sanctions on Iran for 10 years, Senator Mitch McConnell, the chambers Republican leader, said on Tuesday in remarks as he opened the daily session. If the extension of the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) is passed as expected, it would be sent to the White House, where President Barack Obama is expected to sign it into law. The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly last month for the extension of the ISA, first passed in 1996 to punish investments in Irans energy industry and deter the countrys pursuit of nuclear weapons. The act will expire at the end of 2016 if not renewed. The Obama administration and other world powers reached an agreement last year in which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. But members of Congress said they wanted the ISA to stay in effect to send a strong message that the United States will respond to provocations by Iran and give any U.S. president the ability to quickly reinstate sanctions if Tehran violated the nuclear agreement. White House officials have said they did not think the reinstatement was needed, now that the nuclear agreement has been in effect for almost a year. But they also have not raised concerns that a renewal would violate the deal. ",politicsNews,"November 29, 2016 ",1
Factbox: Trump announces picks to fill two key healthcare posts,"(Reuters) - Republican U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday named a vociferous Obamacare critic and a consultant to help him overhaul the nations healthcare system. Republican Representative Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon from Georgia, will be Health and Human Services secretary, and consultant Seema Verma will lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a powerful agency that oversees government health programs and insurance standards, Trump said in a statement. Below are details about his selections: SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: U.S. REPRESENTATIVE TOM PRICE Price, 62, is an orthopedic surgeon who heads the House of Representatives Budget Committee. He has long criticized Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act, and has championed a plan of tax credits, expanded health savings accounts and lawsuit reforms to replace it. Price, who is also opposed to abortion, has represented the 6th Congressional District in Atlantas northern suburbs since 2005.  ADMINISTRATOR OF THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES: SEEMA VERMA Verma, 46, worked with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana, on a compromise to expand Medicaid coverage for the states poor with federal funding. The Indiana program requires beneficiaries to make monthly contributions to health savings accounts. She is the founder and chief executive officer of a national health policy consulting company and has provided advice on healthcare programs to Iowa, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee and Michigan. Sessions, 69, was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trumps presidential bid and has been a close ally since. A conservative from Alabama, he is serving his fourth term in the chamber, where he is a member of the Judiciary Committee with oversight of federal courts, immigration, crime and terrorism.  The son of a country-store owner, he is a former Army Reserve captain and was U.S. attorney for Alabamas Southern District under former President Ronald Reagan and later Alabamas attorney general.  Although he was confirmed by the Senate for his U.S. attorney post in 1981, he was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 when a Senate panel failed to advance his nomination amid allegations that he had made racially charged remarks, which he denied.  Sessions must secure Senate confirmation to lead the Justice Department as attorney general, but he would only need to win majority support in the Republican-controlled chamber. Sessions has long taken a tough stance on immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. During the Republican George W. Bush administration, he blasted a bipartisan effort to create a guest-worker program, backed by the president, for illegal immigrants. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: RETIRED LIEUTENANT GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN Flynn, 57, was an early supporter of Trump and is vice chairman of his transition team. A former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, he began his U.S. Army career in 1981 and served deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. He later worked in the Office of the Director of Intelligence.        Once a registered Democrat, Flynn became head of the DIA in 2012 under President Barack Obama. He retired a year earlier than expected, according to media reports, and became a fierce critic of Obamas foreign policy.  He went on to start his own consulting firm, which has come under scrutiny for its ties to a Turkish businessman. He told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday that he would sever connections with the businessman to take the post under Trump.     Flynn has said the United States should work more with Russia on global security issues. In an August interview with the Washington Post, he defended a paid speech for state-run Russian Television.     CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY DIRECTOR: U.S. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE POMPEO Pompeo, 52, is a third-term congressman from Kansas who is on the U.S House Select Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA, National Security Agency and cyber security. Pompeo also was a member of the House Select Committee on Benghazi investigating the 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Libya.   The California native graduated first in his class from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and served as a platoon leader in the U.S. Army before leaving the military as a captain to attend Harvard Law School. In 1996, he moved to Kansas to start an aircraft parts company. Its decision to open a factory in Mexico came under fire when Pompeo later ran for public office. He defended his work, saying the company had created jobs in the state. His ties to Koch Industries, owned by billionaire conservative donors Charles and David Koch, have also drawn scrutiny.  He won re-election in the Nov. 8 election with 61 percent of the vote, according to Kansass unofficial election results online. Pompeo has criticized former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked National Security Agency information, saying in a 2014 letter that his telecast appearance at an event undermined the ideals of fairness and freedom.

Trump vows to end U.S.-Cuba 'deal' unless Havana makes better one,"WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday he would end the United States deal with Cuba unless a better one was made, reflecting his campaign pledge to reverse President Barack Obamas moves to open relations with the Cold War adversary. If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal, Trump said in a Twitter post.  Some Cubans are worried Trump will shut down the U.S.-Cuban trade and travel ties that have begun to emerge in the past two years since Obamas historic decision to end decades of Cold War hostility and open an embassy in Havana. U.S. airlines launched the first regular flights to Havana in more than five decades on Monday. Trumps tweeted as Cubans commemorated Fidel Castro, the guerrilla leader who led a revolution in 1959 and ruled the Caribbean island for half a century. Castro died on Friday. During Trumps campaign for the White House he had said he thought restoring diplomatic ties with Cuba was fine but that Obama should have cut a better deal. Newsweek reported that one of his companies had attempted to do business in the Communist-ruled island. Later in the campaign, he toughened his rhetoric, seeking to reassure Cuban-American voters in Florida that he opposed Castro and his brother, Raul, to whom he turned over power in 2008. On Saturday, Trump said in a statement that his administration would do all it can once he takes office on Jan. 20 to boost freedom and prosperity for Cubans after Castros death. Cuba always has fiercely resisted what it sees as U.S. involvement in its politics. The government has stayed mostly quiet on Trump, waiting to see whether he converts his rhetoric into policy change. The makeup of Trumps transition team has suggested he could with the inclusion of Mauricio Claver-Carone, a leading advocate for maintaining a tough economic embargo, and Robert Blau, a hard-line anti-communist who was openly hostile toward the Castro government while posted as a diplomat in Havana during the administration of Republican President George W. Bush. Many Cubans are defiant, however, saying their main problem was the U.S. economic embargo. We have lived for 50 years with the blockade so we are going to continue living the same way with or without Trump, Teresa Almentero, 52, a cigar roller, said after paying tribute to Castro in Revolution Square. He doesnt scare me, nor does he scare any Cuban. ",politicsNews,"November 28, 2016 ",1

"U.S. companies hope Trump will stick to business roots, back Cuba ties","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. companies are looking for ways to persuade President-elect Donald Trump to soften his threats to cancel the Obama administrations opening to Cuba, a reversal they fear could cost them hundreds of millions of dollars. During his campaign, Trump said he thought restoring diplomatic ties with Cuba was fine, but that Democratic President Barack Obama should have pushed harder for concessions from Havana before easing restrictions on travel and trade. On Monday, three days after the death of revolutionary leader Fidel Castro, the Republican president-elect said in a Twitter post that he would end what he referred to as Obamas deal if Cuba did not do more for its people. But he did not promise to reverse the changes, and advocates for closer ties said they hoped the businessman-turned-politician would stay true to his roots and foster economic ties. He has said things that are frankly hopeful to folks on both sides of the debate, U.S. Representative Mark Sanford, one of several Republican lawmakers who back increased engagement, told Reuters. Trade associations for companies with business interests in Cuba hope to persuade Trump to continue Obamas opening, and have been discussing a joint effort to press the Republicans administration, a person with knowledge of the talks said. Trump won the White House on promises to create jobs. Advocates for increased engagement argue that promoting U.S. trade with Cuba would create opportunities, and jobs, in industries from telecommunications to agriculture, and particularly in tourism. Several U.S. airlines are already flying to Cuba, Starwood Hotels & Resorts signed a contract to manage a Cuban hotel and Carnival Corp has begun cruises to the island. While business in Cuba has yet to generate much revenue for U.S. companies, reversing Obamas policies could leave Americans out of a potential market or mean their investments so far have been wasted. If the U.S. continues to limit trade (with Cuba), and the European Union, China and Russia continue toexpand trade, there will be a smaller piece of cake left for U.S. companies, said Jose Maria Vinales Camallonga, director of International Operations at Lupicinio, a Spanish law firm that represents large corporations in their Cuba dealings. As Trump issued his tweet on Monday, American Airlines Flight 17, the first commercial flight in more than half a century between the United States and Havana took off for the Cuban capital, part of a wider push by U.S. carriers to boost flights there. If flights stopped or demand slipped because Trump imposed new travel restrictions, U.S. airlines could lose hundreds of millions of dollars in potential revenue in the years to come, said John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council. The Department of Transportation has authorized 1.2 million seats for trips to Cuba by commercial U.S. carriers per year, below the 3.4 million airlines requested, but representing significant revenue, he said. Cuba also represents a potential market for U.S. products such as chickens, wheat and rice, though U.S. farm exports to the island have actually fallen since Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro moved to normalize relations in December 2014. Still, lawmakers from several states with big agricultural sectors like Arkansas and Texas back closer ties. If Trump reversed Obamas Cuba policies he would have to take on one of his main constituencies, which is the business community, said Julia Sagebien, an expert on Cuban business at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia.  In a bid to cement Obamas Cuba policy before Trump takes over on Jan. 20, the administration has been encouraging U.S. companies to forge further business deals. More than half a dozen announcements, in areas from travel to manufacturing to telecommunications, had been expected in the next two months, a person familiar with the matter said. But Fidel Castros death and uncertainty about Trumps plans could affect that timeline, the person said. ",politicsNews,"November 29, 2016 ",1

Wide-ranging U.S. health bill expected to sail through House vote,"(Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives is expected to pass a $6.3 billion piece of legislation on Wednesday designed to spur medical innovation, speed access to new drugs, expand mental health treatment, and combat opioid abuse. The bill, known as the 21st Century Cures Act, provides $4.8 billion to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) over 10 years to support brain, cancer and precision medicine research. It also provides $500 million to the Food and Drug Administration to approve drugs and devices more quickly. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to cut red tape at the FDA. He has not commented specifically on 21st Century Cures. The U.S. Senate is expected to vote on the bill next week. It is expected to pass, though possibly not before some additional changes are made. It would then go to President Barack Obama for signature. The bill calls for $1 billion over two years to treat and prevent opioid abuse, including improving prescription drug monitoring programs, training for health care providers, and expanding access to opioid treatment programs. Critics of the bill, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democrat, said it contains too many give-aways to the pharmaceutical industry and will allow companies to push treatments with limited proof of efficacy. Speaking on the Senate floor on Monday, Warren said she could not vote for the bill despite its many positive elements and would not be a lackey for the drug industry. Warren, along with Republican Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, also objects to a provision that would allow companies to hide payments to doctors under the auspices of continuing medical education. Grassley co-authored the Sunshine Act which led to the creation of a database listing drug and device company payments to doctors. A lot of earlier payments to doctors were under the umbrella of Continuing Medical Education, Grassley said in a statement on Monday. We shouldnt create a loophole that would let drug and medical device companies mask their payments to doctors under a payment category thats too broad and could gut the spirit and the letter of the Sunshine Act. The bill would add an additional reporting exemption forphysicians who receive indirect payments for speaking fees. Patients groups hailed the bill, saying it would bring patient voices to the center of the drug approval process. This is a patient-centered bill, said Ellen Sigal, chair and founder of Friends of Cancer Research, a patient advocacy organization. It fosters innovation and doesnt lower safety standards.

Trump adds antitrust expert to Justice transition team,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Republican antitrust veteran has been named on Monday to U.S. President-elect Donald Trumps transition team for the Justice Department, a choice that lawyers say signals a more hands-off approach to antitrust enforcement compared to Democratic President Barack Obama. David Higbee, a partner at the law firm Hunton & Williams LLP, worked for President George W. Bushs administration from 2001 to 2005, spending the last year in the Antitrust Division. Since then he has advised clients on merger reviews, antitrust litigation and government investigations.  Higbee joins Joshua Wright, an economist and former commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, as the only two people on Trumps transition team with a background in antitrust. The Obama administration has challenged an unusually large number of mergers in the last few years, leading to the collapse of Halliburton Cos plan to buy Baker Hughes Inc, among others. Currently, the Justice Department is suing Anthem Inc to prevent it from buying Cigna Corp and Aetna Inc to stop its purchase of Humana Inc. While Trump, who campaigned as a populist, has talked tough on media mergers such as AT&T Inc buying Time Warner Inc, and singled out Amazon.com Inc for antitrust scrutiny, Higbees naming heralds a return to a traditional Republican view of merger enforcement, lawyers said. Higbee will have that sensible caution, said Bruce McDonald, another veteran of the Bush administration now at the law firm Jones Day. He will be more confident in business and markets and less confident that government can identify and fix problems. An antitrust division designed by Higbee would be tough on price-fixing and mergers of competitors but would be cautious in challenging deals where companies buy suppliers or incidents where companies are accused of breaking antitrust law to run competitors out of business, McDonald said.

Vote recount effort races forward despite Trump team rejection,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps transition team on Monday pushed back against an effort to recount Nov. 8s presidential election votes, calling the effort nonsense, but offering no evidence to back a weekend Trump tweet alleging millions of illegal votes. With the clock winding down for voters and candidates to seek recounts in states across the country, Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein requested a recount in Pennsylvania on Monday just hours before the states deadline. Filing in Pennsylvania three days after she filed a similar request in Wisconsin, Steins campaign said she would file a similar request in Michigan by its deadline on Wednesday. Following Trumps stunning victory in the presidential contest, talk of recounts has swirled, with the Republican president-elect adding a surprise twist to the discussion. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that serious voter fraud occurred in California, New Hampshire, and Virginia, states won by his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. All three states rejected Trumps claim. The White House said on Monday there has been no evidence of widespread election fraud in the presidential contest. Still, Wisconsin officials on Monday prepared to launch a recount of the states more than 25 million votes, following Steins request last week, a move that was joined by Clintons lawyers. If nothing else, this will give us a very good audit, Mark Thomsen, the chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said on Monday. Its going to reassure Wisconsin voters that we have a fair system, that were not counting illegal votes.  A statement on the Wisconsin Elections Commissions website said the recount was scheduled to begin on Thursday and had to be completed by Dec. 13. Steins campaign has raised the money needed to pay filing fees for recount requests in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. But she still aims to raise $800,000 more to cover fees for attorneys and other personnel needed to oversee the recount, said an official with her campaign. The official said any funds left over would be disbursed according to Federal Elections Commission guidelines. California voters still could request recounts there. But the deadline for requesting a recount in New Hampshire has already passed and the margin of victory in Virginia was larger than what is necessary for a recount to occur, according to election officials in those states. New Hampshires deputy secretary of state, David Scanlan, said there was no evidence supporting Trumps claims of widespread voter fraud. Voter fraud does occur, but it occurs in isolated instances, he said. California Secretary of State Alex Padilla called Trumps allegations unsubstantiated and Virginia Commissioner of Elections Edgardo Cortes said they were unfounded.

U.S. shifts money away from Philippines police drug efforts,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has shifted millions of dollars in funding for Philippines law enforcement away from police drug control programs, State Department officials said on Monday, since the start of the countrys bloody crackdown on drugs this summer. The Obama administration and human rights groups have criticized Philippines President Rodrigo Dutertes war on drugs, and U.S. officials have said they are deeply concerned by reports of extrajudicial killings in the drug campaign. Duterte has in turn rebuked the United States and rejected the criticisms. Police figures show the campaign has killed more than 2,500 people since Duterte took office on June 30, about three-quarters in police counter-narcotics operations, and the rest believed to be the victims of vigilantes or drug lords eliminating rivals or silencing those who could implicate them. Since the start of the campaign, U.S. State Department assistance for Philippines law enforcement has been diverted from narcotics control to maritime security and human rights training for the national police, State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a news briefing. We decided the prudent thing to do was to refocus the way that assistance was being spent, Kirby said.  Of $5 million that had been intended for Philippines law enforcement efforts, the State Department in early September shifted $4.5 million into maritime law enforcement, specifically to the Philippines Coast Guard and Bureau of Fisheries, a State Department spokeswoman said. Another half-million dollars is to go to human rights and internal reform efforts, she said. The State Department expects it will continue to focus its funding on maritime security, human rights, and rule of law programming, the spokeswoman said. The United States has sent the Philippines hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid and military and development assistance in recent years, making it the third-largest Asian recipient of U.S. military aid after Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Leahy Law, named for its sponsor, Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, bars the United States from providing training or equipment to foreign troops who commit human-rights violations. Earlier this month, Senate aides told Reuters the United States halted the planned sale of some 26,000 assault rifles to the Philippines national police after Senator Ben Cardin said he would oppose it, over what aides said were concerns about human rights violations.

"Trump, without evidence, says illegal voting cost him U.S. popular vote","PALM BEACH, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that he won the popular vote in the Nov. 8 election if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally, though he provided no evidence of widespread voter fraud.  The allegation by Trump, who won the required votes in the Electoral College to secure the presidency, comes as Democratic rival Hillary Clintons lead in the popular vote over Trump has surpassed 2.0 million votes and is expected to grow to more than 2.5 million as ballots in populous states such as California continue to be tallied. Clintons legal team said on Saturday it had agreed to participate in a recount of Wisconsin votes after the states election board approved the effort requested by Green Party candidate Jill Stein, which Trump has called ridiculous. In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally, the Republican Trump tweeted as reporters waited for him to leave his Mar-a-Lago golf resort in Florida to fly back to his residence in New York City. The U.S. presidential race is decided by the Electoral College, based on a tally of wins from the state-by-state contests, rather than by the national vote. Trump has surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. The Electoral College results are expected to be finalized on Dec. 19. Trump takes office on Jan. 20. It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than in the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4 states instead of the 15 states that I visited, Trump added in follow-up tweets. Several hours later, Trump tweeted, again without citing evidence: Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isnt the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem! Clinton won all three states. A spokesman for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Before the election, Trump made unsubstantiated allegations that the results of the election might be rigged against him but several studies have found no evidence of widespread or significant voter fraud in the United States. Since the vote, his message has alternated between appealing for unity and railing against his opponents and the media. In a video message released ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, Trump said he hoped it would be a time for Americans to begin to heal our divisions following a long and bruising political campaign. In a tweet on Saturday, Trump derided the fundraising effort by Stein to launch recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania as a scam that is is now being joined by the badly defeated and demoralized Dems.  Those states had voted Democratic in recent presidential elections but all voted narrowly in favor of the Republican Trump in this months election. The recounts are not expected to change the results of the election. Stein, who won about 1.0 percent of the national vote, has said she wants a recount to guarantee the integrity of the U.S. voting system, a push that came after some computer scientists and election lawyers raised the possibility that hacks could have affected the results. Democratic President Barack Obamas administration has said there is no evidence of electoral tampering, but experts have said that the only way to verify the results are accurate is to conduct a recount.

Trump faces dilemma as U.S. oil reels from record biofuels targets,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Obama administration signed its final plan for renewable fuel use in the United States last week, leaving an oil industry reeling from the most aggressive biofuel targets yet as President-elect Donald Trump takes over. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, signed into law by President George W. Bush, is one of the countrys most controversial energy policies. It requires energy firms to blend ethanol and biodiesel into gasoline and diesel.      The policy was designed to cut greenhouse gas emissions, reduce U.S. reliance on oil imports and boost rural economies that provide the crops for biofuels. It has pitted two of Trumps support bases against each other: Big Oil and Big Corn. The farming sector has lobbied hard for the maximum biofuel volumes laid out in the law to be blended into gasoline motor fuels, while the oil industry argues that the program creates additional costs. Balancing oil and farm interests is likely to prove a challenge for Trump, who has promised to curtail regulations on the oil industry but is already being reminded by biofuels advocates of the importance of the program to the American Midwest, where he received strong support from voters on Nov. 8.     Oil groups are renewing their calls to change or repeal the program following Wednesdays announcement, when the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set record mandates for renewable fuels - for the first time hitting levels targeted by Congress nearly a decade ago.. The EPA plan is completely detached from market realities and confirms once again that Congress must take immediate action to remedy this broken program, said Chet Thompson, President of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, in a statement. It is unclear what Trumps plans for the program will be and his transition team did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Both camps are expecting an administration receptive to their demands, though both have expressed concern and uncertainty over Trumps plans for the program, according to experts, industry and political sources.   The installation of climate change skeptic Myron Ebell as head of the transition at the EPA bolstered oil industry confidence Trump will swing their way. In September, Trump appeared to briefly echo the views of his supporter, billionaire Carl Icahn, who expressed concern about the program. Icahn, who owns a stake in an oil refiner, renewed those criticisms last week, saying the ethanol credit market generated by the program is susceptible to manipulation and harming independent refiners. PRO-ETHANOL CAMPAIGNING The president-elect campaigned on a pro-ethanol platform when he visited Americas farm states and biofuels advocates expect he will keep the RFS strong, maintaining annual targets at the minimum set forth by Congress. Mr. Trump will not turn his back on the American heartland, we believe in him, said Annette Sweeney, a former state representative from Iowa who was a member of the Trumps agricultural advisory committee during his candidacy. To a certain extent, we are on higher ground. You always want to be on higher ground, said Bob Dinneen, head of the Renewable Fuels Association, referring to the increase. Well be able to demonstrate the marketplace can absorb 15 billion gallons of ethanol. We can put this all behind us. As we look to 2018... theres no reason to go back, he said. The renewables industries have already started to emphasize their place among American-made fuels, something experts expect will appeal to Trump. There are a lot of good things to be said about second-generation fuels, even from the new administrations perspective, said Harvard University professor and former Obama administration advisor James Stock. All the new administration needs to do is embrace the original ... vision of the RFS, he said. ",politicsNews,"November 28, 2016 ",1
"Solar, wind industries hope years courting Republicans pays off under Trump","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. wind and solar companies for the first time gave more money to Republicans than Democrats during the 2016 election cycle, according to federal campaign disclosures, part of a years-long effort to expand renewable energys appeal beyond liberal environmentalists. The industry is now hoping its strategy of reaching across the political divide will pay off in the form of Congressional support as Republican Donald Trump, a climate change skeptic who has expressed doubts about the role of clean energy, takes the White House in January. Were not starting from ground zero, said Isaac Brown, a principal at 38 North Solutions, which lobbies on behalf of clean energy clients. The U.S. wind and solar industries employ over 300,000 people, making clean energy an important political constituency that is about five times bigger than the coal sector for jobs, thanks to years of rapid growth fueled by government incentives and declines in the cost of their technologies.  They have also fought to win over a new breed of backer: conservatives skeptical of climate change but interested in supporting homegrown energy alternatives that increase national security, boost competition, and create well-paying blue collar jobs. But Trumps upset victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election has cast doubt on the future of a federal tax break for renewable energy seen critical to the industrys continued growth.  Trump has never specifically called for those credits to end, but has expressed skepticism about the role of solar and wind in the U.S. energy landscape, calling both so expensive and blaming wind turbines for killing birds and ruining picturesque landscapes. During his campaign, Trump also called global warming a hoax and promised to quit a global accord to cut greenhouse gas emissions, though he has since softened his stance and said he is keeping an open mind about the deal. The renewable energy industry got a boost last year when Congress approved a five-year extension of tax credits for new power projects fueled by solar panels and wind turbines, and the industrys main concern in Washington is to ensure they are not withdrawn in Trumps first term, or allowed to expire should he win a second.  A Trump official did not respond to a request for comment about how he will approach renewables as president. But one of Trumps potential picks for Energy Secretary, Oklahoma oil and gas drilling mogul Harold Hamm, has been a vocal opponent of subsidies for renewable energy.  Renewable stocks took a beating immediately after Trumps election but have since mostly recovered. During the 2016 cycle, the wind and solar industrys political action committees contributed more than $225,000 to Republican candidates for office, compared with $185,000 for Democrats. The numbers are not large by the standards of political donations but they mark the first time the industry has tilted its contributions toward Republicans, according to federal records.  In 2012, Democrats got about two-thirds of the industrys contributions. Recipients this year included 34 House Republicans and 19 Senate Republicans. U.S. Senator Dean Heller from Nevada, New York Representative Tom Reed and North Carolina U.S. Senator Richard Burr  all vocal proponents of renewables - together accounted for more than 40 percent of the Solar Energy Industries Association PACs total federal campaign donations. It is reassuring that we have those relationships already developed, and we have a really strong business case for the policies that have been implemented, said Brown of 38 North Solutions. Industry executives like SunPower Chief Executive Tom Werner and First Solar Inc CEO Mark Widmar have acknowledged the uncertainty around federal support for renewables. But they have sought to assuage investors, saying current policies are likely to remain due to the cost-competitiveness of their technologies and the number of jobs they represent. The industry has also tried to get its message out to Trump. The Solar Energy Industries Association, before the election, provided Trump staffers with information about the investment tax credit and its impact on jobs and the economy.  The American Wind Energy Association would not say what interactions it has had with Trumps team, but twice during the campaign it published posts on its blog to counter his statements on the cost of wind energy and its impact on birds. The hope is to partner with and educate new appointees (in Trumps administration) and point out the facts, and then well see, said SunPowers Werner.  Though Democrats have historically been viewed as the strongest supporters of renewable energy, utility-scale wind farms and solar installations are found throughout the nation - including in Republican-leaning states like Arizona, North Carolina, Oklahoma and North Dakota - and enjoy bipartisan support among Americans. A Pew Research Center poll from October found 83 percent of conservative Republicans favor more solar installations, and 75 percent favor more wind farms. Those figures were 97 percent and 93 percent for liberal Democrats.  The expansion of solar beyond liberal strongholds like California and the Northeast has been critical to garnering Republican support over the last few years. The wind industry has been established in red states for far longer than solar and has a longer track record of support from Republican lawmakers in those states.

Cubans fret over life after Castro with Trump next door,"HAVANA (Reuters) - From the Bay of Pigs invasion to a historic visit by President Barack Obama to Havana, Cubans have known for generations that whenever the United States turns its face to Cuba, Fidel Castro would be staring right back. But the death of El Comandante has added to worries among  Cubans that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will slam the door shut on nascent trade and travel ties, undoing two years of detente with the United States under Obama. Many Cubans believe they could do with their late leaders charisma and way with words to counter Trumps bombast. With El Comandante gone, I am a little fearful of what could happen because of Trumps way of thinking and acting,said Yaneisi Lara, a 36-year-old Havana street vendor and flower seller. He could set back and block everything thats been going on, all the things Obama has done. And he did a lot, managing to get the U.S. closer to Cuba, she said, admitting she would consider moving to the United States herself. Trump has struck a very different tone from Obama, who reached an agreement two years ago with Castros younger brother, President Raul Castro, to end half a century of hostilities. Late in his election campaign, Trump sought to reassure  Cuban-American voters in Florida that he was firm in his opposition to the Castros, and pledged that, if elected, he would close down the newly re-opened U.S. embassy in Havana. Earlier on, in the primary contests to pick the Republican presidential nominee, Trump said he thought restoring diplomatic ties with Cuba was fine, but that Obama ought to have cut a better deal. Now that Trump has won the presidency, it is hard to know exactly what his approach to Cuba will be. None of that has been decided, Trumps senior adviser, Kellyanne Conway, said on NBCs Meet the Press on Sunday. The president-elect will make those decisions once he takes office. However, Reince Priebus, who will be Trumps chief of staff when he takes office on Jan. 20, said Trump would call for more political freedoms from the Cuban government, and that if he did not get this he would roll back Obamas opening. There isnt going to be a one-way relationship from the United States to Cuba without some action from the Castro administration, Priebus said on Fox News Sunday. After the death of the 90-year-old Fidel Castro on Friday, Obama called him a singular figure, while Trump described him as a brutal dictator. Castro began his career as a revolutionary by toppling a U.S.-backed government, repelled a CIA-backed counter-revolutionary invasion at the Bay of Pigs in 1961, and faced off against President John F. Kennedy in the Cuban missile crisis a year later. During 49 years in office, he crossed swords with 10 U.S. presidents. And while he took a lower profile after officially retiring in 2008, Castro never stopped warning Cubans that the American government was not to be trusted. Although moving closer to the United States, Raul Castro has not given up much ground to the Obama administration in terms of liberalizing Cubas one-party political system. Obama did not succeed in convincing Congress to lift the United States tough economic embargo on Cuba, but he personally opposed the sanctions and used executive actions to allow more contact and commerce.  The first U.S. commercial flight to Havana in about half a century is due to arrive on Monday. Trump could easily review such measures. He has included Mauricio Claver-Carone, a leading advocate for maintaining a tough economic embargo, in his transition team. Without giving any specifics, Trump said on Saturday that his administration would do all it can once he takes office to help increase freedom and prosperity for Cuban people after the death of Castro. Trump is the polar opposite of Obama, said burly Havana taxi driver Pablo Fernandez Martinez, 39, as he hustled for work.  Life in Cuba remains hard for its educated but underemployed people, but engagement with the United States has brought in more dollars. Martinez fears that could dry up in Trumps administration.   There will probably be less tourist traffic. That will affect everyone in Cuba, and hit the economy, said Martinez, who earns $100-$120 a week driving for foreigners. Pedro Machado, 68, is a retired engineer in marine research who now rents out rooms in his airy apartment near Havanas Malecon seafront. Watching television with his wife, Machado worried that Trumps angry rhetoric could spell trouble. Trumps policies are very aggressive. Well have to see what he actually does. But it certainly looks like bad news for Latin America and for Cuba in particular, he said. My generation benefited from Fidels revolution, in terms of education, the poor were helped. Not everything was a bed of roses, but Fidel helped us, he added The United States has acted as an empire, and thats what Trump represents. Given what he has said, the future is not looking great.

Trump adviser warns him not to pick Romney for Secretary of State,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An internal dispute among Donald Trumps advisers broke out into the open on Sunday when his campaign manager warned that the president-elect could face an intense backlash from supporters if he chose Mitt Romney to be his secretary of state. Trump has been weighing whether to pick Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who spent much of the past year criticizing Trump, or former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, who backed the real-estate moguls insurgent presidential run. Giuliani would fit with the other loyalists and conservative hardliners that Trump has picked to fill out his administration so far, but he has drawn criticism for working as a consultant to foreign governments.  Trump could help unite his party and win over skeptical establishment Republicans if he chooses Romney for the post. Though the debate has largely played out behind closed doors, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway warned that Trump could anger his supporters if he picked Romney, who called him a fraud and a phony in speeches this year. They feel betrayed to think that you can get Romney back in there after everything he did - we dont even know if he voted for Donald Trump. He and his consultants were nothing but awful to Donald Trump for a year, she said on NBCs Meet the Press. I am all for party unity but I am not sure that we have to pay for that with the Secretary of State position, Conway said on CNN. Conway said she would support Trump if he decided to pick Romney for the position, but other Republicans criticized her for making her case on television, rather than talking to Trump directly. Astounding to hear K. Conway, who has the ability to tell Trump privately, trash possibility of Romney as Sec of State publicly, Republican strategist Ana Navarro wrote on Twitter.

Trump says hopes for Cuban 'freedom' after Castro death,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday that his administration would do all it can once he takes office on Jan. 20 to help increase freedom and prosperity for Cuban people after the death of Fidel Castro. But his initial reaction to Castros death sidestepped whether the incoming president would make good on a threat made late in his White House campaign to reverse President Barack Obamas moves to open relations with the Cold War adversary. Obama used his executive powers on a series of steps to ease trade, travel and financial restrictions against Cuba, arguing it was time to try diplomacy after the half-century-long economic embargo againstCuba had failed to shake the regime. Trumps first statement on Cuba policy since the Nov. 8 election, issued from his Palm Beach, Florida, resort where he and his family were spending the weekend after the Thanksgiving holiday, did not address whether he would roll back Obamas measures because of concerns about religious and political freedom in Cuba. Though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey towardprosperity and liberty, Trump said in the statement.  While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and towarda future in which the wonderful Cuban peoplefinally live in the freedom they so richly deserve, he said. Trump has just begun to fill out the top ranks of his national security team, and has not yet named his top diplomat - the secretary of state - who will play a major role in formulating policy on Cuba. He last week named Mauricio Claver-Carone, a political lobbyist who has strongly criticized Obamas efforts to normalize relations with Cuba and supports maintaining the U.S. embargo against the island, to his transition team at the U.S. Treasury Department. The agency is responsible for enforcing U.S. trade and travel restrictions on Cuba. Claver-Carone is director of the U.S.-Cuba Democracy Political Action Committee. Claver-Carone was not immediately available for comment on Saturday. Trumps initial statement was viewed by some to mark a softening from his rhetoric on Cuba policy late in the campaign, one U.S. intelligence official told Reuters, speaking on the condition of anonymity. This may be one place where his business interests prod him to take a more pragmatic course, even if that angers the hard-core, anti-Castro elements of both parties, the official told Reuters. A second U.S. official noted the foreign policy advisers Trump has named thus far are not known to have any particular interest in Cuba. That may mean Trumps economic team will have more sway over Cuba policy, which could lead to a more pragmatic approach, the second official said. An aggressive policy by Trump would close off lucrative opportunities to U.S. businesses and hand them to European or Asian firms, and would hurt companies like American Airlines (AAL.O), due to start commercial flights to Havana on Monday for the first time in half a century. Trump - a New York businessman and former reality TV star with an unconventional approach to politics - started his campaign saying he was open to lifting the long-standing embargo on trade with Cuba. In January, he said on Fox News that he was in favor of opening it up with Cuba, but wanted a better deal than Obama had made, comments he repeated in a debate with Republican rivals in March. I would want to make a strong, solid, good deal because right now, everything is in Cubas favor, Trump said in March, saying he would probably have the embassy closed in Havana until a new deal was made. When Obama visited Cuba later that month, Trump said in an interview with CNN that he probably would continue to normalize economic and diplomatic relations with Cuba, and would even open a Trump hotel in Cuba if the conditions were right. I think Cuba has certain potential, and I think its OK to bring Cuba into the fold, but you have to make a much better deal, he said, noting he was worried Cuba would sue the United States for reparations for damage caused by its decades-long embargo on Cuba. Cuba policy was not part of a major foreign policy address Trump delivered in April. After he secured his partys nomination, his position shifted to a more traditional Republican position. At a Miami rally in September, Trump said he would roll back Obamas Cuban policy reforms unless Cuban leaders allowed religious freedom and freed political prisoners. The next president can reverse them, and that I will do unless the Castro regime meets our demands, Trump told supporters. His vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, also took a hard line. Let me make you a promise, Pence said in Miami just days before the election. When Donald Trump is president of the United States, we will repeal Obamas executive orders on Cuba. On Saturday, Pence tweeted: The tyrant Castro is dead. New hope dawns. We will stand with the oppressed Cuban people for a free and democratic Cuba. Viva Cuba Libre! Trump will face pressure to reverse Obamas orders on Cuba from a bloc of mostly Republican Cuban-American lawmakers that has worked to keep tight restrictions on trade and travel with Cuba for years. They believe Cubas government is still too repressive to ease economic and travel restrictions. The dictator has died, but the dictatorship has not, said U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Cuban-American who ran against Trump to be the Republican presidential candidate. The future of Cuba ultimately remains in the hands of the Cuban people, and now more than ever Congress and the new administration must stand with them against their brutal rulers and support their struggle for freedom and basic human rights. But some Republicans want to continue with Obamas opening. U.S. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a leading Republican anti-embargo voice, said on Saturday that more frequent and consequential ties between Cubans and Americans would more likely boost income and sap the strength of the Castro government. Democratic Congresswoman Kathy Castor, who represents a Tampa, Florida, district with a significant Cuban population, said she thinks Castros death could make it easier for the Trump administration to change its Cuba stance. While Fidel Castro was alive, there was an emotional impediment for greater engagement from the Cuban exile community in Miami, Castor told Reuters. That emotional impediment now is gone, she said.

Sanders to Trump: use defense contracts as leverage for Carrier jobs,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders turned up the pressure on President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday about his pledge to try to stop an Indiana air conditioner manufacturer from moving 1,400 jobs to Mexico. Both Sanders, who challenged Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, and Trump seized on an announcement earlier this year by United Technologies Corps Carrier division that it would shift production to Mexico as an example of how trade deals hurt U.S. workers. Sanders on Saturday warned it is not good enough to save some of these jobs and said Trump should use as leverage United Technologies defense contracts, Export-Import Bank financing, and tax breaks. I call on Mr. Trump to make it clear to the CEO of United Technologies that if his firmwants to receive another defense contract from the taxpayers of this country, it must not move these plants to Mexico, the senator from Vermont said in a statement. A representative for Carrier declined to comment on Sanders statement. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, said on Thursday that he was working hard, even on Thanksgiving to get the plant to stay and said he was making progress on the issue. Carrier Corp. confirmed it had discussions with the incoming administration. Neither side has provided details. Trump had threatened to slap taxes on the companys air conditioners made in Mexico and shipped back to the United States. A spokesman was not immediately available for comment on Sanders statement on Saturday. Sanders said he would soon introduce legislation that would prevent companies that outsource from receiving federal contracts, grants and loans, and force companies that outsource jobs to pay a penalty tax and pay back tax breaks.

"Clinton team to take part in U.S. state vote recount, Trump blasts effort","WASHINGTON/WEST PAlM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clintons campaign will take part in a recount of Wisconsin votes in the U.S. presidential race, an effort Republican winner Donald Trump called ridiculous on Saturday. Wisconsins election board on Friday approved the recount requested by Green Party candidate Jill Stein. She has said she wants to guarantee the integrity of the U.S. voting system since computer hacking had marked the Nov. 8 election. Marc Elias, the Clinton campaign counsel, said the campaign would take part in the recount in Wisconsin as well as in the other battleground states of Pennsylvania and Michigan if recounts were mounted there. Elias said in a statement on the Medium website that the Clinton campaign had not planned to seek a recount since its own investigation had failed to turn up any sign of hacking of voting systems. But now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides, Elias said.  Clintons campaign should be legally represented in  Wisconsin to be able to monitor the recount, he said.  In a statement, Trump said the three states had been won by wide margins, including by more than 70,000 votes in Pennsylvania. The recount is a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already been conceded, he said. The $7 million Stein has sought to raise for the recounts is a way to fill her coffers with money, most of which she will never even spend on this ridiculous recount, he said.  Although Trump won the Electoral College tally, Clinton will have won the national popular vote by more than 2 million ballots when the final results are in. Stein has raised $5.8 million of the $7 million needed to cover fees and legal costs for the three recounts, according to her campaign website. The deadline for filing a recount bid in Pennsylvania is Monday. The voting margins make it highly unlikely any recounts would end up giving Clinton a win in all three states, which would be needed for the overall election result to change. Trump beat Clinton in Pennsylvania by 70,010 votes, in Michigan by 10,704 votes and in Wisconsin by 27,257 votes. Experts urged extra scrutiny of the three states, Stein told CNN on Friday, because their voting systems were seen as vulnerable. ",politicsNews,"November 26, 2016 ",1

This is a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already been conceded, and the results of this electionshould be respected instead of being challenged and abused, which is exactly what (Green Party leader) Jill Stein is doing, Trump said in a statement about the recount.

"Trump turns to Washington lawyer to navigate legal, ethics issues","WEST PALM BEACH, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump on Friday chose Washington insider Donald McGahn to be his White House counsel, giving him the job of untangling potential conflicts of interest that the New York businessmans presidency may present. McGahn, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, had been the chief counsel of the Trump campaign and was one of the few members of the Republican establishment to embrace the outsider candidate. While Trump during his campaign frequently promised to drain the swamp of the political establishment in Washington, McGahn has an extensive history in the capital, especially in conservative politics. McGahn served for years as counsel to the National Republican Congressional Committee, the arm of the Republican Party that oversees campaigns for the U.S. House of Representatives.  During his time at the FEC, McGahn was an advocate for loosening restrictions on campaign spending and was widely praised for opening up more of the commissions internal processes to the public. Along with providing guidance on ethics issues, the White House Counsels office advises the president on the legality of proposed executive orders and legislation passed by Congress and vets potential administration appointees, including Supreme Court justices.  Don has a brilliant legal mind, excellent character and a deep understanding of constitutional law, Trump said in a statement.  Trump, a businessman who has never held public office, has real estate and leisure holdings all over the world, sparking concerns that his investments could color his decision-making in office. Trump has said that he will hand over day-to-day responsibilities of running his company to his children, but he has resisted calls to place his assets in a blind trust. Trump also has expressed interest in finding a way to bypass a federal anti-nepotism law in order to give his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a formal White House role.  When Trump met with President Barack Obama earlier this month, Obama advised Trump during their Oval Office chat that his White House counsel would be an important job. Trump has vowed to reverse Obamas executive orders in a number of areas, including immigration and gun control. He also must nominate someone to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. McGahn will be tasked with shepherding the nominee through confirmation hearings. Trump, who is spending the Thanksgiving holiday weekend at his home in Palm Beach, Florida, also continued to round out his national security team on Friday, naming Kathleen Troia K.T. McFarland, as his deputy national security adviser.  McFarland served in three Republican administrations and was an aide to Henry Kissinger in the 1970s. A strong backer of Trump during the election campaign, McFarland will work with Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, Trumps pick as his national security adviser. Neither position requires confirmation by the U.S Senate. The appointments came amid reports that Trumps aides are divided about his choice for secretary of state, with some preferring 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who harshly criticized Trump during the campaign, and others backing Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor. Transition officials on Friday downplayed any internal tension, calling reports of discord overblown.  Officials said that after returning to New York, Trump will meet with several more potential cabinet picks on Monday, including John Allison, the former chief executive of BB&T Corp who has been mentioned as a possible choice for U.S. Treasury secretary, and Paul Atkins, a former commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Wisconsin agrees to statewide recount in presidential race,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wisconsins election board agreed on Friday to conduct a statewide recount of votes cast in the presidential race, as requested by a Green Party candidate seeking similar reviews in two other states where Donald Trump scored narrow wins. The recount process, including an examination by hand of the nearly 3 million ballots tabulated in Wisconsin, is expected to begin late next week after Green Party candidate Jill Steins campaign has paid the required fee, the Elections Commission said. The state faces a Dec. 13 federal deadline to complete the recount, which may require canvassers in Wisconsins 72 counties to work evenings and weekends to finish the job in time, according to the commission. The recount fee has yet to be determined, the agency said in a statement on its website. Stein said in a Facebook message on Friday that the sum was expected to run to about $1.1 million. She said she has raised at least $5 million from donors since launching her drive on Wednesday for recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania - three battleground states where Republican Trump edged out Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by relatively thin margins. Stein has said her goal is to raise $7 million to cover all fees and legal costs. Her effort may have given a ray of hope to dispirited Clinton supporters, but the chance of overturning the overall result of the Nov. 8 election is considered very slim, even if all three states go along with the recount. The Green Party candidate, who garnered little more than 1 percent of the nationwide popular vote herself, said on Friday that she was seeking to verify the integrity of the U.S. voting system, not to undo Trumps victory. While there was no evidence of tampering or voting errors in the election, only a thorough review of results from the three states at issue will reassure Americans, Stein said. This was a hack-riddled election, she told CNN, pointing to various cyber-attacks on political organizations and individual email accounts before Election Day and media reports citing concerns raised by computer security specialists. Experts urged extra scrutiny of the three states, Stein said, because their voting systems were seen as vulnerable. They also cited unexplained high numbers of undervotes, the close finish between the two nominees and discrepancies between pre-election polling and the official result, she said. According to Stein, the Wisconsin commission confirmed receipt of her recount petition at 3:45 p.m. local time, just over an hour before the deadline for filing. The filing deadline is Monday in Pennsylvania and Wednesday in Michigan. The Wisconsin board said Stein was joined in her petition by another third-party candidate, Rocky Roque De La Fuente. Although Trump won narrowly in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the margins make it highly unlikely any recounts would end up giving Clinton a win in all three states, which would be needed for the overall election result to change. Trump beat Clinton in Pennsylvania by 70,010 votes, in Michigan by 10,704 votes and in Wisconsin by 27,257 votes. The presidential race is decided by the Electoral College, based on a tally of wins from the state-by-state contests, rather than by the popular national vote. The Electoral College results are expected to be finalized on Dec. 19. Trump surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed to win, although Clinton will have won the national popular vote by more than 2 million ballots once final tallies are in. A representative for Trumps transition team on Thursday had no comment on Steins effort, and Clinton has not commented on Steins effort. ",politicsNews,"November 25, 2016 ",1

"Mexicans very negative on Trump, but back talks with him: poll","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - An overwhelming majority of Mexicans hold a negative view of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, but most believe their own president should meet with him to defend the countrys interests, an opinion poll showed on Friday. The survey by polling firm Buendia & Laredo for newspaper El Universal showed that 74 percent of respondents had a negative opinion of Trump, a Republican. Only 5 percent had a positive view of him. Trump, who launched a string of verbal attacks on Mexico during the campaign, has vowed to build a wall along the U.S. southern border, carry out mass deportations of illegal immigrants and has threatened to ditch a trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. President Enrique Pena Nieto sparked widespread anger by inviting Trump to Mexico City for talks at the end of August. A parallel survey by the same pollster published at the weekend showed that nearly two-thirds of Mexicans believed the invitation was a mistake. Still, now that Trump has been elected president, 53 percent of Mexicans said Pena Nieto should meet the New Yorker to promote the countrys interests with the United States, the poll showed. Some 43 percent of those surveyed took the opposite view. Fully 52 percent of the respondents said they held a positive opinion of Trumps defeated Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, with only 7 percent of the opposite view. The poll of 1,000 Mexicans was conducted between Nov. 11 and 15, and had a margin of error of 3.5 percent. ",politicsNews,"November 25, 2016 ",1

"Blue-collar Democrats to party: It's still the economy, stupid","(Reuters) - David Betras could see trouble coming. The Democratic Party chairman in Youngstown, Ohio, wrote to Hillary Clintons advisers in May warning she needed to put a jobs-focused message at the heart of her White House campaign or else watch blue-collar voters in states like Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania slip away to Republican Donald Trump. Clinton never responded to Betras, and in the final weeks of her campaign she spent much of her time portraying Trump as unfit, rather than highlighting her economic plans. On Nov. 8, Election Day, Betras warning proved prescient - she lost Ohio and Pennsylvania and, on Wednesday, Michigan, too, based on the latest unofficial ballot counts. The surprising upset by Trump, a wealthy businessman who made his promises to renegotiate trade deals and restore jobs a centerpiece of his agenda, was fueled in part by support from white working-class voters in those vital Rust Belt states and elsewhere. After the disastrous election losses at the state and national level, Betras and other Rust Belt Democrats who have found success in blue-collar districts have some advice for their anxious party: the key to recapturing those voters is not a broad change in policy, but a new commitment to listen and act on their economic concerns, and to show Democrats care. You can have all the great ideas on Earth, but if they dont think you are on their side they arent going to listen to you, said U.S. Representative Dan Kildee, of Flint, Michigan, one of a small cadre of Democrats in Congress who have learned how to win in working-class districts by emphasizing economic solutions. Democratic U.S. Representative Matt Cartwright, whose district around Scranton, Pennsylvania, was one of the presidential campaigns prime battlegrounds, also won re-election to a third term with about 54 percent of the vote. About 40,000 Trump voters crossed over to back him, he said in an interview. Why would they pick me and not also Hillary Clinton? It comes down to credibility, he said. I know the pain out there. When I talk to voters, jobs is always my No. 1 message, and I tell them exactly what Im doing to get more jobs back to the district. Recalling the 1992 presidential campaign theme of Clintons husband, Bill Clinton, Cartwright added: Its the economy, stupid. These folks are working harder and harder to try and stay in the same place. The partys efforts to regain lost ground with blue-collar voters could be a factor in next weeks election for Democratic leader in the House of Representatives. Tim Ryan, whose northeast Ohio district encompasses blue-collar Youngstown, is challenging veteran leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco. Ryan has emphasized his ability to talk to working class voters and said in announcing his leadership run that people need to know we understand that they elected us to fight for economic opportunity for all. Kildee, who was re-elected to a third term with 61 percent of the vote, said Democrats seeking lessons in the election rubble should not overreact and begin moderating their positions on social issues or shifting their stances to target elements of the partys base of support. From decimated industrial towns to inner cities or the rural plains, voters share a similar anxiety about an economic system that seems to have left them behind, he said.   Everybody is talking about the same thing, and its economic uncertainty - its the fear of not having a job, or their kids not getting a job, or not having a retirement, Kildee said. If we arent talking about jobs and the economy first, no one is listening when you talk about other issues. GOLD-PLATED TOILETS By tapping into those economic worries, Trump captured about two-thirds of whites with no college degree, exit polls showed. That helped him gain the razor-thin margin of victory he needed in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan - all picked up by President Barack Obama in 2012 - to win the Electoral College, despite losing the popular vote. In contrast to Trump, whose rallies were a call to arms against an economic system rigged against everyday Americans, Clinton mentioned but rarely highlighted the many aspects of her economic agenda during the final weeks of the campaign. We were so off message that a billionaire with gold-plated toilets was the guy who was breaking through and talking to blue-collar families, said Betras, party chairman in Ohios heavily Democratic Mahoning County, where Trump captured 47 percent of the vote, 12 percentage points better than Republican Mitt Romney in 2012. Betras said many blue-collar workers increasingly felt forgotten by the national party, which at times seemed more focused on social and cultural issues than on bread-and-butter economic concerns. The Democratic National Committee did not respond to questions about the partys efforts to win working-class voters. Betras had urged Clinton in his memo to spend more time talking about ways to entice companies to repatriate manufacturing jobs, or her plans to create jobs through boosting infrastructure programs - both key elements of Trumps stump speech. Both candidates made frequent visits to Pennsylvania and Ohio. But after the party conventions in July Clinton only traveled to Michigan four times, twice in the last week of the campaign, and never visited Wisconsin. Trump hit both a half-dozen times. David Murray, a registered independent who lives just outside Flint, Michigan, said he voted to re-elect Kildee and backed Obama in 2008 and 2012, but cast his presidential ballot for Trump this time. I didnt feel like Clinton really cared about us, said Murray, a personal service industry worker. We are still hurting here. I feel as if we havent recovered from the economic free fall. Clinton seemed like just another four years of what Obama has done for my area, which is four years of nothing. Obama appeared to echo the concerns of Betras and the two lawmakers in recent comments on the Democratic post-election hand-wringing.  The key for us  when I say us, I mean Americans, but I think particularly for progressives  is to say your concerns are real, your anxieties are real, heres how we fix them, Obama said. Trump consistently outperformed Romneys 2012 totals in areas with heavy concentrations of working-class whites. In Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, partially in Cartwrights district, Trump won 58 percent of the vote compared to Romneys 47 percent. In neighboring Lackawana County, Trump won 47 percent of the vote compared to Romneys 36 percent. Sharon Taboada, a juvenile probation officer in Houghton Lake, Michigan, with two sons in college, said she voted for Trump in part because of his economic message. Clinton talked very little about our economy and I feel she was way out of touch with the working force, she said. ",politicsNews,"November 25, 2016 ",1

Trump's shifting positions since U.S. election win,"(Reuters) - After firing up crowds with boisterous and sometimes divisive campaign rhetoric, Donald Trump has appeared to moderate some stances since he won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. Such shifts have cheered critics concerned about his campaign positions while angering some supporters. But Trump  also sometimes modified positions during the campaign, so the Republican president-elect could change stances again before or after he takes office on Jan. 20. The following are some of his changing positions: To chants from crowds of Lock her up, Trump said during the campaign that if he won the election, his administration would prosecute his Democratic rival over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, and over what he said were abuses of her position with regard to her familys charitable foundation. During the second presidential debate on Oct. 9, he said he would appoint a special prosecutor and seek to jail Clinton if he won. Asked during a New York Times interview on Nov. 22 about reports that he no longer wanted to prosecute Clinton, Trump said, I want to move forward, I dont want to move back. And I dont want to hurt the Clintons. I really dont. However, he said no when asked if he was definitively taking the idea of investigating Clinton off the table.  Trump has called global warming a hoax and during the campaign he said he wanted to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris Agreement among almost 200 nations, which came into effect on Nov. 4. Instead, he said he would push ahead and develop cheap coal, shale and oil. On Nov. 12, a source on his transition team said Trumps advisers were considering ways to bypass a theoretical four-year procedure for leaving the climate accord. Asked in the Times interview on Nov. 22 if he was going to take America out of the worlds lead of confronting climate change, Trump said, I have an open mind to it. Were going to look very carefully. Asked if he believed human activity causes climate change, he said, I think there is some connectivity. There is some, something. It depends on how much. During the campaign, Trump said he would repeal President Barack Obamas signature Affordable Care Act. He called Obamacare a disaster and said he would replace it with a plan that would give states more control over the Medicaid health plan for the poor and allow insurers to sell plans nationally. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Nov. 11, Trump said he was considering keeping parts of the law, including provisions letting parents keep adult children up to age 26 on insurance policies and barring insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. Either Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced, Trump told the Journal. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly promised to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border to curb illegal immigration and that Mexico would pay for it. He also said he would deport millions of illegal immigrants and proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country as a means of countering terrorism. He never retracted this but in the later stages of the campaign, rephrased it as a proposal to temporarily suspend immigration from regions deemed as exporting terrorism and where safe vetting cannot be ensured. In an interview with CBS program 60 Minutes that aired on Nov. 13, Trump said he really planned to build a wall. However, asked if this could be a fence, he said it could be part wall, part fence. For certain areas I would (have a fence) but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. Im very good at this - its called construction, he said. Asked about deporting illegal immigrants, he told CBS that the initial focus would be on those immigrants who are criminal and have criminal records, who he said probably numbered 2 million and possibly even 3 million. During the campaign, Trump said the United States should revive use of waterboarding and a lot more when questioning terrorism suspects. Waterboarding, an interrogation tactic that simulates drowning, is widely regarded as torture and was banned under President Barack Obama. In the Nov. 22 Times interview, Trump said he had been impressed when he asked Marine General James Mattis, a potential pick for defense secretary, about waterboarding and Mattis replied, Ive always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture. While the response had not made him change his mind, Trump said, it had impressed him that the use of waterboarding was not going to make the kind of a difference that maybe a lot of people think.

"More company climate votes ahead, as Trump may loosen energy rules","BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist shareholders plan a record number of resolutions focused on climate change at U.S. company annual meetings in 2017, even as President-elect Donald Trump looks set to loosen environmental regulations. Based on filings so far, U.S. companies are on track to face roughly 200 resolutions on climate matters at their shareholder meetings next year, according to Rob Berridge, who follows the subject for Ceres, a sustainability advocacy group.  There were 174 such resolutions this year, Berridge said, compared with 167 in 2015 and 148 in 2014. Many have been directed at big oil and gas companies, though other sectors have also been targeted, including technology and retail. Activist shareholders broadly aim to curb companies carbon emissions and make energy usage more efficient, or at the very least, to draw the attention of companies and investors to climate change as an urgent problem.  They have had some limited success. Investors at Exxon Mobil Corp the worlds largest publicly traded oil producer, passed a measure this year that could lead to an environmental activist joining its board. Our position is that the risk of climate change is clear and warrants action, said Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers. The rising number of shareholder votes reflects a growing concern among big investors about the environment, encouraged by steps by some boards to embrace reforms.  Deadlines are fast approaching to get resolutions on the ballot for shareholder meetings to be held in the spring. The election victory of Trump, who is set to take over as U.S. president on Jan. 20, only seems to have added impetus.  On the campaign trail, Trump dismissed human-caused climate change as a hoax and pledged to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency. He also threatened to withdraw the United States from the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement to combat climate change, although he appeared to step back from that position on Tuesday. He vowed instead to revive the U.S. coal industry, encourage oil drilling and to scale back regulation of the energy sector.  Despite what the administration may or may not do, I really believe that corporations understand the risks posed by climate change, said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a  California nonprofit campaign group. It sponsored 18 climate-related shareholder resolutions in 2016 and expects to file a bigger number next year. One resolution for 2017 calls on Anadarko Petroleum Corp to report on how it would address the risk of so-called stranded assets, such as high-cost deepwater project investments, that might be caused by a drop in demand for oil and gas. The idea won support from 42 percent of shares voted at the companys 2016 meeting, up from 29 percent in 2015. Anadarkos board last year called the idea unnecessary and unproductive. Spokesman John Christiansen said it is reviewing the proposal. To be sure, among S&P 500 companies, investor support for climate resolutions has been relatively weak, holding steady around 22 percent since 2014, according to research firm Fund Votes.  But activists often won more backing for ideas such as urging companies to report on their strategy for dealing with climate change, according to the Sustainable Investments Institute, a research firm specializing in shareholder votes, supported by universities, pension funds and other institutional investors.  Anne Simpson, director of sustainability for the California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), which manages about $300 billion, said it plans to file or back resolutions at U.S. oil and gas companies for 2017, though she declined to discuss specifics.  Last year the boards of mining companies including Rio Tinto Plc and Glencore Plc endorsed resolutions Calpers submitted calling for reports on climate risk, and the measures passed by wide margins.  More companies will likely embrace shareholder proposals to head off disruption caused by climate change, Simpson said. Economics is driving this, not politics, she said.

Trump will pursue 'regional hegemony' in South China Sea: Chinese academics,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A Donald Trump presidency does not mean the United States will withdraw from the South China Sea, but rather will continue pursuing regional hegemony, Chinese academics who drafted a report for an influential government think tank said on Friday. Ensuring absolute control over the South China Sea was the crux of U.S. military strategy in the Asia-Pacific, according to what the authors said was Chinas first ever public report on the U.S. military presence in the region, released on Friday in Beijing. There will be no overturning change to U.S. policy in the South China Sea, said Wu Shicun, head of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, an influential Hainan-based think tank that wrote the report. Trump rarely mentioned the South China Sea on the campaign trail, but concentrated on the economic relationship with Beijing, threatening to label China a currency manipulator and impose import tariffs on Chinese imports. U.S. commitments to its allies would not change, nor would its stance on protecting freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, said Wu. As such, tensions between China and the United States in the South China Sea would likely grow in lock-step with Chinas military growth, he added. China claims most of the energy-rich waters through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year. Neighbors Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims. Recent U.S. efforts to counter what it sees as China limiting freedom of navigation in the South China Sea have drawn Beijings ire and stoked fears of military conflict. A patrol by U.S. warships in October was dubbed illegal and provocative by the Chinese Defence Ministry. From the U.S. perspective, Chinas large-scale construction activities in the South China Sea confirmed U.S. suspicion that China intended to implement an anti-access/area-denial strategy, the report said. There would be more continuity than change in Trumps military policy in the Asia-Pacific, said Zhu Feng, director of the South China Sea Center at Nanjing University, at the report launch. Trump may not use the term rebalancing to the region, but he would likely retain most of policies, he added. Both academics agreed that there was a high possibility of increased U.S. military spending in the Asia-Pacific under Trump. A Trump administration would not be an exception to other Republican-led governments that increase military spending when they take office, said Zhu Feng. The build-up of military might in the region has led to worries of a rising risk of accidental collisions that could spark conflict. Zhu said that the decision to release a public report now was not China preparing for war but rather to avoid an arms race between China and the United States. ",politicsNews,"November 25, 2016 ",1
Trump keeps politics on his Thanksgiving menu,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump spent the Thanksgiving holiday at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Thursday, dining with his family at the Florida golf club after revisiting a campaign pledge he made about restoring American manufacturing. Trump, known for his use of Twitter to drive political debate, tweeted about an Indiana air conditioner maker he featured in his election campaign as an emblem of trade deals he said were unfavorable to American workers. Trump, who has not been seen in public since arriving in Florida on Tuesday, said he was working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon! Carrier Corp, a division of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), responded on Twitter that the company has had discussions with the incoming administration but had nothing to announce at this time. A representative for the company had no additional comment. Earlier this year, the company said it would move 1,400 jobs to Mexico from Indiana, giving a three-year timetable for the shift. The states Republican governor, Mike Pence - later picked by Trump as his vice-presidential running mate - decried the decision, and spoke out against it often on the campaign trail. Trump made Carriers decision part of his rallying cry against the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. He said he would slap taxes on the companys air conditioners shipped back to the United States. Asked by Reuters last week whether the company was reconsidering its decision given Trumps victory in the Nov. 8 election over Democrat Hillary Clinton, the company said in a statement it was making every effort to help its Indiana employees during the shift. By providing three years advance notice of the move and by funding education and retraining programs for up to four years after the move is complete, we are providing employees with both time and opportunity to help them to make a smooth transition, the company said. Carrier also cited an agreement it had reached with the United Steelworkers union about compensation for affected workers. Trumps Thanksgiving comments on Carrier were reminiscent of remarks he tweeted last week about Ford Motor Co (F.N), a company he criticized during the campaign for shifting some production lines to Mexico. When Ford informed Trump it would not shift production of a Lincoln sport utility vehicle to Mexico from Kentucky, he took to Twitter to say he saved the plant, although the company had never considered moving the whole factory south of the border. I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky, Trump tweeted, referring to Fords executive chairman. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has been interviewing candidates for his Cabinet and other top White House positions. He and Pence have held more than 60 such meetings since the election. He did not announce any new decisions on Thursday. A spokeswoman said he was spending the evening with family members. They recognize how precious this kind of time is, and look forward to an evening together to celebrate and count their many blessings, the spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said. They dined in the Mar-a-Lago club, where the menu included a choice of four chilled seafoods, Mr. Trumps Wedge Salad, devilled eggs, traditional turkey and stuffing, lamb, beef and sea bass. Among the eight desserts: Three Layer Trump Chocolate Cake. Trump announced two picks on Wednesday for his Cabinet - South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and wealthy Republican donor and school choice advocate Betsy DeVos to lead the Education Department. Both are subject to Senate confirmation. Major choices for the Pentagon, State Department and Treasury are still to come. Trumps State Department deliberations have spurred debate within his inner circle - particularly his consideration of Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and businessman who ran against Democratic President Barack Obama in the 2012 election. Romney would be a comforting pick for establishment Republicans. But hardline Trump backers believe he should be disqualified because he called Trump a fraud during the Republican nominating race and urged Republicans to stop him from becoming their candidate for the 2016 election. Kellyanne Conway, Trumps senior adviser, said on Thursday she was on the receiving end of a deluge of social media & private comms about the Romney option, noting being loyal was a positive attribute for the job. Trump and Pence were spending significant time on the secretary of state pick, spokesman Jason Miller told reporters before the Thanksgiving break. Theyll be looking for things like chemistry, experience, a similar vision into what the president-elect and vice president elect are trying to do with this administration, Miller said.

U.N. envoy sees continued U.S. work to end Syria war,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The U.N. Special Envoy for Syria on Thursday said U.S. President Barack Obama could well keep working until his last day in office to end the war in Syria, and Russia did not want to be held responsible for the demolition of eastern Aleppo. I would never underestimate an outgoing U.S. president as a lame duck, Staffan de Mistura said in an interview published on Friday in Germanys Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. President Obama .... and Secretary of State John Kerry are very motivated to end the greatest humanitarian tragedy of this century that has played out during their time in office. Its about their legacy, de Mistura said. De Mistura on Tuesday had expressed concern that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad could launch a brutal new offensive to crush rebel-held eastern Aleppo before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. He said his recent meetings in Damascus showed the Syrian regime had been emboldened by Trumps comments during the campaign about ending support for the Syrian opposition. But he said he reminded Syrian leaders that any U.S. president would face massive public pressure if the situation ended as a human tragedy with 200,000 people starving. De Mistura said he feared eastern Aleppo could be decimated by Christmas if the bombardment continued, which would spur tens of thousands of refugees to flee to Turkey, and could lead to a prolonged guerilla war in rural areas and car bombs in cities. The head of the Syria White Helmets volunteer group on Thursday said besieged residents of Aleppo were about ten days from starvation. The U.N. envoy said he believed Russias claim that it was not bombing any targets in eastern Aleppo, but added that Moscow was also not stopping Syrian forces from attacking hospitals or other targets in the city. Still, he said he believed Russia was serious about not wanting to take responsibility for the destruction of eastern Aleppo. He said it was simply not in the interest of Russia or the Syrian government to be left with a completely destroyed country, five or six years of a mini-Afghanistan, and a type of guerrilla war in the rural areas.

"In India's Punjab, Haley relatives cheer appointment as UN envoy","NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Nikki Haley may have been born in the United States but her extended family back in India is thrilled that the South Carolina governor has been named by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump as ambassador to the United Nations. Haleys parents hail from rural Punjab, in northwestern India. They moved to Amritsar - home to the Golden Temple that is the most holy place of the Sikh religion - before emigrating to North America in the early 1960s. Haley, 44, was born Nimrata Randhawa in Bamberg, South Carolina - she was called Nikki as a child and took the family name of husband Michael when they married in Sikh and Methodist ceremonies in 1996. Kanwaljit Singh Randhawa, a 70-year-old cousin, told Reuters family and friends were delighted by Haleys appointment and said it could help improve relations between the United States and India. It is a great achievement for Punjab and India. We are proud of the fact that (Nikki) has achieved this success, Randhawa told Reuters by telephone. Randhawa, a retired lecturer, said he was in regular touch with Nikkis father, Ajit Singh Randhawa, who grew up in the village of Pandori Ran Singh, south of Amritsar. Indias foreign ministry said it was happy to hear news of Haleys appointment, describing her as a supporter of closer U.S.-India ties who had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he visited Washington in June. We know Governor Haley very well, said spokesman Vikas Swarup. Indias foreign secretary visited the United States earlier this month and interacted with very senior levels of the Trump transition team, he also said. Haley came only once to India as a four-year-old child, doesnt speak Punjabi and has converted to Christianity. But she has visited India more recently in an official capacity, going to Amritsar in November 2014 on what she called an emotional and very personal day. I always yearned to see Punjab - my motherland - and now I am so proud to be here after almost 40 years, she told TV reporters at the time, her voice choking with emotion as she steadied herself with nips from a water bottle. Her biography is similar to that of Richard Verma, the first U.S. ambassador to New Delhi of Indian origin. He was born in the United States into a Punjabi family but visited often as a child. Verma was mobbed by relatives and locals when he visited his ancestral home in early 2015. Haley has little foreign policy experience, while Trump has expressed favorable views toward India, where he has real estate interests. The tycoon-turned-TV reality star told one cultural event put on by diaspora Republicans during the presidential campaign that he loved the country and its people. Trumps stated intention of banning immigration by Muslims from countries that are a source of Islamist militancy has played well with many in India, a majority Hindu nation that has long been at odds with Muslim-majority Pakistan. Much of the diplomacy over the rivalry between India and Pakistan, both nuclear-armed powers, plays out in the corridors of UN headquarters in New York and Haleys appointment is likely to be seen positively in New Delhi in that light. India, the worlds largest democracy, is also lobbying to be made a permanent member of an expanded UN Security Council, although its doubtful this would be a priority for Trump. Back in Punjab, relatives and old family friends are planning a major celebration to mark the elevation of Haley to the top diplomatic post.  We are going to the Golden Temple in Amritsar to pray for her success, said Randhawa. And we will speak to our friends and villagers to have a function in the next few days.

Green Party raises $3.5 million for presidential vote recounts,"MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein said on Thursday she has raised $3.5 million to force recounts of the Nov. 8 election results in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, three states where Donald Trump scored narrow wins.  The campaign said it exceeded its initial goal for raising $2.5 million and has enough money to pay Wisconsins $1.1 million filing fee due on Friday. At the same time, the party said it raised its target to $4.5 million, with filing deadlines approaching in Pennsylvania on Monday and Michigan on Wednesday. Stein is pushing for recounts because experts pointed to statistical anomalies in the tallies in all three battleground states, according to the partys website.  Trump, a Republican who ran as an anti-establishment maverick, carried all three states by narrow margins despite public opinion polls pointing to victories by Hillary Clinton, the Democratic standard-bearer. We deserve elections we can trust, the campaign said, adding that the effort was not intended to help Clinton. A representative of the president-elects transition team could not be reached for comment. But Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser, suggested that efforts to force recounts were ironic, given harsh criticism of Trump before the election when he would not say whether he would accept the result of what he called a rigged political system. Look who cant accept the election results, Conway said in a Twitter message, pointing to a headline in the New York Times that read Hillary Clinton Supporters Call for Vote Recount in Battleground States. Although Clinton won more votes than Trump on a nationwide basis, the real estate developer exceeded the number of votes in the Electoral College needed to take the presidency. Electoral votes are apportioned state by state, mostly on a winner-take-all basis.  Stein took a little more than 1 percent of the popular vote, while Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson came in third place behind Trump and Clinton.  Steins website said that the total cost of recounts in the three states was $6 million to $7 million, but it did not explain why the campaigns new target was only $4.5 million.

Germany's Seehofer invites Trump to Bavaria: source,"MUNICH (Reuters) - Bavarian state premier Horst Seehofer has invited U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to visit the southern German state, possibly as soon as February for the Munich Security Conference, a source familiar with the invitation said. Seehofer, who heads the Christian Social Union (CSU), sister party to Chancellor Angela Merkels conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), extended the invitation in a letter of congratulations to Trump after his victory, said the source. The Feb. 17-19 conference, a forum for debate about international security, often draws senior officials from around the world. Trump will be inaugurated on Jan. 20. It was not immediately clear when a sitting U.S. president last participated in the event, and the security conference organizers could not immediately be reached for comment. Seehofers CSU and Merkels CDU, which form a bloc in the German parliament, have been at odds over Merkels migrant policy, which saw nearly 900,000 people enter Germany last year, an issue likely to play a major role in elections in September. During the U.S. election campaign Trump called Merkels refugee policy a disaster that had boosted crime rates. Statistics compiled by the German Interior Ministry showed the number of crimes reported in 2015 - excluding visa and other immigration violations - remained essentially unchanged from the previous year at 5.9 million. Seehofer told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper in an interview published on Thursday that his party would only participate in a coalition government in 2017 that agreed to its demand for an upper limit on migration. Merkel, who on Sunday announced her decision to run for a fourth term, has rejected setting an upper limit for migration. ",politicsNews,"November 24, 2016 ",1

"Business booms at Trump Tower, nearby retailers hit by security and crowds","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bailey White, 13, stood patiently in line with her little brother Keaton at the gift store inside the Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue on Wednesday afternoon, each clutching a stuffed terrier named Charlie that cost $35 per item. The beagle, with a Trump monogram on its white bandana, was modeled on the pet dog of Eric Trump, the son of President-elect Donald Trump. It was one of the few items left on the shelves of the store, which had sold out of that mornings fresh batch of red MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN t-shirts by noon. Bailey and Keaton, 10, however, were happy with their score. The children, who had traveled to New York from Florida originally for the Thanksgiving Day Parade, told Reuters they were huge fans of Donald Trump, listing at the top of their reasons his commitment to reduce illegal immigration. Or, as the younger brother puts it, To stop bad guys from getting in our country. As businesses around the president-elects glitzy New York home have had to deal with extra security and crowds reducing foot traffic sales in the lead up to Fifth Avenues busiest shopping weekend, Trump souvenirs have been flying off the shelves at the billionaires gift store. Trump supporters like the White siblings and their mom Laura have proven to be a boon for at least one of the his businesses in the immediate aftermath of the U.S. presidential election. In just one hour, a Reuters reporter counted at least 100 people crowding the shop located on the lower level of the Tower to buy hats, pins and more. Many were disappointed to find the $30 dollar red MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN hat and all campaign t-shirts out of stock.  Just one door over, a single salesman sat in dim lighting in the middle of the day at a New York City souvenir store, also in Trump Tower, greeting visitors with, Looking for Trump merchandise? before redirecting them.  When asked if the number of visitors inside the Trump Tower had increased since the presidential results, a security guard in the building replied: One hundred percent.   Outside, where some of the worlds most well-known retailers spend more on rent than in just about any other city, shoppers had to fight through security, crowds and media packs to enter the Gucci store or tony jeweler Tiffanys. Rosalia Betancourt, 69, first trekked to Trump Tower two days after Trump was elected in search for the eponymous red hat. They were sold out. When Betancourt, who moved to New York from Venezuela more than four decades ago, braved holiday crowds a week later on Wednesday, she had to leave empty-handed once again.  Its all right she said. I guess Ill go online. It just has to be red. Sari Nielsen, 71, was waiting at the Trump Cafe next door to the shop for the crowds to die down.  I want to buy my nephew Pete a Trump golf hat for Thanksgiving, said Nielsen, who moved to New York in 1975 from Argentina. Shoppers also had the option of buying Trump cufflinks, blankets, bags, perfume, candy, books authored by members of the family and more. The line shortened somewhat during lunchtime when visitors turned their attention to the Trump Grill, which does not offer reservations but a $25 dollar fixed-price meal. Trisha Williams, 50, of San Jose, California also made the trip to New York for the parade with her son Cayden, 8, who stayed up and watched the election. The two stood outside the Trump Tower with their gold Trump store bags. We wanted to experience it all and buy some merchandise, Trisha said. But many of the items she wanted to buy were not available.  They didnt really have very much, Trisha said noting that a saleswoman at the store gave her a card outlining how she can make purchases online and that shes already followed her advice. I wanted a jacket with a Trump logo and a t-shirt, but they didnt really have anything left. ",politicsNews,"November 24, 2016 ",1
Haley lends Trump team diversity but little diplomatic heft,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - By picking fellow Republican South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, U.S. President-elect Donald Trumps pick rounded out his early Cabinet choices with his first woman and ethnic minority. But he also opted for a state politician with little experience in the federal government or international diplomacy who has been a sharp critic, backing two of his rivals and criticizing the harsh rhetoric of the presidential campaign. In tapping the popular governor of a state that supported him, Trumps choice could signal an attempt to reach out to minorities in the wake of his Nov. 8 victory following a bitterly divisive campaign. His victory has sparked protests and concerns by those worried that his denunciation of immigrants, Muslims and Hispanics during the campaign could translate into policies eroding civil rights. Trump said on Wednesday that Haley could bring people together and was a proven dealmaker who will be a great leader representing us on the world stage. Haley, 44, represents what some Republicans have said could be the new face of the Republican Party: a younger, more diverse generation of leaders who could help bolster conservatives as U.S. demographics shift.  The daughter of Indian immigrants, she drew national attention in 2015 when she led a push to remove the Confederate battle flag from the state capitol grounds in Columbia after a white gunman killed nine people at a historic predominantly African-American church in Charleston. But Haley, now serving her second four-year term as governor, has little experience in foreign policy and the diplomatic issues likely to come before the United Nations.  In a statement on Wednesday, she praised the states residents for taking a chance on a little-known, 38-year old, minority, female governor when she took office six years ago.    Like Trump, Haley came to politics as an outsider. After years working in her familys gift shop in Bamberg, a small town an hour south of the state capital, she ran for state representative in 2004 and defeated a nearly 30-year incumbent, touting her fiscal conservatism while brushing off racial slurs. She won her gubernatorial bid in 2010 on a platform of reform, receiving the endorsement of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, a former Republican vice presidential nominee and darling of the partys Tea Party wing.    Still, Haley has not hesitated to call out fellow Republicans, including Trump. In January, she offered the partys rebuttal to President Barack Obamas State of the Union address, seizing the spotlight in what was seen as a strong rebuke of Trump.  Haley called for tolerance and civility in her remarks. Although she never mentioned Trump by name, she urged Americans not to  follow the siren call of the angriest voices, adding: No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country. But she told the Federalist Society recently that although she was not an early or vocal supporter of Trump, she did vote for him and was thrilled that he won. Born to Sikh parents who emigrated to South Carolina from India, she is no stranger to U.S. racial and ethnic tensions.  While Trump won with the lowest minority vote in decades,, Haley has scolded Republicans for not working harder to broaden their appeal beyond white Americans. Our approach often appears cold and unwelcoming to minorities. Thats shameful and that has to change, she said in a 2015 National Press Club speech. Its on us to communicate our positions in ways that wipe away the clutter of prejudices. Although she worked to heal the racial tensions that exploded after the gun attack at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in 2015, she has also been critical of the Black Lives Matter movement that gained ground after a series of high-profile shootings of unarmed African-Americans by police. Some people think you have to yell and scream in order to make a difference. Well, thats just not true, she told the National Press Club. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying and that can make a world of difference.     On Wednesday, Haley said, When the President believes you have a major contribution to make to the welfare of our nation, and to our nations standing in the world, that is a calling that is important to heed. Her international experience is largely centered on her efforts to draw foreign businesses to South Carolina, including at least eight overseas trips, local media reported. One - a June 2011 trip billed as an economic development mission to Europe and the Paris Air Show - cost the state $158,000 and drew criticism back home over its luxury accommodations and a hotel party. She said afterwards she did not know how much was spent and had learned a lesson, even as she pledged to keep up the sales pitches, the Charleston Post and Courier reported at the time. There is a method to the madness, she said, according to the newspaper. I am selling the state the only way I know how. The Post and Courier said her trips included trade show visits and economic development meetings, including stops related to BMW (BMWG.DE) and Volvo (VOLVb.ST), two automakers with facilities in South Carolina. She has visited Germany, Sweden, Britain, Japan, Canada and India, it reported. As governor, she has also been embroiled in the thorny issue of nuclear waste amid federal facilities in the state aimed at  storing and converting such materials. Earlier this year, she fought to have some nuclear material from Japan headed for South Carolina moved to New Mexico. Critics will ask if Nikki Haley has been engaged in intl affairs. Ive had convos w/her on & off over the years. She has a strong worldview, Dan Senor, a former adviser to 2012 Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney, said on Twitter.

"Trump names Haley, a foreign policy novice, as envoy to U.N.","WEST PALM BEACH, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump on Wednesday named South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, a former critic with little foreign policy experience, as the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations at a time of uncertainty over Americas international role under his presidency.

She will be a great leader representing us on the world stage, the Republican president-elect said in a statement. Trump on Wednesday also picked wealthy Republican donor and school choice advocate Betsy DeVos to lead the Education Department. Haley, the 44-year-old daughter of Indian immigrants, represents what some Republicans hope could be the new face of their party: a younger, more diverse generation of leaders.      Haley took Trump strongly to task during the presidential campaign over his harsh rhetoric about illegal immigration and for not speaking forcefully enough against white supremacists. Trump has chosen mostly male conservatives so far for senior positions as he shapes his administration following his victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. Trump takes over from Democratic President Barack Obama on Jan. 20.  Also on Wednesday, a spokesman for former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said Trump had not offered the retired neurosurgeon the post of housing and urban development secretary, disputing a Wall Street Journal report, which the newspaper later corrected. Trump did not make an offer, Carson spokesman Armstrong Williams told Reuters. He asked him to consider HUD. Nothing has been offered and no decision has been made. Carson told Fox News on Wednesday night: We are considering which is the way that I can be most effective. So that information should come out in the next few days. We will make a public announcement.   The Wall Street Journal, citing two people familiar with the deliberations, also reported that Trump was expected to pick billionaire investor Wilbur Ross as commerce secretary. In a video message released ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, Trump said he hoped it would be a time for Americans to begin to heal our divisions following a long and bruising political campaign. Emotions are raw and tensions just dont heal overnight, Trump said. Now begins a great national campaign to rebuild our country and to restore the full promise of America for all of our people. The choice of Haley may be aimed at countering criticism of Trumps divisive comments about immigrants and minorities, as well as accusations of sexism during his election campaign. Haley led a successful effort last year to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina state capitol after the killing of nine black churchgoers in Charleston. The flag was carried by pro-slavery Confederate forces during the Civil War and is viewed by many as a racist emblem.  Haley said she had accepted Trumps offer and would remain governor pending her confirmation to the Cabinet-level post by the U.S. Senate. When the president believes you have a major contribution to make to the welfare of our nation, and to our nations standing in the world, that is a calling that is important to heed, she said in a statement. Haleys job may include reassuring allies worried about some of Trumps campaign promises, including building a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border to curb illegal immigration and reviewing trade agreements, and his suggestion that he would push NATO partners to pay more for their own defense. He has antagonized China, another major power at the United Nations, with his talk on trade and territorial disputes in the South China Sea.      The New York real estate magnate, who has never held public office, gave few clues about his world view during an extensive interview with The New York Times on Tuesday.     Asked what he sees as Americas role in the world, Trump replied: Thats such a big question. When pressed further, he described the Iraq war as a mistake, urged better relations with Russia and called for an end to that craziness thats going on in Syria. The United States, which along with Russia is one of the five permanent veto powers on the 15-member U.N. Security Council, is also the largest funder of the United Nations, paying more than a quarter of its $8 billion peace-keeping budget and 22 percent of the regular budget.   Trump picked conservatives to lead his national security and law enforcement teams last week, suggesting he plans to make good on his campaign promises to take a hard line on Islamist militancy and curbing illegal immigration But a relative moderate, former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, is among the candidates under consideration to head the State Department. Haley would succeed Obamas U.N. envoy, Samantha Power, a foreign policy expert before she took the job. In contrast, Haley, a state lawmaker before becoming governor, has little experience in international relations. She was a robust critic of Trump during the early stages of the Republican presidential nominating race, including condemning him for not disavowing the support of the Ku Klux Klan and one of the white supremacist groups former leaders, David Duke. In a rebuttal to Obamas State of the Union address in January, Haley called for tolerance on immigration and civility in politics, in what some saw as a rebuke of Trump.  During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices, she said. We must resist that temptation. She supported Trump rivals Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, both U.S. senators, in the Republican race before saying last month she would vote for Trump despite reservations about his character. Haley also criticized Trump last winter for not releasing his tax returns, prompting him to hit back on Twitter: The people of South Carolina are embarrassed of Nikki Haley! DeVos, Trumps education pick, is a billionaire former chair of the Michigan Republican Party, who has long pushed for a larger role for private education. Trump said she would break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back. Her appointment is also subject to Senate confirmation.     As chair of the American Federation for Children advocacy group, DeVos has advocated for vouchers that families can use to send their children to private schools and for the expansion of charter schools. The National Education Association, the countrys largest teachers union, condemned DeVos nomination. She has consistently pushed a corporate agenda to privatize, de-professionalize and impose cookie-cutter solutions to public education, said NEA President Lily Eskelsen Garcia.

Trump taps Michigan Republican DeVos for education secretary: reports,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has tapped wealthy Republican donor and school choice advocate Betsy DeVos to lead the U.S. Education Department, a post she has accepted, according to media reports on Wednesday.  DeVos, former chair of the Michigan Republican Party, met with Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence on Saturday and discussed the Common Core mission, and setting higher national standards and promoting the growth of school choice across the nation, according to a Trump transition team statement.

Polling calls to U.S. Muslims raise surveillance fears,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Muslims across the United States feared they were being targeted for surveillance this week when they received automated polling calls asking them to press one if they identified as Muslim or two if they did not. Many worried President-elect Donald Trump was making good on his campaign promise to register all Muslims in the country or private citizens were laying the groundwork for a registry. The calls were in fact sent out as part of a survey by Emerge USA, a non-profit organization seeking to empower Muslim-Americans. The group created an algorithm to call Muslims for a poll on their views and experiences after the Nov. 8 national election, Sarah Cochran, director of its Virginia chapter, said on Wednesday. Cochran said she had to reassure some call recipients that Emerge USA was conducting the poll, and an anti-Islam group was not using the organizations name as a disguise.  All of our work is affected, where we cant get people to participate because theyre afraid, said Cochran. Since Trumps stunning election win, Muslims living in the United States have been on edge. One of his supporters has cited camps where Japanese-Americans were interned during World War Two as a precedent for a registry. Trumps choice for national security adviser, Michael Flynn, in a recent video described Islamism as a vicious cancer inside the body of 1.7 billion people on this planet and it has to be excised. On Tuesday, the Council of American-Islamic Relations posted on Twitter and Facebook asking about reports American Muslims were receiving robocalls on how they identify. Meanwhile, others posted to their own social media accounts with questions about the calls. One call recipient posted on Facebook Not sure if this is a scam or this is real but I have surely reported and urge you to report as well if you get the same phone call. Welcome to the new world!

"Trump defeated Clinton by 10,704 votes in Michigan: unofficial tally","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican President-elect Donald Trump defeated Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by 10,704 votes in the state of Michigan, according to certified unofficial county-by-county results released on Wednesday by the Michigan secretary of state. Trump received 2,279,543 votes compared with Clintons 2,268,839, according to figures posted on the secretary of states website. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson received 172,136 votes and Green candidate Jill Stein won 51,463. Nine other candidates shared a total of nearly 30,000 additional votes in the presidential campaign in Michigan, the figures showed. The results will remain unofficial until they are reviewed and approved by the Board of State Canvassers on Nov. 28. Some media organizations did not call a winner of the presidential race in Michigan on election night because of the closeness of the race. Michigan is the last state where the winner was not yet clear. The final unofficial tally gave Trump a slightly narrower victory than previous counts. A count as of Nov. 15 reported by CNN, for example, showed Trump winning 2,279,805 votes and Clinton winning 2,268,193, a margin of 11,612 votes. If Trump is declared the winner in Michigan, he will have accumulated 306 electoral votes to Clintons 232. Clinton is leading in the popular vote by more than 2 million, according to the Cook Political Report. ",politicsNews,"November 23, 2016 ",1
Trump has not offered Carson U.S. housing post: spokesman,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump has not extended an offer to retired neurosurgeon and former presidential rival Ben Carson to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development, a Carson spokesman said on Wednesday, disputing a report by the Wall Street Journal. Trump did not make an offer, Carson spokesman Armstrong Williams told Reuters. He asked him to consider HUD. Nothing has been offered and no decision has been made. The Wall Street Journal earlier had cited Williams as saying Carson had been offered the post and had accepted. The Journal later corrected its story to say Carson was being considered for the HUD job. @realDonaldTrump is considering @RealBenCarson for a cabinet post. Dr. Carson is prayerfully & seriously considering, Armstrong said on Twitter. On Tuesday, Armstrong had told Reuters that Trump had asked Carson to consider taking the post and that Carson was considering it. As recently as last week, Carson, 65, had told The Washington Post he was not interested in a Cabinet job, saying, Having me as a federal bureaucrat would be like a fish out of water. But he and Trump met on Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York, and earlier on Wednesday Carson posted on Facebook that after the talks he felt that I can make a significant contribution particularly to making our inner cities great for everyone.

"Factbox: Trump picks women for U.N. ambassador, education secretary","(Reuters) - Republican U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday named the first women to his team of top officials: South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley for U.N. ambassador, and school choice advocate Betsy DeVos for education secretary. The following are details about his selections so far. All but the national security adviser post require U.S. Senate confirmation: U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: GOVERNOR NIKKI HALEY Haley, a 44-year-old Republican and the daughter of Indian immigrants, has been governor of South Carolina since 2011 and has little experience in foreign policy or the federal government. She led a successful push last year to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina state capitol after the killing of nine black churchgoers in Charleston by a white gunman. DeVos, 58, is a billionaire Republican donor, a former chair of the Michigan Republican Party and an advocate for the privatization of education. As chair of the American Federation for Children, she has pushed at the state level for vouchers that families can use to send their children to private schools and for the expansion of charter schools. Sessions, 69, was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trumps presidential bid and has been a close ally since. The son of a country-store owner, the senator from Alabama and former federal prosecutor has long taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.  NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: RETIRED LIEUTENANT GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN Flynn, 57, was an early supporter of Trump and serves as vice chairman on his transition team. He began his U.S. Army career in 1981 and served deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. Flynn became head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2012 under President Barack Obama, but retired a year earlier than expected, according to media reports, and became a fierce critic of Obamas foreign policy. Pompeo, 52, is a third-term congressman from Kansas who serves on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA, National Security Agency and cyber security. A retired Army officer, West Point and Harvard Law School graduate, Pompeo supports the U.S. governments sweeping collection of Americans communications data and wants to scrap the nuclear deal with Iran.

Elton John denies he will play at Trump inauguration,"(Reuters) - Britains Sir Elton John will not perform at the inauguration of Donald Trump in Washington as U.S. president, the singer-songwriters spokeswoman said on Wednesday. Anthony Scaramucci, an economic adviser to Trumps campaign, said John would be performing in a BBC radio interview during which Scaramucci also said the Republican president-elect had a pro-gay rights stance. Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the Mall for the inauguration, Scaramucci added in the interview for  HARDtalk, broadcast on Wednesday. Elton will not be performing at Trumps inaugural, the singers publicist, Fran Curtis, responded. John, a prominent gay rights activist, performed at fundraisers for Democrat Hillary Clinton during the U.S. presidential election campaign. He also objected when Trump played his Rocket Man and Tiny Dancer songs without permission during rallies and campaign appearances earlier this year, saying that any use of his music should not be seen as an endorsement of Donald Trump. A spokesman for the Trump inauguration committee did not respond to a request for comment on Scaramuccis claim.   ",politicsNews,"November 23, 2016 ",1
Big banks' relationship with Dodd-Frank: it's complicated,"(Reuters) - Having spent billions of dollars on post-crisis U.S. financial industry reforms they once scorned, bankers are concerned the Trump administration, joined by a like-minded Congress, will scrap or significantly change the rules. To comply with a rule known as Dodd-Frank, which was enacted in 2010 following the financial crisis, big U.S banks hired tens of thousands of staffers, built new technology systems, hived off businesses, simplified corporate structures and doubled the amount of capital they hold. JPMorgan Chase & Co has said that in its mortgage business alone, employees spent 800,000 hours in compliance training in a single year. The industry went into these changes kicking and screaming. Banks lobbied hard against Dodd-Frank as it was being drafted, then cajoled regulators to go easy in defining and implementing precise rules. But now that the heavy lifting has been done and Dodd-Frank is largely in effect, the industry see a total  elimination as more of a threat than a blessing. Dodd-Frank has largely made banks safer and the once-opaque derivatives market more transparent, banking executives said.  President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, and some important lawmakers in the incoming Republican Congress have pledged to dismantle the law and put a new one in place. It is not yet clear what the replacement would look like, but Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, has drafted a blueprint called The CHOICE Act. The proposal has a mix of things the industry largely supports, such as abolishing the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), but it also has some ideas Wall Street vehemently opposes, like ramping up capital requirements to a level that would likely force big banks to split apart. Proposed changes are also likely to run into stiff opposition from some congressional Democrats, particularly Senator Elizabeth Warren, architect of the CFPB. Big U.S. banks including JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley have seen big gains in their share prices since the Nov. 8 election, partly on expectations that regulators will soon have a much lighter touch. There is scope for lower taxes, less regulation, and more growth, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a report on Tuesday recommending big bank stocks. However, bankers, lawyers and consultants who spoke to Reuters said any big rollback in rulemaking could take several years to implement and may introduce more costs. One of the dangers of dismantling regulation is that it will be costly and disruptive, said Mike Alix, a consultant at PwC who works with banks on regulatory matters. By and large theyve gotten themselves into shape and theyre not looking to get out of shape. Industry sources said they are hoping its possible to roll back some elements of Dodd-Frank that they view as too onerous or misguided, without scrapping the entire law. For instance, many would like to see the Volcker rule, which places restrictions on proprietary trading, go away. The rule was intended to prevent federally insured banks from placing speculative bets in the markets, and would be repealed as part of Hensarlings plan. Some banks are taking a second look at compliance initiatives until they gain further clarity on what will happen in Washington. At a conference this month, Bank of America Corp Chief Operating Officer Tom Montag said he is being a little more cautious about compliance spending. It is difficult to know whether it is worth spending another $30 million on Volcker rule compliance, he said, because doing so may be a waste of money but not doing so could leave the bank at risk if the rule is implemented as planned. Even if Volcker doesnt go away, there are still questions about how tough the enforcement would be, said Mark Nuccio, who leads the bank regulatory practice at law firm Ropes & Gray LLP. Banks are deciding they may take the foot off the gas pedal now and just see what happens. ",politicsNews,"November 23, 2016 ",1

Mexican cement maker ready to help Trump build border wall,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A Mexican cement maker is ready to lend its services to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to build the wall he wants to erect on the southern border of the United States to curb immigration. We cant be choosy, Enrique Escalante, Chief Executive Officer of Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua (GCC) said in an interview. Were an important producer in that area and we have to respect our clients on both sides of the border. Republican Trump campaigned vowing to build a big, beautiful, powerful wall across the 2,000 mile (3,200 km) frontier in order to stop illegal immigrants from Mexico, which he accused of sending rapists and drug traffickers north. The campaign of the New York businessman who has never previously held public office was widely reviled in Mexico. Parts of the border are already divided by high fences, and a huge part of the boundary runs along the Rio Grande river. Based in Chihuahua, a large northern state bordering Texas and New Mexico, GCC is one of the biggest construction materials companies in Mexico. It generates around 70 percent of its sales in the United States, where it also has three plants. Escalante said Trumps plans to invest in energy and infrastructure in the United States augured well for the firm.     For the business were in, Trump is a candidate that does favor the industry quite a bit, Escalante said. GCC, whose shares are trading at their highest levels since 2008, is 23 percent owned by Mexican multinational cement company Cemex, which at the end of September announced plans to sell its stake.

Iran warns of retaliation if U.S. breaches nuclear deal,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Extending U.S. sanctions on Iran for 10 years would breach the Iranian nuclear agreement, Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said on Wednesday, warning that Tehran would retaliate if the sanctions are approved.  The U.S. House of Representatives re-authorized last week the Iran Sanctions Act, or ISA, for 10 years. The law was first adopted in 1996 to punish investments in Irans energy industry and deter Irans pursuit of nuclear weapons. The Iran measure will expire at the end of 2016 if it is not renewed. The House bill must still be passed by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama to become law. Iran and world powers concluded the nuclear agreement, also known as JCPOA, last year. It imposed curbs on Irans nuclear program in return for easing sanctions that have badly hurt its economy.  The current U.S. government has breached the nuclear deal in many occasions, Khamenei said, addressing a gathering of members of the Revolutionary Guards, according to his website.  The latest is extension of sanctions for 10 years, that if it happens, would surely be against JCPOA, and the Islamic Republic would definitely react to it.  The U.S. lawmakers passed the bill one week after Republican Donald Trump was elected U.S. president. Republicans in Congress unanimously opposed the agreement, along with about two dozen Democrats, and Trump has also criticized it. Lawmakers from both parties said they hoped bipartisan support for a tough line against Iran would continue under the new president. President-elect Trump once said during his campaign that he would rip up the agreement, drawing a harsh reaction from Khamenei, who said if that happens, Iran would set fire to the deal. The House of Representatives also passed a bill last week that would block the sale of commercial aircraft by Boeing (BA.N) and Airbus (AIR.PA) to Iran.  The White House believes that the legislation would be a violation of the nuclear pact and has said Obama would veto the measure even if it did pass the Senate.  ",politicsNews,"November 23, 2016 ",1
Judge blocks Obama rule extending overtime pay to 4.2 million U.S. workers,"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday blocked an Obama administration rule to extend mandatory overtime pay to more than 4 million salaried workers from taking effect, imperiling one of the outgoing presidents signature achievements for boosting wages. U.S. District Judge Amos Mazzant, in Sherman, Texas, agreed with 21 states and a coalition of business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, that the rule is unlawful and granted their motion for a nationwide injunction.  The rule, issued by the Labor Department, was to take effect Dec. 1 and would have doubled to $47,500 the maximum salary a worker can earn and still be eligible for mandatory overtime pay. The new threshold would have been the first significant change in four decades. It was expected to touch nearly every sector of the U.S. economy and have the greatest impact on nonprofit groups, retail companies, hotels and restaurants, which have many management workers whose salaries are below the new threshold. The states and business groups claimed in lawsuits filed in September, which were later consolidated, that the drastic increase in the salary threshold was arbitrary. On Tuesday, Mazzant, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, ruled that the federal law governing overtime does not allow the Labor Department to decide which workers are eligible based on salary levels alone. The Fair Labor Standards Act says that employees can be exempt from overtime if they perform executive, administrative or professional duties, but the rule creates essentially a de facto salary-only test, Mazzant wrote in the 20-page ruling. The states and business groups that challenged the rule applauded the decision. Nevada Attorney General Adam Paul Laxalt said in a statement that the ruling reinforces the importance of the rule of law and constitutional government. The Labor Department said it strongly disagrees with the decision. It remains confident that the entire rule is legal, and it is currently considering its options, department spokesman Jason Surbey said. The Labor Department can appeal to the New Orleans, Louisiana-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, but that court has stymied the Obama administration before, blocking Obamas executive actions on immigration in 2015. In any case, the Labor Department could drop the appeal after Republican President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. In August, Trump told the website Circa that the overtime rule was an example of the type of burdensome business regulations he would seek to roll back as president, perhaps by exempting small businesses or delaying implementation. Even if the rule survived the legal challenge, it could be upended by legislation passed by Congress or withdrawn by Trumps Department of Labor.   U.S. Chamber of Commerce official Randy Johnson said in a statement that the rule would have been costly and disruptive to businesses. But Ross Eisenbrey of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, which supported the rule, called the decision extreme and unsupportable. It is also a disappointment to millions of workers who are forced to work long hours with no extra compensation, and is a blow to those Americans who care deeply about raising wages and lessening inequality, Eisenbrey said in a statement. The case is Nevada v. U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, No. 16-cv-731. ",politicsNews,"November 22, 2016 ",1
Democrats search for answers to stem a spreading Republican tide,"MONTPELIER, Vt. (Reuters) - Still sifting through the wreckage of the Nov. 8 election, Democratic leaders nationwide are struggling to find a new message to claw back support and avoid years in the political wilderness.      Not only do Republicans control the White House and both the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives, they now hold 33 governors offices.  New England, long considered reliably Democratic, is a prime example of the partys demise. Republican Phil Scott won in Vermont over Democrat Sue Minter who was criticized, like presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, for failing to develop an economic message that resonated with voters worried about good-paying jobs.     Considered a liberal bastion, Vermont has a tradition of sometimes choosing a Republican governor to keep one party from having too much control. Elsewhere, Republican Chris Sununu will replace a Democratic governor in New Hampshire while Maine and Massachusetts already have Republican governors. We lost the governorship of freaking Vermont, lamented Washington-based Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis. We didnt just lose an election. This was a national rebuke. This was biblical.    Republicans also command 32 state legislatures and have full control  meaning they hold the governors office and both legislative chambers  in 24 states, including swing states such as Florida, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. When President Barack Obama was elected in 2008, they controlled just nine. There are more Republicans at the state legislative level than there have ever been, said Tim Storey, an analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures.      Republicans scored a major coup when they seized the Senate in traditionally liberal Minnesota, giving it full control of the legislature, and they gained full control of next-door Iowa. The partys message, structure and apparatus are broken, said Kofinis, who was chief of staff to moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. We havent acknowledged it for years because we had the White House. Obamas two terms masked a crumbling party infrastructure. During Obamas tenure, Democrats lost over 800 state legislative seats, at least 13 governorships and both houses of Congress.  Party insiders are reluctant to blame the popular Obama but cite plenty of reasons for the decline. These include a muddled economic message; an overemphasis on emerging demographic groups such as minorities and millennial at the expense of white voters; a perception the party is elitist and aligned with Wall Street; a reluctance to embrace the progressive populism of Senator Bernie Sanders, the former presidential hopeful; and failure to field strong candidates in key states. There is an emerging consensus, they add, that the party has been too focused on winning national races and has not invested enough in local campaigns, along with a grudging admission that Republicans have done a better job of competing on the ground. As a result, a poor performance by the Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections gave Republicans control of statehouses across the country, allowing them to redraw legislative maps to fashion districts that would help ensure their long-term electoral success. I think the foundation was built back in 2010, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker told Reuters. There was a big wave and then for many of us that were elected in 10, we got reelected in 14 in battleground states - Wisconsin, Florida, Ohio, Michigan. You look at the states that were key to the presidential win, were states where Republicans did well in 10 and then sustained it. UNDER-RESOURCED Democrats are working to recover and looking ahead to governors races in New Jersey and Virginia next year to make up lost ground. Governors offices have become crucial for another reason: Republican governors signed voter suppression measures in states such as North Carolina that Democrats believe damaged turnout. Sununu has said that as one of his first acts as governor in New Hampshire, he would like to end the states practice of allowing same-day voter registration. As with redistricting, it is another lever of power that Republicans can wield to make sure they remain in the majority for a long time. Obama has said he will actively support a new party initiative, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee,that seeks to restore state-level Democratic power.  Mark Schauer, a former Michigan congressman who is a senior adviser to the effort, said the goal is to have a central organization direct resources into critical local races. Schauer, who lost his congressional seat after Republican legislators excised his home county from his district, said deep-pocketed Democratic donors have not always appreciated the need to support state races.  A state senate race isnt as sexy as a presidential or big U.S. Senate race, Schauer said.  Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, the party arm charged with overseeing state races, agreed. We have felt under-resourced. When Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor and presidential candidate, ran the Democratic National Committee, he adopted a 50-state strategy, investing funds in every state, even ones perceived to be hostile to Democrats, in an effort to identify viable candidates for local office.  While Deans plan was not the sole reason, Democrats had election successes in 2006 and 2008. When Dean left the DNC, his strategy faded and the partys fortunes at the state level began to decline.  Dean is a candidate to run the DNC again and has said he will revive the strategy if elected to the post.  What is happening is a result of decades of smart organizing by conservatives who have very simply poured resources, talent and energy into creating an infrastructure at the state, local, and now national level, said Bill Lofy, a long-time Democratic strategist in Vermont.  He said Governor-elect Scott was very effective at making this, in a generic sense, about kitchen-table economic issues in a way that paralleled with the presidential race. And like Trump, he said, Scott spent very little time talking about how is going to implement the policies he was proposing. It was more about Scott telling voters: Trust me. Im on your side.

Illinois fix to unpaid bills may end up as financial time bomb,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois owes a handful of financial consortia more than $118 million under an obscure program intended to speed up overdue payments to the cash-strapped states vendors, an analysis of state records shows. Political feuding between Republican Governor Bruce Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature has kept Illinois without a full operating budget since July 2015, contributing to a doubling of the unpaid bills backlog. The amount of overdue bills could reach $13.5 billion, or 40 percent of available operating revenue, when the current fiscal year ends June 30, the Rauner administration has projected.  Come fiscal 2022, the backlog is projected to balloon to $47 billion. No other U.S. state defers payments to the extent Illinois does to manage cash flow, credit-rating analysts said. The one-of-its-kind, bill-payment program seeks to avert the nightmare scenario for a state in the worst financial shape in the country: a shutdown of essential services such as employee health insurance, a disruption of prison food supplies or mothballing of state trooper cars in need of fuel and maintenance. I dont think there is any other alternative for us, Illinois Central Management Services Director Michael Hoffman told a legislative panel in May. But it comes at a heavy cost with unlimited late-payment fees now approaching 20 percent in some cases for Illinois cash-strapped government, whose general obligation (GO) low-investment grade credit ratings are the lowest among U.S. states.  The states negative credit outlook means its $26 billion of outstanding GO bonds could lurch closer to the junk level if the growing unpaid bill pile impairs its ability to provide essential services, affects debt payments and inflates its already huge $130 billion unfunded pension liability.     No other state or business would operate by incurring obligations to its vendors and setting up a third-party payment structure that dramatically inflates the costs of those services, said Laurence Msall, president of the Chicago-based Civic Federation, a non-partisan government watchdog.  Under the Vendor Support Initiative (VSI) program launched last year to replace a similar plan introduced in 2011, state vendors can get paid without delay 90 percent of what they are owed by state-designated financial lenders.  When the state finally pays, the vendors get the final 10 percent, while the lenders keep the late-penalty fees. In Illinois, receivables more than 90 days past due accumulate interest at a rate of 1 percent per month. For the lenders, the risk is that the state will not pay up and they will need to fight for compensation in courts, but that has not happened yet. The firms include financial institutions such as Citibank N.A. (C.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), a distressed debt investor tied to a Rauner campaign donor, and political insiders, including Hillary Clintons 2008 campaign manager and a former two-term Republican Illinois governor. Lindsay Trittipoe, majority investor of the second-largest consortium, Illinois Financing Partners LLP, told Reuters his group was performing a vital function rather than exploiting the states financial miseries. Our money is flowing into the market, helping the wheels of commerce to keep working, he said. Citi and Bank of America declined to comment for this story and representatives from the largest state-qualified buyer of receivables, Chicago-based Vendor Assistance Program, and some of its investors did not respond to interview requests. Fees on unpaid bills in the program have been growing by more than $2.6 million per week and could exceed $194 million by June 30, according to a Reuters analysis of state data as of Sept. 28. By the end of Rauner's term in January 2019, total interest on unpaid receivables in the program could exceed $351 million if there is no progress in reducing the bill backlog, Reuters calculations show. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2fW1vxj) That total represents more than what Illinois allocated in operating funds last June to keep seven of its nine public universities open for six months.  As of late September, four participating VSI lenders had bought 15,369 unpaid receivables worth $1.12 billion under the program. Late-payment penalties on those billings surpassed $118 million and continue to grow, Reuters has found. Illinois law places no limit on how long the late fees can accrue and since 2010 the state has spent about $929 million in late-payment penalties, according to state comptroller data. Three of the four firms now involved also took part in a similar program launched under previous Democratic Governor Pat Quinn. Its current version has sparked questions over how firms were vetted, a lack of up-to-date disclosures about their owners and financing, and patchy accounting of vendor payments. Additionally, state business registration of one of the firms, Payplant LLC, expired two months before the programs launch, according to the Illinois secretary of states office. A company representative blamed a procedural lapse and said it had begun the process in October to reinstate its LLC status. The focus should be on transparency, said Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs, a Democrat. If we have a program like this, we dont want to turn it over to loan sharks. Using the state data, Reuters calculated the average rate on late payments at 8.14 percent through late September. During that same period, the Dow Jones Industrial Average only gained 3.65 percent. It seems that (it) creates a real perverse incentive for them to wait as long as they can, Democratic Representative Elaine Nekritz said about the buyers of vendor invoices.  State spokeswoman Meredith Krantz defended the program, saying it helped vendors be paid more quickly than the states payment cycle would otherwise allow.  One big non-profit participating state vendor, Chicago-based Safer Foundation, saw no other options. Do you want to get nothing or 90 percent now and the other 10 percent later? said Victor Dickson, the groups president and CEO. We chose, Lets get 90 percent and keep serving our clients.

Factbox: The companies making money from Illinois’ unpaid bills,"(Reuters) - During a 10-month period starting in November 2015, four firms qualified by Illinois Governor Bruce Rauners administration purchased $1.12 billion in unpaid bills due scores of vendors providing critical goods and services. In return, the firms stood to pocket at least $118 million in state-funded late-payment penalties as of late September. Firm			       Receivables acquired*      Late-payment penalty* Vendor Assistance Program		$707.2 million	$82.4 million  Illinois Financing Partners 	$275.4 million	$18.6 million Vendor Capital Finance LLC	$145 million 	$16.9 million Payplant 	$475,330 	$39,530 *As of Sept. 28, 2016 Source: Illinois Department of Central Management Services Vendor Assistance Program (VAP) VAPs February 2014 disclosure, its latest available, identifies six funding sources and 12 owners, including Citibank N.A. and the consulting firm owned by Democratic political strategist Patti Solis Doyle, Hillary Clintons 2008 presidential campaign manager. Another VAP investor listed on that document is Manchester Securities, which is owned by billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Singer and had a 4 percent stake. State records show Singer donated $250,000 to Rauner in September 2014, two months before Rauners election and 14 months before the launch of the Rauner administrations Vendor Support Initiative.  Argentina dubbed an affiliated Singer-owned company a vulture investor for its hardball tactics in a decade-plus legal battle with the South American nation over defaulted sovereign debt. At one point, the Singer firm had an Argentine naval training vessel briefly impounded by Ghana in an attempt to extract money from Buenos Aires. Illinois Financing Partners(IFP) Illinois Financing Partners, LLCs involvement in the program is backed by a $500 million Bank of America commitment, according to an IFP filing with the state in April. IFPs purchases have consisted entirely of overdue Health Alliance bills. The groups president, founder and majority investor is Lindsay Trittipoe, who holds a 58 percent stake in the company.  IFPs minority investors include former two-term Illinois Republican Governor Jim Edgar, who is IFPs board chairman, and former U.S. Representative Jerry Costello, an Illinois Democrat. Both hold 1 percent stakes in the company. Vendor Capital Finance LLC A February 2014 disclosure to Illinois, the most recent available, lists New York municipal finance consultant Le Chen as VCFs chief executive officer. LeRose, LLC, of which Chen is identified as the lone member in state business records, reported a 6 percent ownership stake in VCF. With a nearly 94 percent stake, VCFs largest owner was ER Illinois LLC, based at the same New York address as Richmond Hill Investment Co., LP, VCFs filing showed. PayplantLLC The Palo Alto, California-based firm was co-founded by Ronjon Nag, an inventor and smartphone pioneer, and Neerav Berry, a computer engineering expert and co-founder of a mobile app store platform acquired by Blackberry. A February 2014 filing with Illinois showed Nag and wife Sally Ann Rudd committing $5 million to Payplant with another $5 million coming from the Berry & Pandey Living Trust. The program targets invoices from contractors providing vital state services 90 or more days overdue. To date, Illinois has designated a variety of vendors, including some that supply state employees and retirees with medical services, feed prison inmates and keep Illinois computer systems functioning. The outside groups front unpaid vendors 90 percent of the face value of their receivables. Whenever Illinois eventually pays those bills, vendors keep the remaining 10 percent of what they are owed, then forward the balance and late-payment penalties to the lenders.

"Trump won with lowest minority vote in decades, fueling divisions","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump won the U.S. presidency with less support from black and Hispanic voters than any president in at least 40 years, a Reuters review of polling data shows, highlighting deep national divisions that have fueled incidents of racial and political confrontation. Trump was elected with 8 percent of the black vote, 28 percent of the Hispanic vote and 27 percent of the Asian-American vote, according to the Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll. Among black voters, his showing was comparable to the 9 percent captured by George W. Bush in 2000 and Ronald Reagan in 1984. But Bush and Reagan both did far better with Hispanic voters, capturing 35 percent and 34 percent, respectively, according to exit polling data compiled by the non-partisan Roper Center for Public Opinion Research.  And Trumps performance among Asian-Americans was the worst of any winning presidential candidate since tracking of that demographic began in 1992. The racial polarization behind Trumps victory has helped set the stage for tensions that have surfaced repeatedly since the election, in white supremacist victory celebrations, in anti-Trump protests and civil rights rallies, and in hundreds of racist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic hate crimes documented by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which tracks extremist movements. The SPLC reports there were 701 incidents of hateful harassment and intimidation between the day following the Nov. 8 election and Nov. 16, with a spike in such incidents in the immediate wake of the vote.    Signs point to an ongoing atmosphere of confrontation.    The Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a white separatist group that vilifies African-Americans, Jews and other minorities, plans an unusual Dec. 3 rally in North Carolina to celebrate Trumps victory. Left-wing and anarchist groups have called for organized protests to disrupt the president-elects Jan. 20 inauguration. And a Womens March on Washington, scheduled for the following day, is expected to draw hundreds of thousands to protest Trumps presidency.    American politics became increasingly racialized through President Barack Obamas two terms, but there was an attempt across the board, across the parties, to keep those tensions under the surface, says Jamila Michener, an assistant professor of government at Cornell University.  Trumps anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim rhetoric brought those divisions to the fore; it activated people on the right, who felt empowered, and it activated people on the left, who saw it as a threat, she added.    That dynamic was evident last week.    When Vice President-elect Mike Pence attended the Broadway musical Hamilton in New York on Friday, the multi-ethnic cast closed with a statement expressing fears of a Trump presidency. A far different view was on display the next day as a crowd of about 275 people cheered Trumps election at a Washington conference of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist group with a strong anti-Semitic beliefs.     We willed Donald Trump into office; we made this dream our reality, NPI President Richard Spencer said. After outlining a vision of America as a white country designed for ourselves and our posterity, he closed with, Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory! Though Trumps election victory was driven by white voters, his performance even among that group was not as strong as some of his predecessors. Reagan and George H.W. Bush both won the presidency with higher shares of the white vote than the 55 percent that Trump achieved.     The historical voting patterns reflect decades of polarization in American politics, but the division surrounding Trump appears more profound, says Cas Mudde, an associate professor specializing in political extremism at the University of Georgia. These days, he adds, people say they dont want their children even to date someone from the other party.    Indeed, voters opinions of those on the opposite side of the partisan divide have reached historic lows. Surveys by the Pew Research Center showed this year that majorities of both parties held very unfavorable views of the other party  a first since the center first measured such sentiment in 1992. And the lions share of those people believe the opposing partys policies are so misguided that they threaten the nations well-being, the center found.    That level of division has spurred activists on both sides of the political divide to take their activism in a more confrontational direction.    In the wake of Trumps victory, protesters on the left took to the streets by the thousands in cities across the country, in some cases causing property damage.  Much of the agitation was motivated by a belief that Trumps administration will foster racism and push the courts and other political institutions to disenfranchise minority voters, says James Anderson, editor of ItsGoingDown.Org, an anarchist website that has promoted mass demonstrations against Trumps presidency, including a call to disrupt his inauguration.    Many on the left have come to distrust government institutions, embracing a breed of activism aimed at directly confronting what they see as condemnable political forces, Anderson says. The answer now is to organize, build power and autonomy and fight back.    On the opposite end of the political spectrum, Trumps election is bringing new hope for right-wing activists who felt abandoned by the major parties.     John Roberts, a top officer in the Ku Klux Klan affiliate planning the December rally to celebrate Trumps election, says the group is committed to non-violent demonstrations, but he sees Trumps election as likely to bring a new era of political conflict. And much of the strife, he says, will be centered around racial divisions.    Once Trump officially takes office, there is going to be a boiling over at some point in time, Roberts says. Who knows when thats going to be, but its not going to be pretty. ",politicsNews,"November 23, 2016 ",1
Trump keeping 'open mind' on pulling out of climate accord,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was keeping an open mind on whether to pull out of a landmark international accord to fight climate change, in a softening of his stance toward global warming. Trump told the New York Times in an interview that he thinks there is some connectivity between human activity and global warming, despite previously describing climate change as a hoax. A source on Trumps transition team told Reuters earlier this month that the New York businessman was seeking quick ways to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat climate change.  But asked on Tuesday whether the United States would withdraw from the accord, the Republican said: Im looking at it very closely. I have an open mind to it.  A U.S. withdrawal from the pact, agreed to by almost 200 countries, would set back international efforts to limit rising temperatures that have been linked to the extinctions of animals and plants, heat waves, floods and rising sea levels.         . Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, also said he was thinking about climate change and American competitiveness and how much it will cost our companies, he said, according to a tweet by a Times reporter in the interview. Two people advising Trumps transition team on energy and environment issues said they were caught off guard by his remarks.  A shift on global warming is the latest sign Trump might be backing away from some of his campaign rhetoric as life in the Oval Office approaches. Trump has said he might have to build a fence, rather than a wall, in some areas of the U.S.-Mexican border to stop illegal immigration, tweaking one of his signature campaign promises. Also in Tuesdays interview, he showed little appetite for pressing investigations of his Democratic rival in the presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton. I dont want to hurt the Clintons, I really dont. She went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways, he told reporters, editors and other newspaper officials at the Times headquarters in Manhattan.  But Trump said no when asked if he would rule out investigating Clinton over her familys charitable foundation or her use of a private email server while she was U.S. secretary of state during President Barack Obamas first term. If Trump does abandon his campaign vow to appoint a special prosecutor for Clinton, it will be a reversal of a position he mentioned almost daily on the campaign trail, when he dubbed his rival Crooked Hillary, and crowds at his rallies often chanted: Lock her up. His comments to the Times about Clinton angered some of his strongest conservative supporters. Breitbart News, the outlet once led by Trumps chief strategist, Steve Bannon, published a story on Tuesday under the headline, Broken Promise: Trump Doesnt Wish to Pursue Clinton email charges. The FBI investigated Clintons email practices, concluding in July that her actions were careless but that there were no grounds for bringing charges.  The Clinton Foundation charity has also been scrutinized for donations it received, but there has been no evidence that foreign donors obtained favors from the State Department while Clinton headed it. Trump, a real estate developer who has never held public office, brushed off fears over conflicts of interest between his job as president and his familys businesses. The laws totally on my side, the president cant have a conflict of interest, he told the New York Times. My companys so unimportant to me relative to what Im doing, Trump said. Conflict-of-interest rules for executive branch employees do not apply to the president, but Trump will be bound by bribery laws, disclosure requirements and a section of the U.S. Constitution that prohibits elected officials from taking gifts from foreign governments, according to Republican and Democratic ethics lawyers. There may be specific laws that dont apply to the president, but the president is not above the law, said Richard Painter of the University of Minnesota, a former associate counsel to Republican President George W. Bush. Do we really want to run our government where you have the president, the leader of the United States and the free world, saying: Im going to do the bare minimum to squeak by? asked Norman Eisen, a former top ethics lawyer in Obamas White House. Trumps businesswoman daughter Ivanka joined her fathers telephone call with Argentine President Mauricio Macri earlier this month and attended a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, raising questions of possible conflicts of interest. When asked whether House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans in Congress would consider his  trillion-dollar infrastructure plan, Trump boasted he was popular with the partys leaders on Capitol Hill.     Right now, theyre in love with me, he said.     Since his Nov. 8 election victory, Trump has been meeting with prospective candidates for top positions in his administration. Ben Carson, a former Republican presidential hopeful who dropped out of the 2016 race and backed Trump, has been offered the post of secretary of housing and urban development, Carson spokesman Armstrong Williams said. Carson, a retired surgeon who met with Trump on Tuesday, will think about it over the Thanksgiving holiday, Williams said. Trump arrived in Florida on Tuesday evening to spend Thursdays holiday at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach.  ",politicsNews,"November 22, 2016 ",1
Ex-CIA boss Petraeus indicates would serve Trump if asked,"LONDON (Reuters) - Retired U.S. general David Petraeus indicated on Wednesday that he would serve in President-elect Donald Trumps administration if he was offered a job, according to an interview on Britains BBC radio. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Petraeus, who resigned as CIA chief in 2012 after an extra-marital affair was revealed, was under consideration for the post of defense secretary. Asked if he would agree to serve in the Trump administration, Petraeus said: Ive been in a position before where a president has turned to me in the Oval Office in a difficult moment and .... said Im asking you as your president and commander-in-chief to take command of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. The only response can be yes, Mr President. Petraeus was a four-star general in the U.S. Army and oversaw international forces in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He was later appointed as CIA director by President Barack Obama. Asked during his BBC interview if he thought Trump had the right temperament to be president, Petraeus said: Were going to have to see. Im not someone whos had contact with him in the past. I dont know how he operates. Its interesting that those who have been talking to him have said hes a very personable, very hospitable, very gracious guy, full of questions and dialogue. This is a guy whos done pretty well in life. Pressed further on the pressures of the office of U.S. president and whether he had confidence that Trump was capable of doing the job, Petraeus said: I think so, yes. Its up to Americans not only to hope that that is the case, but if they can, endeavor to help him. ",politicsNews,"November 23, 2016 ",1

Conservatives bristle as Trump backs off Clinton prosecution,"(Reuters) - Some of Donald Trumps strongest conservative supporters are voicing anger and disappointment at the president-elects comments on Tuesday that he might back off his campaign pledge of pursuing a prosecution of former rival Hillary Clinton.     Trump, in an interview with the New York Times, took a more compassionate tone toward the Democratic presidential nominee than during his campaign, when he talked about a possible criminal investigation of the opponent he dubbed Crooked Hillary if he won the White House.  Chants of Lock her up echoed throughout his campaign rallies, with Trump supporters angrily alleging corruption related to her use of a private email server while secretary of state and to foreign contributions received by the Clinton Foundation charity. She went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways, and I am not looking to hurt them at all. The campaign was vicious, Trump told the Times, adding that launching an investigation was not something I feel very strongly about. Conservatives who had reveled in the possibility of a Clinton prosecution were not pleased. Breitbart News, the outlet once led by Trumps chief strategist, Steve Bannon, published a story on Tuesday under the headline, Broken Promise: Trump Doesnt Wish to Pursue Clinton email charges. Writer and commentator Ann Coulter also balked at the news, tweeting: Whoa! I thought we elected (Trump) president. Did we make him the FBI, & (U.S. Department of Justice)? His job is to pick those guys, not do their jobs. She added no president should block investigators from doing their jobs. Radio personality Rush Limbaugh asked the 2 million people who like his Facebook page for reaction and received more than 2,000 responses, many of which were livid. Donald J. Trump, I am hearing that you will not be pursuing Hillary email scandal and pay-to-play. If that is the case, you just proved to me and America that laws are for the poor people. That Lady Justice is not blind. That you are no different than the swamp you want to drain. If true, you have just spit in my face and so many others, Facebook user Donald Marks wrote. Some Republicans have backed the shift, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a close Trump adviser, who told reporters on Tuesday that while he would have supported an investigation, Trump had to make a tough choice. There is a tradition in American politics that after you win an election, you sort of put things behind you, Giuliani told ABC News. ",politicsNews,"November 23, 2016 ",1

"Willing to oppose Trump, some Senate Republicans gain leverage","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It is no surprise that Democrats in the U.S. Congress will oppose Donald Trump but the most important resistance to fulfilling the president-elects agenda is beginning to emerge from Republicans on Capitol Hill. A small number of influential Republicans in the Senate are threatening to block appointments to Trumps administration, derail his thaw with Russia and prevent the planned wall on the border with Mexico. The party held onto control of the Senate at the Nov. 8 election but by only a thin margin, putting powerful swing votes in just a few hands. That empowers Republican Senate mavericks such as Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas. Both were bitter rivals to Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential primary.  Paul, a libertarian lone wolf, says he will block Senate confirmations if Trump nominates either former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani or former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton to be secretary of state. South Carolinas Lindsay Graham has started publicly outlining places he might be willing to oppose Trump. He is against the Mexican border wall and is delivering warnings against Trumps intention to revoke legal status for undocumented immigrants brought here as children - although that would not require congressional approval.  Graham, a traditional Republican foreign policy hawk, strongly disagrees with Trumps attempt to improve ties with Russia. I am going to be kind of a hard ass on Russia, Graham told reporters recently. We cant sit on the sidelines and let cyber attacks blamed on Russia go unanswered.             The early stirrings of opposition from Senate Republicans are a sign that the New York businessman, who has never held public office, might run into harsh political realities soon after taking office on Jan. 20.         Other Senators who might defy Trump are Arizonas John McCain and Jeff Flake, Nebraskas Ben Sasse, Floridas Marco Rubio, Maines Susan Collins and Alaskas Lisa Murkowski, said senior Senate aides and lawmakers.     These lawmakers have ruffled feathers in the past and some have a good political reason not to fear Trump: Paul, McCain, Murkowski and Rubio do not have to run for reelection until 2022. Graham, Collins and Sasse will have to face the voters in 2020; Cruz and Flake have an earlier election, in 2018. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose job is to keep the Republicans in line, knows the challenges ahead. A senior Republican aide said McConnell is loathe to spend time trying to move bills that lack the needed Senate votes.  McConnell is aware he will not have the support of some of his own lawmakers on bills that could pass the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, such as appropriating money to build the Mexican wall and further abortion restrictions, the aide said. But Trump has a history of taming what appear to be well-entrenched Republican opponents. He won the party nomination against all the odds and some of his staunchest opponents like Rubio and Cruz ended up endorsing him.         And swing votes in the Senate cut two ways. The Democrats have their own potential renegades such as West Virginias Joe Manchin, who has already declared his support for Trumps nomination of Republican Senator Jeff Sessions as attorney general. Such swings by Democrats toward Republicans may be likelier ahead of the 2018 elections, when Democrats must defend more vulnerable Senate seats than Republicans. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer must deal with this. Trump said over the weekend he and Schumer always had a good relationship. Republicans are likely to control only 52 seats in the 100-seat Senate, meaning three defections within the party are enough to block cabinet appointments which only require 50 votes. Vice President-elect Mike Pence would break 50-50 ties. The task for McConnell gets more difficult when it comes to passing legislation, which requires 60 votes, known as cloture, to allow a bill to move forward. If Trump plans to sign a bill while in office, perhaps one that will change immigration law or restrict abortions, McConnell will have to keep all Republicans in line and win over an additional eight Democrats. Trump could deliver on campaign promises that do not require legislative approval like blocking the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal or ending the Iran nuclear pact. The repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, enjoys robust Republican support and would be done through a legislative maneuver that does not require any Democratic support.  Collins and Murkowski have a history of crossing the aisle to join Democrats and could shy from abortion restrictions. Cruz has never feared disrupting Senate business to prove a point or seek concessions in legislation.  Sasse did not waver from his staunch criticism of Trump through the campaign. Flake has said he is eating crow after Trumps win, but he could defect on immigration and border security, issues he has previously joined with Democrats on. Paul was asked last week on MSNBC if he would put a hold on Giuliani or Bolton. In the Senate, a hold allows a single senator to delay a confirmation. He left open the possibility of such a move, saying, I feel pretty strongly about it.  He said: We have a 52-48 majority, all it would take is two or three Republicans to say they cant go along with Giuliani and cant go along with Bolton.     ",politicsNews,"November 22, 2016 ",1

Factbox: Summary of Trump's comments in New York Times interview,"(Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump spoke on a wide range of issues with New York Times editors and reporters on Tuesday. The following is a summary of some of his comments as reported by the newspaper or its reporters. Trump said prosecuting Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for her handing of classified information while secretary of state or the dealings of the Clinton Foundation was not something that I feel very strongly about. I dont want to hurt the Clintons, I really dont, Trump said. She went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways. I think it would be very very divisive for the country, he said, referring to prosecuting Clinton or her husband, former President Bill Clinton. During campaign rallies, Trump often fired up his supporters by calling for pressing for investigations of Hillary Clinton, spurring chants of Lock her up! by the crowd. Trump, who previously called man-made global warming a hoax, said: I think there is some connectivity between humans and climate change. Im looking at it very closely, Trump said about the 2015 Paris climate accord, which he had promised to quit during the presidential campaign. I have an open mind to it. * ALT-RIGHT AND STEVE BANNON Trump condemned an alt-right conference in Washington over the weekend where some members performed a Hitler salute and yelled: Hail Trump! after a speech about white nationalism. I condemn them. I disavow, and I condemn, he said. Its not a group I want to energize. And if they are energized I want to look into it and find out why. Rejecting charges by some critics that his chief White House strategist Steve Bannon is a racist, Trump said: Ive known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist, or alt-right ... I wouldnt even think about hiring him. Critics say Bannon, a former head of the conservative Breitbart News, had made the website a forum for the alt-right, a loose grouping that rejects mainstream politics and includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. The real estate mogul said he saw no conflict in his business dealings and being president. In theory I could run my business perfectly and then run the country perfectly. Theres never been a case like this, Trump said. Id assumed that youd have to set up some type of trust or whatever and you dont, he said. But he added: I would like to do something.  The laws totally on my side, the president cant have a conflict of interest. * DEALING WITH THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT Trump said his son-in-law and close aide, Jared Kushner, could help broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and that the president-elect himself could play a role in achieving what has eluded his predecessors. I would love to be the one who made peace with Israel and the Palestinians, Trump said. That would be such a great achievement. ",politicsNews,"November 22, 2016 ",1
North Carolina governor requests vote recount in tight race,"(Reuters) - North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory announced on Tuesday he has officially requested a recount of votes from the Nov. 8 election with official results showing him trailing his Democratic challenger, Attorney General Roy Cooper, by one-tenth of a point. The gubernatorial race in the ninth largest U.S. state remained undecided two weeks after Election Day. Officials with the State Board of Elections were continually updating results as they arrived from the state's 100 counties. (For official results see: bit.ly/2fV0APx) A recount is mandatory if the margin is less than 10,000 votes once all 100 counties have finished their canvasses, a spokesman for the election board said. As of Tuesday afternoon, Coopers lead was 6,187 out of 4.7 million votes cast.  The election had been widely seen as a referendum on McCrorys support for a state law denying transgender people the right to use the public bathroom matching their gender identities, instead forcing them to use those corresponding to the gender assigned at birth. The law led to widespread boycotting of North Carolina by entertainers such as Bruce Springsteen and Itzhak Perlman while sports organizations such as the National Basketball Association and the National Collegiate Athletic Association moved major events out of state.  McCrory's request came in a letter to the election board dated Friday and made public on Tuesday. (For a copy of the letter, see: bit.ly/2f3JfEE) McCrorys campaign has questioned the validity of the posted results, saying Coopers total may be inflated by votes from dead people or felons ineligible to cast a ballot. With serious concerns of potential voter fraud emerging across the state, it is becoming more apparent that a thorough recount is one way the people of North Carolina can have confidence in the results, process and system, McCrory said. Cooper, however, has already claimed victory. This is nothing but a last-ditch effort from Governor McCrory to delay and deny the results of this election, Cooper campaign manager Trey Nix said in a statement. Roy Cooper leads by 8,569 votes  a number that is growing daily as counties finalize election results. We are confident that a recount will do nothing to change the fact that Roy Cooper has won this election. The Cooper campaign said it came to its larger vote margin by citing election observers in each county who have tallied numbers not yet uploaded onto the election board site.

"Trump sinks Asia trade pact, opening the way for China to lead","TOKYO/SYDNEY (Reuters) - An ambitious Asia-Pacific trade pact linking the United States and 11 countries lay in tatters on Tuesday after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said he would kill the deal on his first day in office on Jan. 20. Trumps statement appeared to open the way for China to assume the United States leadership mantle on trade and diplomacy in Asia. The Republican termed the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) a potential disaster for our country. China, Japan and South Korea are already in the initial stages of discussing a trilateral trade deal, and Beijing has been pushing its own limited Asian regional trade pact that excludes Washington for the past five years. Japan and Australia, Washingtons closest allies in Asia, pledged after Trumps announcement to push ahead without the United States, although removing the largest market for goods and services would shrink it dramatically. Pushing them forward is the idea that, if they dont act, it will look like Chinas very weak trade deals are the only game in town, said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, where he focuses on Asian economies and trade. Trump has pledged to redraw trade deals to win back American jobs, and has threatened Mexico and China with punitive tariffs in a move that some economists have warned could spark a trade war that threatens to roll back decades of liberalization. Ending the TPP was a key election pledge of Trumps and was also the policy of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. The deal died in Congress after Trumps Nov. 8 election victory. The Trans Pacific Partnership, a signature diplomatic initiative of Democratic President Barack Obama, was intended to lower tariff barriers in countries that accounted for 40 percent of the world economy, as well as providing a bulwark against China. A major trade deal between the United States and Europe is also now close to collapse after Britains plans to withdraw from the European Union prompted Washington to demand better terms and opposition in France and Germany has also all but scuppered it. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the TPP would be meaningless without the United States, even as parliament continued debating ratification and his government vowed to lobby other members to approve it.  It (the pact) just continues in a state of not being in effect, said Shinpei Sasaki of the Cabinet Offices TPP headquarters. Australian Trade Minister Steven Ciobo told reporters in Canberra that countries could push ahead with the TPP without the United States by amending the agreement and possibly adding new members.  We could look at, for example, if China or Indonesia or another country wanted to join, saying, Yes, we open the door for them signing up to the agreement as well. But Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said reopening negotiations would not be easy. If you sign a fresh agreement, you have to go through it again. We havent crossed that bridge yet. Well cross it if and when we come to that. China has pushed its own Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which notably excludes the United States. It is a more traditional trade agreement, involving cutting tariffs rather than opening up economies and setting labor and environmental standards as TPP would. The RCEP was a focus of attention at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru over the weekend. Tan Jian, a senior member of Chinas delegation at the summit, said more countries are now seeking to join its 16-member bloc, including Peru and Chile, and current members want to reach a deal as soon as possible to counter rising protectionism. Chinas foreign ministry said on Tuesday that Beijing has an open attitude toward any arrangements that promote free trade in the region as long they dont become fragmented and  politicized. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the RCEP was an initiative led by the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which China has been promoting. We are willing to keep pushing the (RCEP) talks process with all sides to achieve positive progress at an early date, he said.  Vietnam last week shelved its own ratification of TPP, after Obama abandoned efforts to push it through a lame-duck Congress, while Malaysia has shifted its attention to the RCEP. At a U.S.-China agricultural trade seminar in Washington, senior Obama administration officials and their Chinese counterparts appeared to ignore the elephant in the room: the collapse of TPP and Trumps tough trade talk against China. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said he was focused in a U.S.-China trade negotiators meeting in Washington this week on reducing Chinas regulatory and food safety barriers to American beef, poultry and genetically modified crops out of China. There hasnt been a discussion about the future, theres really a focus on the present, Vilsack said when asked about what he was telling his Chinese counterparts about the risks posed by an incoming Trump administration. Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang did not address Trumps trade rhetoric at the discussion in Washington, but warned that a closing of agricultural trade would be unacceptable to our farmers. China is one of the most important markets for agricultural exports, accounting for nearly a fifth of U.S. agricultural exports. ... On average, every U.S. farmer exports about $12,000 of agricultural products to China every year, Wang said. ",politicsNews,"November 22, 2016 ",1
Chinese official optimistic about US trade amid Trump uncertainty,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang said on Tuesday that U.S. policies toward China under President-elect Donald Trump may be uncertain, but he is optimistic because of the U.S. business communitys enthusiasm for U.S.-China trade. At a luncheon with U.S. and Chinese business people and government officials, Wang said he believed that businesses and the U.S. government would ultimately make the right choices to take advantage of market opportunities in Chinas economy. What the U.S. government will do we will wait and see, and I think its difficult to predict, just like the U.S. presidential election, Wang said through an interpreter. The large crowd here tells us one thing. Although there will be a change in the U.S. government, the passion of the U.S. business community for economic cooperation with China has remained unchanged. Two weeks after Trumps stunning election on the back of anti-trade sentiment among workers in U.S. industrial states, the president-elects plans for managing tense relations with China remain unclear. On the campaign trail, Trump had said China is killing us on trade. He threatened to declare Beijing a currency manipulator, levy a 45 percent punitive tariff on all Chinese goods to reduce a massive U.S. trade deficit with China and pull out of the World Trade Organization, the global trade body that allowed China to join in 2001.     As he builds his administration, Trump has added some harsh critics of Chinas trade practices to his transition team, including Dan DiMicco, a former chief executive officer of steel giant Nucor Corp (NUE.N) and Washington trade lawyer Robert Lighthizer, a former trade negotiator during the Ronald Reagan administration.     Wang made his remarks at the start of a round of talks of the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT), which include officials from the two countries who focus on technical issues such as safety and regulatory approvals that can become barriers to trade. Wang said the JCCT and other forums such as the cabinet-level Strategic and Economic Dialogue talks promoted by the Obama administration have helped to reduce trade tensions between the worlds two largest economies.    Wang also said China would continue to offer major opportunities to American companies, including buying more than $8 trillion in total imports over the next five years. China also anticipates $500 billion in foreign direct investment from all countries and investing $720 billion overseas, while 600 million Chinese are expected to travel overseas in the same period, he said. This will generate enormous business opportunities for the companies of all countries including the United States, Wang said. I think in the face of a emerging big market like China, the American companies and government will make the right choices.     Major problems in the U.S.-China relationship would be bad for both economies as well as the global economy, he added. ",politicsNews,"November 22, 2016 ",1
"Italy to push Iran trade ties, undaunted by Trump","ROME (Reuters) - Italys industry minister pledged on Tuesday to support business deals with Iran potentially worth billions of dollars, undeterred by fears U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could put slowly thawing international relations back on ice. Iran re-joined the global trading system in January after a multilateral deal between world powers, and Italian firms eagerly started drawing up commercial agreements.     Trump has raised the prospect the United States could pull out of the pact, which lifted many sanctions in exchange for limiting the Islamic Republics nuclear ambitions, leaving European diplomats fearing the change of leadership at the White House could thwart growing trade. But Italian Industry Minister Carlo Calenda said he would continue to work to strengthen trade ties, and travel to Iran in early 2017 along with Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan.  The issue of funding investment, which Tehran complains has been held up by continued U.S. sanctions restricting Irans access to the international banking and financial system, would be high on the agenda, he said.                  The central issue is to make financing channels work fully, so that all the good projects we have can become reality, Calenda said at a trade fair in Rome for Iranian companies. Calenda said it was too early to say how the picture could change under Trumps leadership, but in the interests of the countries involved I think there is the absolute necessity to implement the (nuclear) agreement and move forward that way. Asked whether any of the collaboration agreements made so far, which have involved oil services group Saipem (SPMI.MI) and steel firm Danieli (DANI.MI), were at risk, Calenda said: No, I dont think so. Iran denies that its nuclear program has military aims.  ",politicsNews,"November 22, 2016 ",1
Obama's not-so-secret admirer: Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama has a new fan: Donald Trump. After lambasting Obama for months as a failed leader unfit to be president, the Republican president-elect found kinder words on Tuesday for the man he will succeed in the White House on Jan. 20 I didnt know if Id like him. I probably thought that maybe I wouldnt, but I did. I really enjoyed him a lot, Trump said in an interview with the New York Times. Obama, a Democrat, met with Trump at the Oval Office on Nov. 10, two days after the presidential election. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said earlier on Tuesday the two had spoken again since then, citing Obamas commitment to a smooth transfer of power, but offered no other details.  I had a great meeting with President Obama, Trump told the Times. I really liked him a lot. Obama, who had his own harsh words for Trump as he campaigned for Democrat Hillary Clinton, has made clear he would put the bitterness of the campaign aside to ensure a smooth transition of power and protect a pillar of American democracy. Trump told the newspaper that Obama talked to him about what he considered the countrys biggest problems, one problem in particular that the president-elect did not mention, according to Twitter posts by Times reporters. Trump, who has vowed to undo a number of initiatives Obama holds dear, appeared conciliatory toward the president whose U.S. citizenship he had long questioned. He said very nice things after the meeting and I said very nice things about him, Trump said of Obama, according to the Times. ",politicsNews,"November 22, 2016 ",1
Peru proposes talks to save TPP after Trump firms up opposition,"LIMA (Reuters) - Peru proposed new talks to ensure the U.S.-proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership will be implemented after Donald Trump vowed to withdraw the United States from the sweeping trade deal on the first day of his administration. Trade Minister Eduardo Ferreyros, who last week urged the world not to box in Trump on his campaign stance toward the TPP, said the U.S. President-elects comments on Monday had dramatically changed the panorama. But in my opinion it doesnt kill it. We can work on it, change it so its implementation does not hinge on U.S. ratification, Ferreyros said in an interview late on Monday with local TV channel Canal N. The TPP, signed by the United States, Peru and 10 other Pacific rim countries early this year, was written so it cannot go into effect without ratification from the United States, which has framed the pact as a way to counter Chinas rise in the fast-growing Asia Pacific. We can modify that clause and also take advantage to modify other clauses that might be uncomfortable for us, said Ferreyros. Asked if China could join the TPP, Ferreyros said yes but that Beijing would have to show interest first. China has been promoting a rival regional free trade deal, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), that includes India but is not expected to include steep tariff reductions or strong protections for workers, the environment or intellectual property, according to the administration of outgoing U.S. President Barack Obama. Beijing said Sunday that high standards in multilateral trade deals discourages participation from developing economies. On Tuesday, Peru announced it had signed a memorandum of understanding with China to work on an update of their 6-year-old bilateral free trade deal, which currently excludes textile and garment sectors. Trump, who has described multilateral free trade deals as bad for U.S. manufacturing jobs, on Monday formally declared his intent to withdraw from the deal on his first day in office, appearing to open a path for China to assume the leadership mantle on trade and diplomacy in Asia.

Trump’s foundation says it violated 'self-dealing' ban: IRS forms,"(Reuters) - U.S. Republican President-elect Donald Trumps charitable foundation said it violated a ban on so-called self-dealing by transferring income or assets to a disqualified person, according to a copy of its 2015 tax filings made public this week. The Donald J. Trump Foundations Internal Revenue Service forms, first reported by The Washington Post on Tuesday, showed that the organization said yes when asked if it had transferred any income or assets to a disqualified person. Asked if it had violated the ban on so-called self-dealing in prior years, the foundation also said yes, according to the forms, also viewed by Reuters.  According to the IRS, self-dealing can include the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of a disqualified person of the asset of a foundation, except for certain exemptions. On the forms, Trumps foundation said yes when asked if any of the income or assets transfers failed to qualify as IRS exemptions.   The 30-page filing was signed by the foundations treasurer, Donald Bender, but not dated, and it was unclear whether they had been filed with the IRS. Representatives for Trump and the foundation did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The forms were posted late on Monday on the website for Guidestar, which tracks nonprofit organizations, according to the Post, which also said it could not confirm whether the forms had actually been sent to the IRS. On Oct. 4, New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ordered the foundation to immediately stop fundraising in the state, accusing it of having violated a state law requiring charitable organizations that solicit outside donations to register with his offices Charities Bureau.  The order followed a series of reports in the Post that suggested improprieties by the foundation, including using its funds to settle legal disputes involving Trump businesses. The Post said Trump might have violated IRS rules against self-dealing by using foundation money to purchase two portraits of himself, which were then hung at his private golf clubs in New York and Florida. Trumps campaign suggested that the probe launched by Schneiderman, a Democrat, was politically motivated.",politicsNews,"November 22, 2016 ",1

"Mexico sees trade deals in TPP leftovers, flags China opportunity","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico said on Tuesday the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) could form the basis for bilateral trade deals between signatories, and saw a bigger role for China on world trade after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump vowed to withdraw from the accord. On Monday, Trump set out plans for his first day in office, including withdrawing from TPP. He called it a potential disaster for the United States, which he argues has lost thousands of manufacturing jobs due to poor trade policy. Mexicos Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo, who has just returned from meetings with policymakers at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Lima, said if Washington stepped back from free trade, it would open the door to China. If one power exits a space, you can bet another will step in, he told reporters at an event in Mexico City. Chinese President Xi Jinping also attended the APEC meeting, where he told the world here we are on free trade and pledged to keep opening its economy to other countries, Guajardo said. Mexico has said it wants to press ahead with TPP regardless of whether the United States ratifies the 12 nation accord signed in February, though Guajardo said the existing agreement could form the basis for bilateral deals. The minister also said Mexico could weigh the merits of the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a rival pact that excludes the United States. Mexico has to have a means of integrating itself with the Asia-Pacific (region), Guajardo said. Trump has also threatened to ditch the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between Mexico, United States and Canada, raising pressure on Mexico to reduce dependency on the United States, where it sends 80 percent of its goods exports. Latin Americas second biggest economy runs a sizeable trade deficit with Asias main trading nations, especially China. However, the government could face resistance from Mexican manufacturers to opening up to China, as the two countries compete directly in many sectors to export to the United States.

"Chile's foreign minister: TPP not dead, despite Trump comments","SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Countries involved in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact will continue working to bring a deal to fruition despite a pledge by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to withdraw from the accord, Chiles foreign minister said on Tuesday. Whether it be with the United States or without the United States, theres a willingness among the countries that make up the TPP to move forward, Heraldo Munoz told a news conference ahead of a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to the South American nation. Whether its to be the same framework as the current TPP, that remains to be seen. On Monday, Trump released a video pledging to withdraw from the TPP on his first day in office, calling it a potential disaster for the United States.  World leaders have had varying reactions to Trumps comments, with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saying during a visit to Buenos Aires that U.S. abandonment of the deal would render it meaningless. The future of the 12-nation deal, which does not include China, was one of the key themes of summit talks between leaders of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies in Lima in recent days. There is debate over to what extent a U.S.-free TPP might  advance without a complete renegotiation. China has been pushing its own alternative trade pact, which excludes the Americas, although it has said other countries including Chile are interested in joining. The Chinese premier was due to arrive in Santiago on Tuesday, where he will meet with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet and speak at the United Nations Latin American arm, ECLAC. Munoz said China and Chile plan to sign an agreement to deepen bilateral trade ties during Xis visit. In a column in national newspaper El Mercurio published on Tuesday, Xi wrote that Chile and China should work together to facilitate free trade and business ties in areas such as mining, agriculture, infrastructure, telecommunications, clean energy and IT.

Trump's daughter Ivanka joined call with Argentina's Macri,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Ivanka Trump, daughter of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, briefly joined her fathers telephone call with Argentine President Mauricio Macri earlier this month, Macris spokesman said on Tuesday. The two men spoke on Nov. 14, making Macri one of few Latin American leaders who had spoken with Trump in the days following his surprise victory in the U.S. presidential election. The call was aimed at rekindling a relationship formed when they worked as businessmen before entering politics.     At the end of the presidents call with Trump, the phone was passed to Ivanka so he could say hello. They have known each other since she was quite young, the spokesman said in an emailed response to a question about the call from Reuters. The congratulatory call was aimed at re-establishing the personal bond that the two men formed while doing business together, Argentine Foreign Minister Susana Malcorra said, although Macri had publicly expressed his preference for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. The Macri spokesman denied reports in the Argentine press on Monday that during the call Trump mentioned a pending office tower project that the real estate mogul has been trying to get approved by city regulators in Buenos Aires.  Photographs taken inside a meeting room at Trump Tower last week showed Trump was also accompanied by Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner when he met with Japans Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The son of one of the richest men in Argentina, Macri ended 12 years of leftist rule in Latin Americas third-largest economy when he took office last December. He was one of the regional presidents who have worked hardest to improve relations with the United States under President Barack Obama. Macri met Trump decades ago while working for his father, Francisco Macri. According to a book by the elder Macri, his son beat Trump in a golf game during a complicated real estate deal in New York in the 1980s, and Trump broke his clubs after the game in frustration.

Britain to Trump: 'No vacancy' for Farage as ambassador,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain on Tuesday dismissed U.S. President-elect Donald Trumps unprecedented expression of support for Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage to be made British ambassador to Washington, saying pointedly that there is no vacancy for the job. Trump, who after his election victory met Farage before any EU leaders, said on Twitter that many people would like to see the former metals trader turned politician as Britains ambassador. Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job! Trump said. Prime Minister Theresa May, who congratulated Trump on his victory, was swift to reject such an undiplomatic proposal, with a spokesman saying Britain already had an excellent ambassador to Washington and that London would appoint its own envoys. We have first rate ambassador in Washington, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who campaigned for Brexit, told the British parliament. There is no vacancy for that position. It is highly unusual in the modern era for leaders to publicly suggest to foreign nations whom they would like to see as ambassador, though during strained relations they sometimes reject or expel envoys. Trumps suggestion provoked anger, support and even hilarity in Britain, with one lawmaker, Conservative Simon Burns, joking  that perhaps Britain should suggest Hillary Clinton as its preferred choice as ambassador to London. But the apparent public suggestion about who to appoint as ambassador by the man who will lead Britains most powerful ally puts Prime Minister May in a difficult position just as she tries to build ties with Washington ahead of leaving the EU. London is trying to gauge whether Trump would support a special trade deal with Britain as it negotiates a divorce from the EU. Britain also places great store on what it calls its special relationship with the United States. Farage, who spent decades campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union and helped force former Prime Minister David Cameron to call the June referendum that brought the Brexit vote, spoke at a Trump rally during the U.S. campaign and visited the president-elect after his victory. As leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and one of the key figures of the successful Brexit campaign, Farage has repeatedly angered EU leaders by predicting the collapse of the EU, which he says is run by an out-of-touch elite of idiots. Farage said Trumps suggestion that he serve as ambassador had come like a bolt from the blue but Trump understood loyalty in a way that those in the cesspit of career politics did not.  I am in a good position with the President-elects support to help. The world has changed and its time that Downing Street did too, Farage said in an article written for the Breitbart news website. I would do anything to help our national interest and to help cement ties with the incoming Anglophile administration, Farage said. A photograph of Trump greeting Farage in front of a gilded elevator shortly after the U.S. election caused consternation in EU capitals, many of whom view Trump with a mixture of fear and puzzlement. His suggestion of Farage also provoked anger among some British lawmakers. Many people think you should mind your own business and talk about pussy-grabbing less, but hey, life is a constant disappointment, Jess Phillips, a lawmaker for the opposition Labour Party, said on Twitter in a reference to Trumps previous vulgar comments about groping women.  Accused by his critics of being a racist and a bigot, Farage peppers his speeches with jokes and the odd expletive while railing against what he calls the doomed European superstate and immigration into Britain. He is a member of the European parliament but has failed in his efforts to win election to the British parliament. Farage said Trump would be a great president after the political revolution that brought Brexit in Britain and Trump to power in the United States. In the United Kingdom the people have spoken but the players at the top have, I am afraid, stayed the same, Farage, 52, said.  Those who supported Remain now hold senior positions. Worst still, those who were openly abusive about Trump now pretend to be his friend, said Farage.  Farage has urged May to build ties with Trump, who provoked criticism in Britain with his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. Queen Elizabeth might invite Trump for a state visit to Britain next year. Farage made light of allegations of sexual assault against Trump during the U.S. campaign by encouraging him to come and schmooze May but adding dont touch her for goodness sake. When U.S. President Barack Obama said before the referendum that Britain would be at the back of the queue for a trade deal, Farage said it was disgraceful to intervene in the sovereign affairs of Britain.  In a radio interview after the U.S. election, Farage described the U.S. president as: That Obama creature  a loathsome individual who couldnt stand our country. The way ambassadors are chosen in the United States and Europe differ significantly. It is common practice for the United States to appoint celebrities or campaign donors as envoys, for example when Richard Nixon appointed Shirley Temple as his envoy to Ghana in 1974. European states mostly appoint career diplomats or officials with long experience as ambassadors. Kim Darroch, the current British ambassador in Washington, did not reply to emails from Reuters requesting comment on Trumps remarks. His email bounced back with an out of office reply saying that the ambassador was traveling.   ",politicsNews,"November 22, 2016 ",1
Should I stay or should I go? U.S. civil servants gird for Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps surprise victory in the U.S. presidential election has set off a round of resume-polishing across Washington, as the nations federal civil servants prepare for a leader who has promised to freeze hiring and reverse many of the policies they have spent the past eight years putting in place.  While anti-Washington rhetoric is a staple of U.S. politics, more than two dozen federal workers interviewed by Reuters said Trumps divisive presidential campaign pointed to bigger potential problems than those that would normally come with a routine switch from a Democratic to a Republican administration.     The New York businessmans lack of political experience and contentious rhetoric have prompted some to assess whether they should leave government before he takes office on Jan. 20.     As the Republican presidential candidate, Trump encouraged his supporters to harass journalists and attack protesters. He vowed to sue news outlets and women who accused him of sexual assault and said he would jail his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trumps conduct has caused some undercover agents to worry that their identities could be made public if they step out of line, said Susan Hennessey, a former attorney at the National Security Agency who has been urging people in government to keep working in Trumps administration to help resist potential abuses of power. I cant and dont blame anyone who feels they cant stay, she said. Other federal workers worry their integrity could be compromised if they work on cases that affect Trumps vast business interests. Trumps taxes are being audited by the Internal Revenue Service and the National Labor Relations Board is involved in a labor dispute at his Las Vegas hotel. Changes to tax laws or pollution rules could potentially impact some of his property holdings. Do I get out or is it all the more important that I stay in to push back on the problematic things? said one federal worker, who, like others interviewed for this story, asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation at work. A transfer of power always convulses Washington to some degree, particularly when it comes to the departure and arrival of political appointees in more than 4,000 posts. Those top officials oversee 2.7 million civilian workers, from park rangers to tax lawyers, who are expected to enact the presidents agenda and enforce laws passed by Congress regardless of their personal political views. But several workers told Reuters theyd rather leave government service than carry out orders they dont agree with, pointing specifically at Trumps vow to undo President Barack Obamas policies on trade, immigration, health care and environmental protection.  National security officials have printed out their resignation letters, ready to hand them in if Trump tries to revive policies such as waterboarding or mass surveillance of Americans they oppose on legal or moral grounds, according to  more than 20 military, intelligence and Foreign Service officers, who all spoke on condition of anonymity. Regulators at the Environmental Protection Agency privately say they are looking for new jobs ahead of expected cutbacks at their agency, whose climate-change rules were criticized by Trump on the campaign trail.  One manager is urging employees to stay on the job. Sometimes democracy surprises you.  And while the election results will no doubt bring many changes over the coming months, our job remains the same, Sarah Dunham, director of the Environmental Protection Agencys Office of Atmospheric Programs, wrote to colleagues two days after the election. Misgivings apparently extend into the nations 1.5 million military service members as well. A survey released by the Military Times on Friday found that one in five service members said they will not re-enlist with Trump as Commander-in-chief. During his campaign, Trump promised to rescind two regulations for every new one his administration issues and freeze hiring at agencies that dont cover public safety, public health or national defense. Republicans in Congress have pushed to erode job protections and scale back benefits. That would be a further blow for federal workers who have weathered furloughs, salary freezes and a three-week government shutdown in recent years. The civilian work force has shrunk by 4 percent since Obamas first year in office, according to White House figures, and it could shrink further. More than one-third of federal workers will be eligible for retirement next year, according to a 2014 Government Accountability Office report. This isnt the worst thing thats happened to us, said a scientist who manages a fisheries laboratory in the Pacific Northwest of the expected changes. Its kind of continual. There may be a silver lining for those who are trying to get a job working for Uncle Sam. Trump has promised to increase the number of border-security agents and immigration-enforcement officers as part of a crackdown on illegal immigration. And several managers said they were rushing to fill vacancies on their teams before Trumps promised hiring ban takes effect.  Everybody seems to be scrambling to fill the positions they have open now, one said. ",politicsNews,"November 22, 2016 ",1
Britain's Johnson: We will stress importance of free trade and NATO to Trump,"LONDON (Reuters) - Foreign minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday Britain must underline the importance of free trade and the NATO military alliance to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump as the government looks to build a relationship with his administration. It is of course vital that we get over the message that NATO and Article 5 of NATO has been the guarantor of peace and stability in our continent for the last 70 years, Johnson said. That is a point, I think, that is well understood in Washington, but which we will repeat. He also said it was vital to get over the importance of trade, free enterprise and of sticking up for the values that I believe unite our two countries. ",politicsNews,"November 22, 2016 ",1
"'We appoint our ambassadors', says UK PM's spokesman","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has an incredibly strong and enduring relationship with the United States and will build on it when Donald Trump takes office as president, a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said on Tuesday. Trump said on Twitter that many people would like to see Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage as British ambassador to Washington, a break with usual diplomatic protocol and an appeal that was quickly dismissed by British officials. We have an excellent ambassador to the United States and he will continue in his work, the spokesman told reporters, pointing out the ambassador only took office this year and normally the job is held for at least four years. We appoint our ambassadors, he added. ",politicsNews,"November 22, 2016 ",1

People can say what they like but the simple truth is theres no vacancy. The ambassador there is very very good, as weve seen, Davis told the BBC. We believe in free speech - we have a very good ambassador in Washington, Kim Darroch, and hell be there for years, Davis said. Darroch did not reply to requests for comment.

U.S. Holocaust museum alarmed over 'hateful speech' by white nationalists,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum expressed alarm on Monday over hateful speech at a white nationalist meeting over the weekend, and a restaurant apologized for hosting the group after a woman tweeted a picture of herself making a Nazi salute. The National Policy Institute, a think tank that is part of the alt-right movement that includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites, held a gathering at the federally owned Ronald Reagan Building on Saturday. The alt-right movement came to the fore during the U.S. presidential election. President-elect Donald Trump has drawn criticism for naming Steve Bannon, former head of a website linked to the alt-right, as his chief White House strategist.  Trumps transition team issued a statement on Monday saying Trump has continued to denounce racism, CNN reported. President-elect Trump has continued to denounce racism of any kind and he was elected because he will be a leader for every American, Trump-Pence Transition spokesman Bryan Lanza said in a statement.  The gathering on Saturday drew scores of protesters who blocked traffic around the building to express their outrage over the meeting.  A video by The Atlantic taken inside the conference showed Richard Spencer, leader of the National Policy Institute, shouting, Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory! as some of the people in attendance lifted their hands in a Nazi salute. The Holocaust did not begin with killings: it began with words, the Holocaust Memorial Museum said in a statement. The museum calls on all American citizens, our religious and civic leaders and the leadership of all branches of the government to confront racist thinking and divisive hateful speech. Some of those who attended the nationalist meeting later gathered for a banquet at Maggianos Little Italy restaurant in northwest Washington. Protesters converged on the site and prompted the restaurant to close to protect the safety of staff and guests, the management said in an apology on Facebook. The restaurant said the booking was a last-minute affair made under a different name, so staff were unaware that the National Policy Institute was dining there and did not know what the group represented. After the event, an attendee sent a tweet in which she made a Seig Heil salute in support of Hitler and white supremacy. This expression of support of Hitler is extremely offensive to us, as our restaurant is home to teammates and guests of every race, religion and cultural background, the Facebook post said. The restaurant apologized to the surrounding neighborhood and said it was donating the profits from its sales on Friday, $10,000, to the Washington office of the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights group. The Ronald Reagan Building, the biggest structure in the U.S. capital city, is federally owned, but run by Trade Center Management Associates, a unit of Drew Co., a Boston real estate development company. The firm defended allowing the nationalist group to use the venue. It said in a statement that its contract mandates that unless there is a security threat by an organization or person who asks for meeting space, the building is available for rental. The agenda of the National Policy Institutes Saturday meeting included a breakdown of the 2016 election and plans for the growth of the alt-right. The nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, described Spencer as an academic racist who backs creation of an Aryan homeland. Twitter Inc suspended several accounts linked to the alt-right last week, including Spencers.  The move followed the microblogging services announcement that it would upgrade some features to better combat cyber-bullying. ",politicsNews,"November 22, 2016 ",1
Court says Republican gerrymandering in Wisconsin was unconstitutional,"MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - Republicans in Wisconsin tilted district maps in their favor in order to hamper Democrats and ultimately win state elections in 2012 and 2014, a federal court said on Monday in a case that could influence future rulings on gerrymandering. The United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin decided 2-1 that Act 43, a redrawing of districts approved by the states Republican-led legislature in 2012, violated the U.S. Constitution, court documents showed.  We find that the discriminatory effect is not explained by the political geography of Wisconsin nor is it justified by a legitimate state interest, the court wrote in its ruling. The case has no bearing on Donald Trumps victory in Wisconsin in the presidential election on Nov. 8, in which he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel said in a statement that he planned to appeal, which would send the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. A ruling there on gerrymandering - the practice of manipulating electoral boundaries for political advantage - could have wide implications across the country as similar cases in Maryland and North Carolina work their way through lower courts.     This is a big victory for those who want to see courts rein in partisan gerrymandering. But it is anybodys guess what happens to this when it gets to the Supreme Court, wrote Richard Hasen, an elections law expert at the University of California, Irvine, on his blog. Since 2010, Republicans have more than doubled their control of state legislatures. They now control both legislative chambers in a record 32 states, the New York Times reported. Republicans win elections because we have better candidates and a better message that continues to resonate with the voters, said Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos in a statement. Twelve Wisconsin voters argued in their lawsuit that Republicans redrew maps in 2011 to divide Democratic voters so they fall short of a majority in districts and to concentrate Democratic voters into districts so they win by overwhelming margins and dilute votes of Democrats statewide, according to the ruling.   Despite receiving 51 percent of the votes statewide in 2012, Democrats won only 39 of 99 Assembly seats. In 2014, Republicans won roughly the same percentage of votes statewide, but won 63 seats, a 24-seat disparity, judges wrote.  The Wisconsin case hinged on a new way to measure the discriminatory effect of gerrymandering. The efficiency gap measure found the redistricting in Wisconsin caused Democrats to waste more votes than Republicans.     The measure gives judges a clear threshold for deciding what is acceptable, Barry Burden, the director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told the New York Times.

UKIP's Farage: I can help UK build ties with Trump,"LONDON (Reuters) - Leading Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage said on Tuesday he was in a good position to help Britain build ties with Donald Trump after the U.S. President-elect tweeted that Farage should be British ambassador to Washington. I have known several of the Trump team for years and I am in a good position with the President-elects support to help, Farage, leader of the opposition UK Independence Party (UKIP), wrote in a column for the Breitbart website. The world has changed and its time that Downing Street did too, he said, referring to Prime Minister Theresa Mays office. Downing Street earlier said there was no vacancy for an ambassador to the United States and an excellent one was already in place. Trump, who after his election victory met Farage ahead of any EU leaders, had said on Twitter that many people would like to see the UKIP leader, who is on very bad terms with the ruling Conservatives, as Britains ambassador.

"Trump's NAFTA revamp would require concessions, may borrow from TPP","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trumps plan to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to make it a lot better for U.S. workers would not be a one-way street for his administration, as Canada and Mexico prepare their own list of demands that could require difficult U.S. concessions. The 22-year-old NAFTA and other trade deals became lightning rods for voter anger in the U.S. industrial heartland states that swept Trump to power this month.  Trump  who on Monday vowed to file notice of his intent to quit an Asia-Pacific trade deal on his first day in office  has pledged to leave NAFTA if it cant be improved to his liking. But he has said little about what improvements he wants, apart from halting the migration of U.S. factories and jobs to Mexico. Trade experts, academics and government officials say Canada and Mexico would also seek tough concessions and that NAFTAs zero-tariff rate would be extremely difficult to alter. And any renegotiation would likely take several years. In a renegotiation, one side can come in with requests, but the other side is going to expect concessions, said Wendy Cutler, a former deputy U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). We need to know what were going to ask for and what we can give. When Cutler helped renegotiate a stalled trade deal with South Korea in 2010, USTR won concessions for U.S. automakers, but at the expense of a longer phase-out on steep Korean pork tariffs and allowing Korea to largely maintain a health care reimbursement system that favors domestic generic drugmakers. Trump, who during the campaign called NAFTA the worst trade deal ever and threatened to levy a 35-percent tariff on Mexican-assembled autos and other goods, would have a hard time raising U.S. tariffs without scrapping the agreement, trade experts say. There is no precedent in free trade negotiations for one side raising tariffs more than the other, said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics in Washington. If U.S. workers are more expensive than Mexican workers, the only way to level the playing field is to do things that raise costs in Mexico, Bown said.   Negotiating stronger environmental and labor protections would be one way of doing this, as it would increase manufacturing costs in a lower-income country like Mexico. The Trump transition leader for trade, Dan Dimicco, declined Reuters requests for comment. DiMicco, who is under consideration to be Trumps top trade negotiator, is a former chief executive of steel giant Nucor Corp. who has long fought for protections against unfairly traded imports. In a YouTube video message published on Monday, Trump vowed to quit the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a proposed 12-country Pacific-rim trade bloc. Although the TPP terms were settled more than a year ago, the pact was never taken up by U.S. Republican leaders in Congress due in part to anti-free-trade rhetoric in the presidential campaign.   Calling it a a potential disaster for our country, Trump said his administration would instead negotiate fair, bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto American shores.  His comments would appear to snuff out any hopes among other TPP countries that the pact championed by President Barack Obama could be revived under the new administration. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said at a Pacific Rim summit on Saturday that he would be willing to discuss NAFTA with Trump to modernize the treaty  but not renegotiate existing provisions. He said that modernization could include adding environmental, labor and other provisions that werent contemplated when NAFTA was being negotiated in the early 1990s. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who met with Pena Nieto on the APEC sidelines, said he was keeping our options open on trade discussions with the U.S. president-elect.    But if NAFTA is reopened, Canada will insist that any renegotiation bring an end to a decades-old dispute over Canadian exports of softwood lumber, said David MacNaughton, Canadas ambassador to the United States. U.S. producers claim the Canadian wood is unfairly subsidized because it comes from federal lands and have threatened to seek billions of dollars in tariffs, which Canadian officials say would make a mockery of free trade. For Mexicos part, any concessions that would favor U.S. industrial goods could be met with demands to increase U.S. import quotas for Mexican sugar and protections for Mexicos potato crop. And both Mexico and Canada would likely demand greater access to compete for U.S. public sector procurements, now largely protected by Buy America laws. A major Trump administration infrastructure spending program would make this a more enticing target, Cutler said. Since NAFTA was enacted, total U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico has quadrupled to $1.3 trillion a year, but the U.S. combined goods trade deficit with Canada and Mexico has grown from $9.1 billion in 1993 to $76.2 billion in 2015. (Graphic showing trend in U.S. trade deficit, imports: tmsnrt.rs/2gajLSa) NAFTAs effect on U.S. jobs is disputed. Critics such as the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute charge that it has led to the loss of some 850,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs, while proponents such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce claim the trade growth has added a net 5 million jobs in the United States.   The non-partisan Congressional Research Service concluded that NAFTA has had only a small positive effect on U.S. growth, but has helped U.S. manufacturers become more competitive due to more efficient supply chains.      A renegotiated NAFTA could, ironically, end up borrowing key elements from the TPP to stiffen provisions on environment, labor and digital economy standards, trade experts said. Mexico and Canada have already agreed in the TPP to fully enforceable labor and environmental improvements, meaning that punitive duties could be imposed on countries that dont comply  a major step-up from NAFTA. TPP also included provisions governing e-commerce and cross-border data flows  sectors that barely existed as NAFTA was negotiated in the early 1990s  to better protect intellectual property and ensure a free and open internet. Officials in all three countries say NAFTA needs modernization in this area. Trump economic advisers Peter Navarro and Wilbur Ross have suggested, however, that the TPP environmental, health and safety standards arent strong enough.  In an economic white paper and various opinion pieces, Navarro, a University of California-Irvine business professor and Ross, a billionaire private equity investor who is being considered by Trump to lead the Commerce Department, said they want future U.S. trade deals to include prompt triggers and automatic renegotiation if trade gains are not distributed fairly. They also want ironclad sanctions against currency manipulation, and zero tolerance for intellectual property theft. In any negotiation or renegotiation, our guiding principle should be this: Enter into a free trade agreement only if it both increases total trade and reduces our trade deficit, they wrote.

"Trump foreign policies could hurt, help his business empire","LONDON (Reuters) - Any moves by Donald Trump to ban Muslims from entering the United States or bring back waterboarding to interrogate suspects could have repercussions for some of his sprawling foreign business interests  from his golf course in Scotland to luxury resorts in Indonesia. A review of press releases published on the Trump Organization website shows that 15 of 25 new acquisitions or joint ventures announced over the past five years were overseas. These include the purchase of golf courses in Ireland and Scotland and deals to license his name to developers and manufacturers in Dubai, Indonesia, India, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Mexico and Panama. The deals underscore the potential conflicts of interest Trump will face after he is sworn in as president on Jan. 20 and his vulnerability to criticism that he is open to foreign influence. Foreign governments could potentially seek to exploit Trumps business interests to affect his decision making, or to punish him through his pocket book for decisions they object to. Trumps transition team declined to comment for this story. In the 16 months to May, Trump earned up to $23 million from licensing his name to developers in emerging markets, according to a filing with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. The licensing deals are the best of all because theres no risk, Trump told Reuters in an interview in June. I have 121 deals right now, going forward, right now, 121, all over the world, in China, in Indonesia, he added. (Trump's foreign business interests: tmsnrt.rs/2gakiTQ) Trump has said he will hand control of his company to his children.  However, when he met with his Indian business partners last week it prompted a chorus of criticism that the wall between Trump and his company was still too porous. The Trump Organization has said a business structure will be set up that complies with all applicable rules and regulations. Trump has yet to commit to setting up a blind trust that would formally sever his ties with his business.  Im very confident hes not breaking any laws, Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Trump, told reporters at Trump Tower in New York on Monday. Trump could face a backlash against his business interests in Middle Eastern and Asian markets if he follows through with his campaign promise to ban Muslims from entering the United States, and continues to be open to restoring waterboarding - a form of interrogation widely viewed as torture - or creating a national registry for Muslims, analysts said. If the Muslim registry is introduced, he will have serious issues finding Muslim local partners, said Professor Koen Pauwels, a marketing specialist at Ozyegin University, Istanbul. There would be a backlash if Trump substantially tightens visa restrictions on Muslim visitors, Pauwels added. In December 2015, Trumps anti-Muslim comments cost him business in the Middle East when a major chain of department stores halted sales of his glitzy Trump Home line of lamps, mirrors and jewelry boxes in the region. Trump has long identified the Middle East as a major growth market, and his company is working with Dubai-based real estate giant DAMAC Properties to build two golf clubs - including one with a course designed by Tiger Woods - and a gated island community outside the city.  His daughter Ivanka said last year the organization was in talks on deals in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Trump has a licensing deal with a developer for a Trump-branded retail complex in Istanbul. He also has signed deals in Indonesia, the worlds most populous Muslim country, to put his name on a redeveloped luxury golf resort in Java and a luxury cliff-top hotel and residential development in Bali. And it is not just in the Middle East that Trump could face repercussions for any foreign policy decisions. Trumps $1.5 billion billion-pound golf and residential project north of Aberdeen in Scotland could also be affected, warned councilor Isobel Davidson, who sits on the panel responsible for approving planning applications for the project. If Trump proceeds with any anti-Muslim proposal, it could make it harder for him to advance his development, she said. Councilors are not supposed to take the character of the applicant into consideration when we are making a planning decision but sometimes its quite hard not to, she said. Analysts said they saw more potential upside for Trumps business from his election than downside. Very simply, people would want to be associated with the personal brand of the U.S. president. It will have a boost because he has become more famous that he was before, said Professor Chiranjib Sen, Azim Premji University in Indias Bangalore. One test case could be China, which the Trump Organization has identified as a top priority among high-potential emerging markets, according to a 2013 press release. On the campaign trail, Trump threatened to label China a currency manipulator and impose import tariffs on Chinese imports.  Suisheng Zhao, a China expert at the University of Denver, said if Trump did impose tariffs and more robustly challenged Chinas interests in the South China Sea, Beijing could tell Chinese businesses to abandon any talks or deals with the Trump Organization. Trump-branded property could also present a target for bombings or other kinds of attacks, said Professor Peter Neumann, of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence at Kings College London. From a terrorists perspective, its a very attractive target, he said. What Trump does not do could also affect his foreign business interests.  Mehmet Ugur, Professor of Economics and Institutions, at the University of Greenwich Business School, said that Trumps businesses could benefit if he takes a softer line on countries accused of human rights violations.  Countries such as Turkey, China and Indonesia would be more than happy to welcome Trump Organization, he said. ",politicsNews,"November 22, 2016 ",1
"Trump outlines plans for first day in office, meets with Cabinet hopefuls","NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump outlined plans on Monday for his first day in office, including withdrawing from a major trade accord and investigating abuses of work visa programs, and met with Cabinet hopefuls at his Manhattan office tower. Trump met with Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin, Democratic U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard and former Texas Governor Rick Perry. But he announced no further appointments, keeping candidates and the public guessing about the shape of the administration that will take office on Jan. 20. Fallin, Gabbard and Perry were the latest of dozens of officials who have made their way across the opulent lobby of Trump Tower for talks with the Republican president-elect in a relatively open - and unconventional - transition process since his election victory on Nov. 8. Trump, who has not held a news conference since his election, issued a video on Monday evening outlining some of his plans for his first day in office, including formally declaring his intent to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, trade deal, which he called a potential disaster for our country. The 12-nation TPP is Democratic President Barack Obamas signature trade initiative and was signed by the United States earlier this year but has not been ratified by the U.S. Senate. The president-elect said he would replace the accord with bilaterally negotiated trade deals that would bring jobs and industry back onto American shores. My agenda will be based on a simple core principle:  putting America first. Whether its producing steel, building cars or curing disease, I want the next generation of production and innovation to happen right here on our great homeland, America, creating wealth and jobs for American workers, he said. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday the TPP would be meaningless without the United States. Trump said he would cancel some restrictions on producing energy in the United States on his first day in office, particularly shale oil and clean coal, which he said would create many millions of high-paying jobs. He promised to direct the Labor Department to investigate abuses of visa programs for immigrant workers. The main U.S. visa program for technology workers could face tough scrutiny under Trump and his proposed attorney general, U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions, a longtime critic of the program. Trump had made eliminating regulations and withdrawing from the TPP central to his campaign, but he sent mixed signals during the campaign about his views on visa programs including the main H-1B visa for high-tech industry workers. Trump has so far picked two Cabinet members and three top White House advisers, but aides said he was not expected to make further announcements on Monday. They could come this week, they could come today, but were not in a rush to publish names, Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser, told reporters. Weve got to get it right. Trump spoke often with reporters camped out at his New Jersey golf course over the weekend, but has not held a traditional news conference to talk about his priorities. He held an off-the-record meeting with a group of television anchors and executives on Monday afternoon and was scheduled to meet with print media representatives on Tuesday. The Washington Post reported that four participants at Mondays meeting described it as a contentious but generally respectful session. They told the Post that Trump singled out reporting of his campaign by CNN and NBC that he considered to be unfair.  Trump also returned to Twitter on Monday night, saying  many people would like to see Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage as British ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job! Farage, who helped lead the successful referendum fight for Britain to leave the European Union, spoke at a Trump rally during the U.S. campaign and visited the president-elect after his victory. Trumps first meeting on Monday was with Iraq war veteran  Gabbard, a representative from Hawaii who backed U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in his unsuccessful 2016 Democratic presidential nominating contest against Hillary Clinton. The frank and positive discussion focused on the war in Syria, counterterrorism and other foreign policy issues, Gabbard said in a statement. She did not say whether a Cabinet role was part of the discussion. Gabbard has veered from Democratic Party positions at times, backing policies cracking down on immigration to the United States by Muslims. Fallin told reporters she was not offered a position but discussed a wide range of topics with Trump. The Republican governors spokesman said that included a focus on the Interior Department, an agency whose responsibilities include oversight of oil and gas leases on public lands. Former Republican U.S Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts told reporters he had a great meeting about veterans issues with Trump. Trump also met with former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich and Elaine Chao, the U.S. labor secretary under former President George W. Bush, advisers said. Trumps transition team said Perry, the former Texas governor, was being considered for Cabinet posts including defense, energy and veterans affairs.  Trump, a New York businessman who has never previously held public office and who was the surprise winner over Clinton this month, has so far named senior leaders of his national security and law enforcement teams. In addition to Sessions, they are U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas as CIA director, and retired Army Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as White House national security adviser. For Thanksgiving, Trump planned to travel on Tuesday to Mar-a-Lago, a golf resort he owns in Florida, a spokesman said. ",politicsNews,"November 21, 2016 ",1
Trump says will quit Pacific trade deal on day one of presidency,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump released a video on Monday laying out actions he will take on his first day in office on Jan. 20, including withdrawing the United States from a Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.

Trump picks regulation opponents to lead FCC transition,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trumps choice of experts to focus on new policies at the Federal Communications Commission signals a regime that will have a lighter touch on regulation and be more likely to favor large mergers in telecoms industries, analysts said. Economist Jeff Eisenach and former Sprint Corp (S.N) lobbyist Mark Jamison were named by Trumps transition team to oversee hiring and policy for the FCC. They both oppose some recent telecom industry regulations resisted by telecom and cable heavyweights such as Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and AT&T Inc (T.N) and have voiced support for mega mergers in the past. The FCC is composed of five commissioners, including one designated as chairman, who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Only three commissioners can be from the same political party and Trumps pick for FCC chairman would tip the balance in favor of Republicans.The addition of Eisenach and Jamison to Trumps landing team on Monday come as the Republican president-elect puts together a team to staff various government departments and agencies after he succeeds Democratic President Barack Obama on Jan. 20. The two appointments are harbingers of a more typical Republican FCC that is lighter on regulation and more focused on competition, said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. The focus will be more on reducing regulation than creating new ones. That would be in stark contrast to the Obama administrations FCC that enacted or proposed a handful of new industry rules and disapproved some proposed combinations, including Comcasts bid for Time Warner Cable and AT&Ts attempt to buy T-Mobile (TMUS.O).The FCC under Chairman Tom Wheeler, a Democrat, has had a rocky relationship with large telecom companies, some of which strongly opposed the agencys 2015 net neutrality or open internet rules. The rules, which require internet service providers to treat all data equally and bar them from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content, were seen as a major victory for internet businesses like Alphabet Incs Google (GOOGL.O) that offer services but do not own internet networks. PRO-BUSINESS POLICY Eisenach has supported mergers such as AT&T and T-Mobile as well as Sprint and T-Mobile that were dismissed by regulators during Obamas administration, according to analysts. He is known in telecom circles for having a pro-business mindset, New Street Research analyst Spencer Kurn said.  Whoever gets picked (as FCC chairman) is likely going to implement a similar pro-business policy, Kurn said.  Eisenach, who was previously tapped by the Trump campaign as an adviser on technology and telecom policy, is currently a managing director at consulting firm NERA Economic Consultings communications, media and internet practice. He previously held advisory roles at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the White House Office of Management and Budget. In 2014, he testified in the U.S. Senate against net neutrality rules, arguing there was no need for new regulation as existing antitrust rules, while not perfect, offered safeguards against concerns about the business practices of internet service providers. Jamison is the director of the Public Utility Research Center at the University of Florida. Like Eisenach, he has strongly disagreed in his publications with Wheelers rules, including net neutrality and a proposal to open up the market for rented pay-TV set-top boxes. That measure was aimed at breaking the telecom and cable companies grip on the $20 billion market and bringing in players such as Google and Apple (AAPL.O) in an effort to lower prices for consumers. Some analysts said the appointments also raised questions over whether Trump would carry out his campaign pledge to kill AT&Ts $85.4 billion proposal to buy Time Warner (TWX.N). Matt Wood, policy director of the technology rights group Free Press, saidthat even as Trump opposes the deal, he picked the pro-business economist Eisenach, whowas unlikely to want to block such a merger.

"In weekend of deliberation, Mattis favored for Trump Pentagon chief","BEDMINSTER, N.J. (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday assessed several more contenders for top U.S. posts including Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani, as blunt-spoken retired Marine Corps General James Mattis emerged as a leading candidate for defense secretary. Trump held meetings at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, with candidates for senior administration jobs after he takes office on Jan. 20. On Saturday, he conferred with Mattis and Mitt Romney, formerly a fierce Trump critic now under consideration for secretary of state. Summing up two days of talks as he said goodbye to retired U.S. Marines Corps General John Kelly on Sunday evening, Trump said he had made decisions on a couple of appointments. We really had some great meetings, and youll be hearing about them soon. Trump transition spokesman Sean Spicer said no decisions would be announced on Sunday night. Trump discussed the treasury secretary job with Jon Gray, a board member of the Blackstone Group, two sources familiar with their meeting said. A Trump transition team statement said their discussion included the U.S. economy, global capital markets and the world financial situation, as well as tax reform and long-term debt. The last person Trump escorted out of the clubhouse was Giuliani, the former New York mayor. Trump said earlier that Giuliani was a candidate for secretary of state and other things. The Trump team statement said Trump and Giuliani discussed administration priorities as well as restoring Americas prominence in the world, ongoing national security issues and threats at various hotspots on a global basis. Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, advised Trump during the presidential campaign but was dismissed as the head of his transition team. Asked by reporters before the meeting whether there was a place for Christie in his administration, Trump sidestepped the question but called him a very talented man, great guy. Trump met with billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, who he said was under consideration for commerce secretary. Asked whether he wanted the job, Ross told reporters: Well, time will tell.  Trump also received Jonathan Gray, the global head of real estate at the Blackstone Group, who is being considered for Treasury secretary, according to a person briefed on the matter. The president-elect has already tapped three senior leaders of his national security and law enforcement teams, choosing U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general, U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo as CIA director, and retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as national security adviser. The selections so far suggest that Trump, true to his campaign promises, intends to steer national security and foreign policy in a sharply different direction from that of Democratic President Barack Obama, whose record Trump harshly criticized during his campaign. Obama campaigned extensively for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton before the Nov. 8 election and warned during the campaign that Trump lacked the temperament and qualifications to be president. In Peru, as he wrapped up his last foreign trip, one that was overshadowed by Trumps surprise election, Obama encouraged Democrats on Sunday to work with the new administration but said he would weigh in as a citizen if the Trump administration challenged values he holds dear.  In another sign of Trumps novel approach to politics, the New York businessman who has never held public office said he planned to live in the White House but that his wife, Melania, and their 10-year-old son, Barron, would not move in immediately. He said they would move from New York to the White House very soon, right after he finishes school. While Trump received lawmakers, politicians and business leaders behind closed doors over the weekend, he gave some hints about his thinking and possible Cabinet choices on Twitter.  On Sunday, he tweeted that General James Mad Dog Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true Generals General! From 2010 to 2013, Mattis headed the U.S. militarys Central Command, which oversees operations stretching from the Horn of Africa through the Middle East and into Central Asia including Afghanistan and Pakistan. During that time, he was at odds with the Obama administration on the need to prepare for potential threats from Iran and about resources for Afghanistan. Mattis, 66, served as an American commander in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and was known to be popular among the troops. Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who now heads Trumps transition team, said Mattis had a legendary military career. Incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said it was a very real possibility Mattis would get the job, telling the ABC program This Week: I know that President-elect Trump loves leaders like General Mattis. Pence said that Trump and Romney had a good meeting and a warm and a substantive exchange. I can say that Governor Romney is under active and serious consideration to serve as secretary of state of the United States, Pence said on the CBS program Face the Nation.    Romney, the unsuccessful 2012 Republican presidential nominee, was a leader of the Republican establishment movement that tried to block Trump from becoming the nominee this year. In March, Romney called Trump a phony, a fraud and a con man. A source close to Romney from his time as Massachusetts governor expressed concern he might be frozen out by officials whose thinking appears to be closer to Trumps, such as Flynn, Mattis, White House counselor Steve Bannon, and members of Trumps family. How much influence and latitude he will have will be up to Trump, and they dont appear to be on the same page about much, the source said. Former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who made unsuccessful bids for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 and 2016, will meet with Trump on Monday and is being considered for Cabinet posts including defense, energy and veterans affairs, Trumps transition team said.

"Trump's Interior Department shortlist vexes employees, green groups","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trumps shortlist of candidates to lead the U.S. Department of Interior has employees and environmental advocates fearful of a shift in the agencys direction, from one focused on preserving public lands to one that would open them up to more drilling and mining. The outcome will have implications for industry access to millions of acres of national parks, reserves and tribal territories stretching from the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico and the viability of President Barack Obamas efforts to keep the United States in line with international agreements to reduce the impacts of climate change. Republican Trump, a New York real estate businessman who has never previously held public office, has leaned toward right-wing loyalists for the Cabinet since winning the Nov. 8 election. He is considering oil drilling advocates like Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin, Alaskas former governor Sarah Palin and Lucas Oil co-founder Forrest Lucas to run the Interior Department, media reports and Reuters sources said. Other contenders are several politicians from Western states who favor easier development of public lands. Any of those picks could trigger battles with environmental groups and cause internal strife at an agency where many workers see themselves as land stewards after nearly eight years of conservation-minded policies under Democrat Obama. Public lands have been set aside to preserve and protect cultural and scientific resources for future generations, said Geoff Goins, a National Park Service ranger at the Bandelier National Monument in New Mexico, adding that with Trump coming in, people are concerned about their jobs.   Other Interior Department employees interviewed by Reuters said they were worried the agencys environmental mandate would be weakened under Trump, and green advocates said they were bracing to resist those changes. Climate change is a major focus of conservation concern for national parks, said one National Park Service employee in the Northwest who asked not to be identified. If (Trumps administration) gets in the way of scientists...we are all in deep trouble. During the election campaign, Trump tweeted that the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive - a view that is at odds with most but a few scientists who study the impacts of rising global temperatures and extreme weather.        Maureen Finnerty, chair of the Coalition to Protect Americas National Parks, an organization of more than 1,200 current and former National Parks employees, said it was ready to launch a public relations campaign against Trump if he pursues an anti-environmental agenda. We will be vigilant and hope for the best, she said. The Interior Department employs more than 70,000 people across the United States and oversees over 20 percent of federal land. Under Obama, the Interior Department played a big role in efforts to curb the effects of climate change by limiting fossil fuel development in some areas. Outgoing Interior Secretary Sally Jewell banned coal mining on public lands, canceled leases for drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic coasts, expanded wildlife protection and cracked down on industry methane emissions. The Obama administration planned on using forest restoration on federal lands as a way to help the United States meet its long-term goals under the 2015 Paris agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The agreement outlines how countries will deal with lowering greenhouse gas emissions starting in 2020.  Trump has given mixed messages on his plans for Interior. In an interview with Field and Stream magazine in January, Trump said: I want to keep the lands great... We have to be great stewards of this land. But he has advocated strongly for boosting energy development on federal lands and has criticized Obamas use of environmental regulation to check oil and gas development. He picked renowned climate change skeptic Myron Ebell to run his transition at the Environmental Protection Agency. U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said Trump could consider hiring as his energy secretary Harold Hamm, an oil and gas driller and a pioneer of developing shale oil resources. One potential Interior Department head is Oklahoma Governor Fallin, who met with Trump on Monday. She has been an ardent supporter of Oklahomas drilling industry and has blocked attempts to ban hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a controversial drilling technology. Fallins spokesman confirmed she is being considered for the post, but said there has been no offer given. Also on the shortlist is Palin, who made famous the motto Drill, Baby, Drill when she was the vice presidential running-mate to Republican John McCain in 2008, and former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, a Trump supporter without experience in public lands policy. Governor Butch Otter of Idaho, venture capitalist Robert Grady and U.S. Representatives Cynthia Lummis and Rob Bishop of Wyoming and Utah are also potential candidates for the job. All declined comment. (Refiles to correct typographical error National Park Service instead of National Parks Service.) ",politicsNews,"November 21, 2016 ",1

"Tech worker visas face uncertain future under Trump, Sessions","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The main U.S. visa program for technology workers could face renewed scrutiny under President-elect Donald Trump and his proposed Attorney General, Senator Jeff Sessions, a long-time critic of the skilled-worker program. H-1B visas admit 65,000 workers and another 20,000 graduate student workers each year. The tech industry, which has lobbied to expand the program, may now have to fight a rear-guard action to protect it, immigration attorneys and lobbyists said. Trump sent mixed signals on the campaign trail, sometimes criticizing the visas but other times calling them an important way to retain foreign talent. Sessions, however, has long sought to curtail the program and introduced legislation last year aiming to make the visas less available to large outsourcing companies such as Infosys. Such firms, by far the largest users of H-1B visas, provide foreign contractors to U.S. companies looking to slash information technology costs. Thousands of U.S. workers are being replaced by foreign labor, Sessions said at a February hearing. A spokesperson for Sessions did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Trump transition team spokesperson declined to comment. The H-1B visa is intended for specialty occupations that typically require a college education. Companies use them in two main ways to hire technology workers. Tech firms such as Microsoft and Google typically hire highly skilled, well-paid foreign workers that are in short supply. They help many of them secure so-called green cards that allow them to work in the U.S. permanently. By contrast, firms such as Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services, both based in India, use the visas to deploy lower-paid contractors that critics say rarely end up with green cards. Infosys did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Tata spokesman declined to comment. H-1B visas are assigned through a lottery once a year by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. This year, companies filed 236,000 petitions for the 85,000 available visas, a cap set in U.S. law. They are awarded to employers - not employees - and tied to specific positions. Both Democratic and Republican critics have argued that companies such as Walt Disney Co and Southern California Edison Co (SCE_pe.A), a utility, have used the program to terminate in-house IT employees and replace them with cheaper contractors. Sessions last year urged then-Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate Southern California Edisons use of H-1B visas in a letter than was also signed by Democratic Sens. Bernie Sanders, Richard Durbin and Sherrod Brown. Disney and Edison did not immediately respond to requests for comment but have said previously that they paid foreign contractors comparably with local staffers. The Justice Department in 2013 settled a visa fraud case with Infosys for $34 million. Federal investigators accused Infosys of using easier-to-obtain business travel visas to import foreign workers who were required to have H-1B visas. Investigators also alleged that Infosys told foreign workers to lie to U.S. officials about the cities where they would work. In the settlement, Infosys denied the allegations but agreed to retain a third-party auditor for two years and to provide the government with detailed descriptions of what its visa holders were supposed to be doing in the U.S. Several constituencies have called for program reforms, including the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, that industrys largest professional association. It wants the lottery ditched in favor of a system that would award visas to companies offering the highest-paying jobs, said Russ Harrison, director of government relations.  That could potentially shut out employers looking to mine the program for cheap foreign labor. Sessions included a similar measure in his 2015 bill. Tech industry groups also want changes. FWD.us - the immigration lobbying group backed by Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg - supports setting higher minimum wages and giving priority to companies that sponsor H-1B workers for green cards. Were going to advocate for expanding the program, but were also going to advocate for reforming the program, FWD.us President Todd Shulte said in an interview. The current program mainly benefits big companies at the expense of both U.S. and immigrant workers, said Gaurav Mehta, a 32-year-old H-1B holder from New Delhi who works for a cyber security firm in San Francisco. H-1B workers struggle to switch jobs without risking deportation, he said, which allows employers to pay them less. The current system is not working for Americans, and its not working for immigrants, he said. Some Trump allies expect him to keep the program mostly intact, including Shalabh Shalli Kumar - an Indian-born Chicago businessman who donated $900,000 to his campaign.  He has said to us that these are amazing people and it would be crazy to let them go, Kumar said in an interview. But Kumar has urged Trump to eliminate country-by-country quotas that create long waits for Indian and Chinese nationals to get green cards. John Miano, an attorney with the Immigration Reform Law Institute - a conservative group that has been aligned with Trump - also supports prioritizing H-1B applications from companies offering higher pay. Such a change would hit the outsourcing firms hard. The top 10 recipients of H-1B visas in 2015 were all outsourcing firms, according to government data compiled by the IEEE. Tata Consultancy Services topped the list by securing 8,333 H-1B visas. Amazon, by contrast, ranked number 12 and was awarded just 826 H-1B visas. Google and Microsoft ranked No. 14 and 15, with Facebook at No. 24 and Apple at No. 34. Some H-1B visa holders arent waiting. Sofie Graham - a marketer at the San Francisco startup BuildZoom.com and a dual Irish and British citizen - secured her H-1B visa last year. Although she could have worked for six years on the visa, she and the company decided to apply for a green card. Everywhere I looked, people were saying we should have fewer H-1Bs, she said. I just wanted to get a green card as soon as possible.

Obama administration bars new oil exploration in Arctic waters,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Friday blocked new exploration for oil and gas in Arctic waters, in a win for environmental groups that had fought development of the ecologically fragile region. The Department of the Interior released a 2017 to 2022 leasing plan that blocked drilling in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas off northern Alaska. It also limited petroleum development in the Cook Inlet off south-central Alaska.  Environmental activists have battled drilling in Alaska to protect whales, walruses and seals, and as part of a broader movement to keep remaining fossil fuels in the ground. The Interior Department said the plan was balanced, and left 70 percent of economically recoverable oil and gas resources open to drilling, mostly in the Gulf of Mexico. The plan focuses on the best areas with the highest resource potential, lowest conflict and established infrastructure - and removes regions that are simply not right to lease, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said.  President Barack Obama, who last year became the first sitting president to cross the Arctic Circle, has made fighting climate change and protecting the Arctic priorities in his administration. But President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican who takes office on Jan. 20, 2017, has vowed to open resources to petroleum development and could take steps to reverse the decision. Oil interests have pressured the administration to explore for energy in the Arctic. Jack Girard, the head of the American Petroleum Institute industry group, said the decision puts the U.S. at a serious competitive disadvantage. Russia and Norway have also explored the Arctic, though Exxon Mobil wound down drilling in the Russian north in 2014 due to U.S. sanctions over Moscows aggression in eastern Ukraine. Fierce winds and frigid waters make the Arctic treacherous for drilling equipment. After spending billions of dollars to explore the Alaskan Arctic, Royal Dutch Shell retreated in 2015 after suffering a gash in one of its ships and environmentalists had uncovered details of an old law that forced the company to cut exploration there by half.  The U.S. Coast Guard complained when Shell was drilling off Alaska that it had been forced to divert resources, including a vessel that fought cocaine trafficking, to keep operations in the region safe. (reut.rs/2g4yHSW) Environmentalists applauded the new lease plan, which built on a similar decision in March when the government removed much of the Atlantic ocean from oil and gas leasing for five years. This is excellent news for our oceans, from the Arctic to the Atlantic, said Jacqueline Savitz, deputy vice president for U.S. campaigns of Oceana, an international advocacy group.

Gun shops eye busy Black Friday despite Hillary Clinton loss,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Christmas came early for U.S. gun shop owners - who saw a rush of firearms purchases ahead of the presidential election - but they may now be hard-pressed to match last years record holiday sales. Gun merchants had a record October, federal background check data shows, as gun enthusiasts snapped up pistols and rifles on fears that Democrat Hillary Clinton would win the White House and seek to restrict ownership.  Traffic has fallen off substantially since Republican Donald Trump, a gun rights supporter, won the presidency on Nov. 8. Shares of Smith & Wesson Holding Corp SWHC.O are down 15 percent since then, despite a rebound this week, while Sturm Ruger & Companys (RGR.N) stock is 17 percent lower. Like most other retailers, gun sellers thrive during the holidays. Last years Black Friday featured record activity for a single day, according background check data.  December 2015 was the second busiest month ever, topped only by December 2012, when President Barack Obama threatened to rein in gun rights after a deranged man killed 26 people, including 20 children, in a shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Obama, a Democrat, never enacted any sweeping new gun restrictions because he faced opposition in a Republican-controlled Congress. Now, with this years Black Friday just days away, gun dealers say traffic is regaining momentum after the post-election drop. Im not expecting it to be any slower than our normal Black Friday, said Kellie Weeks, owner of Georgia Gun Store in Gainesville, Georgia. But if Hillary had won, we would have sold out already.  After Obama was elected in 2008, November background checks jumped 48 percent compared to the prior November, according to background check data from the National Shooting Sports Foundation. By comparison, checks rose a more modest 5 percent in November 2004 after Republican George W. Bush was re-elected. Such checks are the best proxy for data on gun sales, which gun manufacturers do not publicly release. The foundation strips the data of applications for conceal-carry permits - typically made by people who already own guns - to give a better reflection of actual purchases.  Through October 2016, background checks are up 15 percent compared to the same amount of time last year, suggesting another a strong year of overall sales. Wall Street expects Smith & Wessons revenue to increase 28 percent in 2016 and 11 percent next year, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Springfield, Massachusetts, company reports its October-quarter results on December 1. Even after the recent selloff, Smith & Wessons stock is up 10 percent in 2016, better than the S&P 500s 7-percent rise. Gilberts Gun Shop in Frankfort, Kentucky, expects to sell fewer high-capacity magazines over the holidays because customers no longer fear they will be banned. But the shop and other gun stores consulted by Reuters remain hopeful that demand for newly launched compact and target pistols will help spur a busy holiday season. Some categories might be light, he said. But in general, sales through Black Friday and Christmas, I still think will be very strong. ",politicsNews,"November 21, 2016 ",1

"Obama, Putin talk about Syria and Ukraine in quick summit meet","LIMA (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin spoke for around four minutes on Sunday at the APEC summit about Syria and Ukraine, in what is likely to be their last in-person meeting before Obama leaves office. The two men met at the start of the summit meeting in Lima, Perus capital. They exchanged pleasantries and remained standing as they spoke. Obama later said at a news conference he told Putin the U.S. is deeply concerned about bloodshed and chaos in Syria sown by constant bombing attacks by the Syrian and Russian militaries, and that a ceasefire and political transition were needed. As usual I was candid and courteous but very clear about the strong differences we have on policy, Obama said. Putin said at a separate news conference he thanked Obama during Sundays meeting in Lima for the years of joint work. I told him that we would be happy to see him (Obama) in Russia anytime if he wants, can and has desire, Putin said. Obama and Putin have had a challenging relationship. The U.S. president said last week he had warned Putin about consequences for cyber attacks attributed to Moscow that were seen as trying to influence the U.S. election.     Obama said he also urged President Putin to help implement the Minsk peace agreement by working with France, Germany, Ukraine and the United States to halt the conflict in Donbass region of Ukraine.  During his race for the White House, Republican President-elect Donald Trump praised Putin. Putin said on Sunday that Trump had confirmed to him that he was willing to mend ties.

"New York's Cuomo unveils rights initiative, says election spawned 'social crisis'","NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Sunday launched an initiative to combat hate crimes and protect civil rights, saying the divisive U.S. presidential campaign had prompted a wave of disturbing incidents across the state and the country. In a speech at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York City, Cuomo said he would form a hate crimes unit of the state police, propose legislation increasing protections against discrimination for public school students and establish a private-public legal defense fund for impoverished immigrants. The ugly political discourse of the election did not end on Election Day, Cuomo, a Democrat, told the well-known African-American congregation. In many ways it has gotten worse, (growing) into a social crisis that now challenges our identity as a state and as a nation and our people. Civil rights groups including the ACLU have expressed concern over reports of a spate of incidents that appear motivated by racism, bigotry and sexism since Republican Donald Trump won the presidential election on Nov. 8.  Those reports include a swastika painted on a baseball dugout in the western New York village of Wellsville with the words Make America White Again, a racist version of Trumps slogan, Make America Great Again. Several New York officials were scheduled to appear on Sunday at a rally organized by The Beastie Boys at Brooklyns Adam Yauch Park, which was named for the late member of the hip-hop group. The musicians called for the event after swastikas were found drawn at the park. On Friday, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the Justice Department is investigating whether any of the incidents constituted hate crimes, which would trigger harsher penalties for the perpetrators. Cuomo, whose name has been floated as a possible Democratic presidential candidate in 2020, joined other officials in his party who have denounced the attacks since Election Day. Mayors in a number of large cities, including New York, Chicago and San Francisco, have insisted in recent weeks that their communities would remain so-called sanctuary cities, despite Trumps campaign pledge to cut off federal funding for such municipalities. In sanctuary cities, local law enforcement generally do not help federal authorities search for undocumented immigrants. ",politicsNews,"November 20, 2016 ",1
Trump team promises to address ethics concerns on businesses,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump will work to ensure there is proper separation between his business empire and his job as president of the United States, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said on Sunday, amid fresh concerns about conflict of interest following a meeting with Indian real estate executives. Trump, who has said he planned to turn over handling of the Trump Organization to his adult children, has come under criticism for meeting on Tuesday with three Indian businessmen who are partners in a project to build a Trump-branded luxury apartment complex in Mumbai. Pence said on the CBS program Face the Nation that Trump and his family would work with the best legal minds in this country and create the proper separation from their business enterprise during his duties as president of the United States. A photo of the three executives meeting with Trump was posted on Twitter. Indian newspapers reported last week that the business leaders talked with the Trump Organization about expanding the Trump branded projects in India. Incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, speaking on CNNs State of the Union program, said Trump would comply with all laws and have the White House counsels office review all of these things. And we will have every I dotted and every T crossed, and I can assure the American people that there wouldnt be any wrongdoing, or any sort of undue influence over any decision-making, Priebus said. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has said his businesses will be overseen by his three grown children, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump. Priebus was asked if it was appropriate for family members to sit in on official meetings after Ivanka Trump attended her fathers meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday. Donald Trump has been very clear from the very beginning that his family is very important to him, Priebus said on CNN. ",politicsNews,"November 20, 2016 ",1
Pence not offended by comments to him at 'Hamilton' show,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President-elect Mike Pence said on Sunday he was not offended by rare and pointed comments made to him by a cast member of Hamilton after he attended the hit Broadway show. I wasnt offended, Pence said on Fox News Sunday, declining to ask for an apology as President-elect Donald Trump had demanded.  Pence acknowledged that many Americans were disappointed and anxious after Trumps surprise Nov. 8 election victory following a raucous campaign, but he sought to reassure Americans that Trump would be a president for all Americans. After the show on Friday evening, Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Americas third vice president, Aaron Burr, read a statement directed at Pence, who was in the audience, while standing in front of the cast in full costume. We, sir - we - are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, Dixon said. Pence sought to address Dixons concerns, telling CBS in a separate interview that Trump has a great heart. Hes got heart for the American people and wanted to reassure anyone, including the actor who spoke that night, that President-elect Donald Trump is going to be president of all the people. Trump criticized the cast in a series of tweets on Saturday and again on Sunday.  The Theater must always be a safe and special place. The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize! Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday, taking time out from his search for appointees to his incoming administration.  Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing. This should not happen! Pence praised the hit show and urged people to see it. Trump called the sold-out show highly overrated Sunday. Pence noted that there were some boos and cheers when he arrived at the theater. He recalled telling his family of the response: Thats what freedom sounds like. Hamilton is a hip-hop-infused musical that tells the story of Alexander Hamilton, a penniless immigrant who rose to become the right-hand man of General George Washington, as well as a key figure in the creation of the U.S. financial system and the creator of the U.S. Coast Guard.

Romney under 'active consideration' for Secretary of State: Pence,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney is under active consideration to serve as U.S. Secretary of State along with other candidates, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said on Fox News Sunday.  Romney, who met President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday, was a critic of Trump during the campaign. Pence said that Romney was willing to be considered for the position. Trump was very grateful that Governor Mitt Romney came in. They had a good meeting. It was a warm and a substantive exchange and I know he is under active consideration to be Secretary of State... along with some other distinguished Americans.  But Democrats were skeptical that Romney is an actual contender. Representative Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said on CNN Sunday that he would love Romney to get the position and he would be a consummate diplomat. But I think its a total head fake. I think this is Donald Trump still being the entertainer, still running a show where he wants to build suspense and he alone knows who the contestant will be the winner. Its more of a nod to the appearance of bringing people together.   ",politicsNews,"November 20, 2016 ",1

Queen to invite Trump to Britain for state visit: Sunday Times,"LONDON (Reuters) - Queen Elizabeth will invite U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for a state visit to Britain next year to try to cement close ties between the two countries, The Sunday Times newspaper said. Citing two ministers and a senior official close to Downing Street, the Sunday Times reported that discussions between British officials and Trumps team would start soon to ensure that a date could be agreed for June or July next year. Britain is keen to reinforce its special relationship with the United States as the government of Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to leave the European Union, a divorce that will shape the countrys standing in the world. Trump invited May to visit him as soon as possible during their first telephone call since his election victory, the British prime ministers office has said. Aides for May have said as yet there is no date for the trip. The Sunday Times said the British government hopes that an official state visit will be its secret weapon for cementing ties after Trump met leading Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage earlier this month - the first British politician to do so. The newspaper also said the president-elect told May during their phone call last week that his late Scottish mother was a big fan of the Queen and asked the prime minister to pass on his best wishes to her.

"Obama tells Latin America and world: give Trump time, don't assume worst","LIMA (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama did in Latin America what he tried to do in Europe: tell worried citizens not to draw negative conclusions about the man he once called unfit to serve in the White House, President-elect Donald Trump. In the last stop of an international farewell tour that included visits to Greece and Germany, Obama continued his efforts to calm anxieties since Republican businessman Trump beat Democratic rival and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential race. My main message to you ... and the message I delivered in Europe is dont just assume the worst, Obama told a group of young people during a question-and-answer session in Peru on Saturday. Wait until the administration is in place, its actually putting its policies together, and then you can make your judgments as to whether or not its consistent with the international communitys interest in living in peace and prosperity together. Trump won the election after promising to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, rip up trade deals and ban Muslims temporarily from entering the United States. Obama has sought to soothe fears by pledging to ensure a smooth transition of power and expressing optimism that the president-elect would shift away from inflammatory campaign rhetoric once he faced the realities of the job. It will be important for everybody around the world to not make immediate judgments but give this new president-elect a chance to put their team together, to examine the issues, to determine what their policies will be, because as Ive always said, how you campaign isnt always the same as how you govern, Obama said. But Obama has couched his assurances largely in hopeful language that Trumps team would see the merits of policies that Democrats championed despite Trumps pledged to dismantle them, from the Iran nuclear deal to an international pact to fight climate change. And the president, who campaigned vigorously for Clinton and showed visible disdain for Trump before his victory, has offset his words of reassurance with subtle digs at his successor by emphasizing themes of democratic values in Europe and Peru that Trump has been criticized for ignoring.  Youre seeing some countries that are going backwards rather than forwards in terms of freedom of the press, in terms of freedom of the Internet, in terms of respecting political opposition and civil society, Obama said on Saturday. Trump barred some news organizations from covering events during his campaign and threatened during a televised debate to jail Clinton for her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Though Obama came on his trip able to assure European countries that Trump would respect U.S. commitments to NATO, his other assurances, including for Latin American policy, seemed based more on optimism than knowledge of Trumps plans. With respect to Latin America, I dont anticipate major changes in policy from the new administration, he said, citing trade as a key exception. Trump announced hawkish picks for attorney general, national security adviser, and CIA director on Friday that suggest he is setting up his administration to take a hard line confronting Islamist militancy and curbing illegal immigration.

"As he shapes Cabinet, Trump meets former rival Romney and retired Gen. Mattis","BEDMINSTER, N.J. (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney set aside a fierce rivalry on Saturday and held talks likely to feed speculation that Romney could be in line to be the next U.S. secretary of state. After a day of meetings, Trump emerged to tell reporters that his search process was going really efficiently and that he had spoken to really, really talented people who could form part of his Cabinet. Trump said he might have some announcements on Sunday. He spoke highly of retired Marine General James Mattis, who transition officials said was a strong contender for defense secretary. Earlier, Trump and Romney emerged from their meeting after an hour and 20 minutes, and Trump told reporters their talks went great. Romney said the pair had a far-reaching conversation with regards to the various theaters in the world. We discussed those areas, and exchanged our views on those topics  a very thorough and in-depth discussion in the time we had, Romney said. And I appreciate the chance to speak with the president-elect and I look forward to the coming administration and the things that its going to be doing. Trumps team said in a statement that Trump and Romney held a substantive and in-depth conversation about world affairs, national security and the future of America. It was an extremely positive and productive conversation, the statement said. Trump  met for an hour with Mattis. Asked if Mattis would be his defense secretary, Trump said, Hes a great guy. He is some great man.  The Trump team statement said Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were very impressed with Mattis. They had an incredibly in-depth conversation on plans for national security. The discussion included ISIS, the Middle East, North Korea, China, NATO and other hotspots around the world, the statement said. Romney, who was a leader of the establishment Republican never Trump movement that tried to block Trump from becoming the nominee, was first in a long list of people Trump was meeting with on Saturday and Sunday as he seeks to fill out his Cabinet and gather advice ahead of his Jan. 20 move to the White House. In March, Romney said Trump would be dangerous as president, with policies that could touch off a recession. Romney also said, Im afraid that when it comes to foreign policy he is very, very not smart.  Trump had denounced Romney as a choke artist for losing the 2012 election to President Barack Obama. But with the New York real estate developer now president-in-waiting, Romneys appearance at Trump National Bedminster on an unseasonably warm November day was symbolic of hard-won party unity.     Whether Romney will join the Trump administration is unclear. Romney, a more mainstream Republican, would serve alongside more hawkish Trump appointees named on Friday: Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama as attorney general, retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as national security adviser and Representative Mike Pompeo as CIA director. Those nominations suggest Trump is setting up his administration to take a hard line confronting Islamist militancy and curbing illegal immigration. Transition officials said Trumps meeting with Romney was supposed to be a general discussion about the incoming administration. A Romney confidant said of Romneys secretary of state prospects: Could it happen? I suppose. But its unlikely. Instead, the source said the meeting gives the good housekeeping seal of approval to Republicans who dont know if they should help Trump or not.     Trump has been considering former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a close adviser, for secretary of state, as well as former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee. Trump is to meet Giuliani on Sunday. Also on Saturday, Trump met with Andy Puzder, chief executive of CKE Restaurants, the fast-food giant that operates the Carls Jr. and Hardees chains. Afterwards, Trump said he was getting very close to making some Cabinet decisions. Puzder, a possible labor secretary, said he would be proud to serve in any position that this president asks me to serve in. In addition, he met with two candidates for education secretary: Michelle Rhee, the former Washington, D.C., public schools chancellor, and Betsy DeVos, a former head of the Michigan Republican Party. On Sunday, Trump is to sit down with Wilbur Ross, a potential commerce secretary who made billions by investing in bankrupt companies and distressed assets, and business executive David McCormick, head of investment firm Bridgewater Associates, as well as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who was recently demoted in his role on Trumps transition team.

Senior U.S. officials recommend removal of NSA director: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The heads of the Pentagon and the U.S. intelligence community have recommended to President Barack Obama that the director of the National Security Agency, Admiral Michael Rogers, be removed from his position, sources familiar with the matter said on Saturday.  The recommendation by Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, first reported by The Washington Post, was delivered to the White House last month.   Obama chose Rogers to take over at the NSA in 2014 and gave him the task of repairing the damage after the huge leaks about its electronic spying program by contractor Edward Snowden.  But there have been other security lapses, the sources said, including the one that led to the arrest of NSA contractor Harold Martin earlier this year.   Rogers is being considered as a potential new director of national intelligence by President-elect Donald Trump, a post that oversees all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies. The Washington Post reported that a decision by Rogers to travel to New York to meet with Trump on Thursday without notifying superiors caused consternation at senior levels of the administration, but the recommendation to remove him predated his visit. Rogers is head of both the National Security Agency and the U.S. militarys Cyber Command. Carter was also disappointed with the Cyber Commands performance in the war against Islamic State, another source said. The White House, Pentagon, NSA and office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. A Trump campaign spokesman had no immediate comment.  U.S. Representative Devin Nunes, chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee and a Republican, said later on Saturday he had written to Carter and Clapper asking them to testify to the committee about the matter. The Obama administration wants to split leadership at the National Security Agency and Cyber Command, arguing that the job of leading two agencies with differing missions is too much for one person.  But some members of Congress, led by Republican Senator John McCain, the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, oppose that plan, saying that Cyber Command needs access to the NSAs resources to do its job effectively.

Trump blasts 'Hamilton' cast as 'rude'; creator Miranda says he's 'proud',"NEW YORK (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday demanded an apology from the cast of Hamilton for appealing from the stage to Mike Pence to uphold our American values while the vice-president-elect was attending a performance of the Broadway hit. The Theater must always be a safe and special place. The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize! Trump wrote on Twitter, taking time out from his search for appointees to his incoming administration. Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing. This should not happen! Trump wrote. A mix of boos and cheers greeted Pence, a Republican, as he  entered the Richard Rodgers Theater in New York on Friday night to watch the highly acclaimed rap musical about the countrys founding fathers, whose color-blind cast features African-American and Latino actors portraying the countrys founding fathers, all of whom were white. After the show, Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Americas third vice president, Aaron Burr, read a statement directed at Pence while standing in front of the cast in full costume.     We, sir  we  are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, Dixon said.  Pence had already begun to leave his seat as Dixon began his remarks, videos posted on social media showed. We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us, Dixon said as audience members cheered and clapped. Trumps remarks triggered a barrage of posts on Twitter, most of which were critical of the president-elect. Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement that the Hamilton cast was exercising the right to free speech and that Trump was wrong to criticize them for doing so. The apology should instead come from President-elect Trump for calling into question the appropriateness of the Hamilton casts statements, Romero said.   A show spokesman said Pence stood in the hallway outside the entrance to the auditorium and heard the full remarks, the New York Times reported.   Hamilton is a hip-hop-infused musical that tells the story of Alexander Hamilton, a penniless immigrant who rose to become the right-hand man of General George Washington, as well as a key figure in the creation of the U.S. financial system and the creator of the U.S. Coast Guard. He was killed in an 1804 duel with Burr.             The actor Dixon fired back at Trumps allegations of harassment.  @realDonaldTrump conversation is not harassment sir. And I appreciate @mike_pence for stopping to listen, he tweeted in response to Trumps Tweet. The shows award-winning creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, posted his own response. Proud of @HamiltonMusical. Proud of @BrandonVDixon, for leading with love. And proud to remind you that ALL are welcome at the theater, Miranda wrote on Twitter. Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who supported Trump during the presidential campaign, slammed the casts actions in a message on Twitter.  The arrogance and hostility of the Hamilton cast to the Vice President elect ( a guest at the theater) is a reminder the left still fights, wrote Gingrich, who is viewed as a possible pick for Trumps cabinet.  Kellyanne Conway, Trumps campaign manager, wrote on Twitter that Pence had deserved respect and a peaceful night out with his nephew and daughter at the theater. ",politicsNews,"November 19, 2016 ",1

"Trump picks conservative loyalists for top security, law enforcement jobs","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump pickedthree conservative loyalists to lead his national security and law enforcement teams on Friday, underscoring his campaign promise to take a hard line confronting Islamist militancy and curbing illegal immigration. Trump picked U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general, rewarding a staunch supporter whose tough and sometimes inflammatory statements on immigration have reflected his own. The choice was applauded by the top Republican in the Senate but drew sharp criticism from civil rights activists. Retired Army Lieutenant General Mike Flynn, who has championed Trumps promises to take a more aggressive approach to terrorism, was chosen as his national security adviser.  Trump named Representative Mike Pompeo, a vocal critic of the Obama administrations security policy, as director of the Central Intelligence Agency. The three choices, announced by Trumps transition team, come as the Republican president-elect works to fill key positions in his administration, which will take over from Democratic President Barack Obama on Jan. 20. The picks could heighten concerns abroad that the Trump administration might carry out campaign promises of banning Muslims from entering the United States or imposing more severe restrictions on migrants from countries or regions with high levels of militant Islamist activity, such as Iraq and Syria.  Sessions and Pompeo seem likely to be confirmed by the Senate despite heavy resistance from Democrats. Republicans will control a majority, with at least 51 seats in the 100-seat chamber, when Congress reconvenes in January. Flynns post does not need Senate confirmation.   One of the earliest Republican lawmakers to support Trumps White House candidacy, Sessions opposes any path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and was an enthusiastic backer of Trumps campaign promise to build a wall on the border with Mexico. He has also argued for curbs on legal immigration on the grounds that it drives down wages for U.S. workers. A former Alabama attorney general and U.S. attorney, Sessions, 69, has been in the Senate for 19 years. Allegations that he made racist remarks led the Senate to deny his confirmation as a federal judge in 1986. The chambers top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, said he would want Sessions to answer  tough questions about his civil rights positions. The attorney general acts as the countrys chief law enforcement officer and head of the Justice Department. Civil rights groups slammed Sessions as a poor choice to head a department charged with protecting voting rights and running immigration courts. How can we trust someone in that role who has demonstrated he thinks all forms of immigration are bad for America? said Beth Werlin, head of the American Immigration Council.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he strongly supported Sessions for attorney general, calling him principled, forthright, and hardworking. Sessions has been one of Trumps most enthusiastic backers on Capitol Hill and the president-elect has hired several of Sessions staffers, including policy chief Stephen Miller and Rick Dearborn, who has a top job managing the transition. Also on Friday, the first set of transition landing teams were starting work at the departments of State, Justice, Defense and the National Security Council to begin hashing out the details of shifting to a new administration.  Flynn, one of Trumps closest advisers, was fired from the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, a move he has attributed to his outspoken views about fighting Islamist militancy. Other officials who worked with Flynn cited his lack of management skills and leadership style as reasons for his firing. An Army intelligence veteran of three decades, Flynn was assistant director of national intelligence under Obama. He views the 2003 invasion of Iraq as a strategic blunder and has refused to condemn Trumps support for the renewed use of waterboarding. This is an interrogation technique that simulates drowning, is widely considered torture and was banned by Obama. Pompeo, 52, a third-term Republican congressman and former U.S. Army officer who founded an aerospace company, was a surprise pick to lead the CIA. A member of the House Intelligence Committee, Pompeo has called for a revival and expansion of a now-defunct domestic spying program to include financial and lifestyle information as well as phone records. He has said that Edward Snowden, a former government contractor who uncovered the spying program and who now lives in Russia, should get the death penalty if he is ever tried and convicted. Pompeo has been one of the most aggressive critics of the Obama administrations handling of a 2012 attack on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.  Nevertheless, Democrats who have worked with him joined Republicans in describing Pompeo as knowledgeable and hard working. While we have had our share of strong differences - principally on the politicization of the tragedy in Benghazi - I know that he is someone who is willing to listen and engage,  Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said on Friday.  Trump met on Friday with former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, a possible pick to head the Department of Homeland Security, and U.S. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a possible candidate for defense secretary. Trump is considering retired General David Petraeus, who resigned as CIA chief in 2012 after an extra-marital affair, is being considered for the post of defense secretary, the Wall Street Journal said. Trump was expected to spend the weekend in Bedminster, New Jersey, the home of the Trump National Golf Club. On Saturday he was scheduled to meet with Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee. Romney was one of the fiercest Republican critics of Trump during his unorthodox election campaign but is now under possible consideration for secretary of state. Admiral Mike Rogers, director of the National Security Agency, is the leading candidate to serve as Trumps director of national intelligence, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Trump defends decision to settle Trump University lawsuits,"(Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday defended his decision to settle lawsuits over his Trump University real estate seminars for $25 million, saying he does not have time to fight the fraud cases in court now that he is headed to the White House. The lawsuits cast a shadow over the Republicans presidential campaign and led to one of the more controversial moments of his run for the White House when he claimed the judge overseeing two of the cases was biased because he was of Mexican ancestry.  While denying any wrongdoing, Trump agreed on Friday to pay $25 million to settle the lawsuits. I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country, Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday morning.   New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has said over 5,000 students across the country were defrauded out of about $40 million, so Trumps settlement of $25 million was around 60 percent of these estimated damages.  The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad! He said in a second tweet. In announcing the settlement, Schneiderman said the deal followed repeated refusals by Trump to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university. In a statement, Schneiderman called the settlement a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university. Students had claimed they were they were lured by false promises into paying up to $35,000 to learn Trumps real estate investing secrets from his hand-picked instructors. Trumps lawyers denied this. The deal covers three lawsuits relating to Trump University: two class actions suits in California and a New York case brought by Schneiderman. U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel in San Diego must still approved the settlement. During his election campaign, Trump said that Curiel, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrant parents, could not be impartial because of Trumps campaign pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to control illegal immigration.

China state media warn Trump against renouncing free trade deals,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese state media warned U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday against flip-flopping on trade deals in Asia, as Asia-Pacific leaders gathered for a summit amid fears that growing protectionism will stunt global economic growth. During the raucous election campaign, Trump fuelled concerns among many of the United States trading partners by pledging to renegotiate trade accords such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and impose tariffs on imports from countries such as China. Turning his trade-bashing campaign talks into actual policies could bash any hope that the Asia-Pacific will finally have its much-wanted free trade deal, said a commentary in the official Xinhua news agency on Saturday. Worse, it could drag his country and the wider world into deeper economic distress, added the agency, which is a barometer of government thinking.  Xinhua also said that the exclusion of China from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement was not about boosting trade and instead was U.S. President Barack Obamas strategy to make sure Washington rules supreme in the region. Obama, Chinese President Xi Jinping and other Pacific Rim leaders are meeting at the annual Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Peru this weekend. Though Obama championed the TPP as a way to counter Chinas rise, his administration has now stopped trying to win congressional approval for the deal that was signed by 12 economies in the Americas and Asia-Pacific, but excluded China. Without U.S. approval the agreement as currently negotiated cannot come to fruition. Chinas Xi is selling an alternate vision for regional trade by promoting the Beijing-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which as it stands excludes the Americas. Chinese state media has warned Trump against isolationism and interventionism, calling instead for the United States to actively work with China to maintain the international status quo. The billionaire-turned-politician needs to prove that derailing the global economy has not been one of the reasons why he ran for U.S. president, Xinhua said.

Trump's national security adviser vows to tackle North Korea nuclear threat: Yonhap,"SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trumps national security adviser says North Koreas nuclear program would be given a high priority under the new administration, a South Korean official who held talks with him said on Saturday. Michael Flynn, one of Trumps closest advisers, also said he would work to strengthen the U.S. alliance with South Korea, calling the relationship vital, the Souths deputy presidential national security adviser Cho Tae-yong was quoted as saying by Yonhap news agency. Cho was leading a South Korean delegation to the United States to meet with key advisers to the president-elect to discuss the two countries response to the Norths pursuit of nuclear weapons in defiance of international sanctions. Cho spoke to South Korean reporters in Washington following the meeting with Flynn, Yonhap said. Flynn is a retired Army lieutenant general and a military intelligence veteran of three decades who has championed Trumps promises to take a more aggressive approach to terrorism. His appointment as national security adviser this week does not require Senate confirmation.     The North conducted its fourth and fifth nuclear tests this year under young leader Kim Jong Un, who has vowed to build a nuclear arsenal and ballistic missiles to deliver them. The U.N. Security Council has held discussions to adopt a toughened new sanctions resolution following the Norths Sept. 9 nuclear blast.  U.S. President Barack Obama has been criticized by Congressional Republicans that his policy of strategic patience was a failure and that he must make full use of sanctions authorities given to him by Congress.  Trump pledged his commitment to defend South Korea under an existing security alliance during a phone call with South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Yonhap said last week. Trump had suggested during the election campaign he would be willing to withdraw U.S. military stationed in South Korea unless Seoul paid a greater share of the cost of the deployment. There are about 28,500 U.S. troops based in South Korea in combined defense against North Korea. ",politicsNews,"November 19, 2016 ",1
Pro-business Sessions will not go easy on corporate crime: lawyers,"(Reuters) - Jeff Sessions may be known as a pro-business conservative but as U.S. attorney general he is unlikely to shy away from indicting big companies and individuals for serious white-collar crimes, legal experts said, citing his record as a lawmaker. President-elect Donald Trump on Friday named Sessions, a four-term senator from Alabama and former federal prosecutor, to lead the Justice Department. Sessions, 69, an early supporter of Trump, is expected to accept the cabinet post if confirmed. A spokesman for Sessions did not respond to a request for comment. Because of the dearth of big banks and companies in his home state, there is little in Sessions track record as a federal prosecutor and state attorney general from the 1970s to the 1990s to suggest how he might approach complex cases of corporate malfeasance. But a review of his record in the Senate indicates he will likely push for corporate indictments, instead of settling for fines, and may focus on putting more executives in prison, lawyers who specialize in white-collar crime said. For example, during a 2010 confirmation hearing for James Cole, Sessions questioned the former U.S. deputy attorney general about the dangerous philosophy of not charging companies criminally because of concerns that doing so could lead to bankruptcy and hurt employees and shareholders. Normally, I was taught if they violated a law, you charge them. If they didnt violate the law, you dont charge them, Sessions said during the hearing. Matthew Schwartz, a former federal prosecutor and lawyer at Boies, Schiller & Flexner, said Sessions remarks suggested that he may be more willing than the current administration to require a guilty plea from corporations with less concern for  collateral consequences.  He said Sessions would also likely support the Justice Departments renewed efforts to prosecute executives, outlined in a policy memo last year by Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates. While an unabashed businessman, Trump was highly critical of Hillary Clintons ties to Wall Street, accusing his Democratic rival of being beholden to the interests of big investment banks.  That message resonated with many working class voters who suffered in the financial crisis of 2008 and are still angry that no top-level Wall Street figures have been prosecuted for acts that almost brought down the global financial system.  Until we see evidence to the contrary, it appears that the new Justice Department will be one that will seek to hold every individual accountable to the fullest extent. So the stakes may be higher, Schwartz said. Jackson Sharman, a white-collar defense lawyer in Alabama, said that he believed Sessions would want to be as tough on white-collar as on street criminals. He pointed to Sessions recent opposition to a crime bill that would have shown sentencing leniency for non-violent offenders. Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor and Columbia Law School professor, who has testified before Sessions Senate Judiciary Committee, agreed that the Alabama senator will be a strong supporter of corporate enforcement. In the past, Sessions has come out in favor of tough Justice Department tactics against companies accused of fraud.  In 2007, corporate counsels pushed for a law that would have stopped the Justice Department from pressuring companies to waive attorney-client privilege during fraud investigations. But during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Sessions argued against any such rule, noting that prosecutors regularly pressure street criminals to waive constitutional rights using the threat of tougher penalties if they do not co-operate.  Sessions said the Justice Department should be able to use similar leverage against corporations.  Corporate crime is not easy to prosecute or investigate. They have the best lawyers that you can find, and they utilize all the legitimate tools that they have, Sessions said. And you have to be strong... a prosecutor cannot be a weak-kneed person going up against a major corporation in a fraud case. ",politicsNews,"November 19, 2016 ",1
"Claims of votes by the dead, felons cloud North Carolina governor race","WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - North Carolinas gubernatorial race was undecided 10 days after the Nov. 8 vote and new allegations by the Republican incumbents campaign about felons and dead people casting ballots could leave the outcome in limbo for weeks. Republican Governor Pat McCrory, trailing Democratic challenger Roy Cooper by about 6,300 votes according to the state elections website Friday afternoon, has not conceded. Under state law, Friday was the deadline for counties to certify their results. But challenges over the validity of hundreds of votes and reviews of provisional ballots were expected to delay the reports from many, if not all, of the states 100 counties, elections officials said. The uncertainty has been punctuated this week by a war of words, with McCrorys campaign accusing Cooper of being lax on voter fraud and Coopers campaign calling the incumbent dishonest and desperate. It is unfortunate to see that rather than accepting the results, Pat McCrory is going to go down by besmirching Republican election officials (and) by impugning voters, Marc Elias, a lawyer for the Cooper campaign, said in a call with reporters on Friday. McCrorys campaign, however, argues it is following the legal process to ensure all legitimate votes are counted. Protests being filed by registered voters in some 50 counties argue that up to 200 ballots should be thrown out because they were cast under the names of dead people or by felons or individuals who voted more than once, according to the campaign. McCrory representatives also said thousands of votes in 12 counties may have been part of an absentee ballot fraud scheme. Several counties rejected election protests on Friday, including Durham County, where Republicans had called into question the tabulation of about 90,000 ballots on election night, local media reported. All of the states county elections boards are controlled by Republicans. Elias said there are not enough votes at issue to keep Cooper from winning. McCrory campaign spokesman Ricky Diaz called that claim presumptuous with counting incomplete. Theres additional cases of voter fraud being discovered each day, he said in a phone interview. If McCrory trails by 10,000 or fewer votes once counties submit their final tallies, he could demand a recount. A Cooper victory would be the only governorship addition  for Democrats. Republicans, who flipped seats in New Hampshire, Missouri and Vermont, will hold at least 33 governor offices next year, the most for the party since 1922. ",politicsNews,"November 18, 2016 ",1
"Trump's CIA pick supports domestic surveillance, opposes Iran deal","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Representative Mike Pompeo, President-elect Donald Trumps surprise choice to head the CIA, supports the U.S. governments sweeping collection of Americans communications data and wants to scrap the nuclear deal with Iran. The retired Army officer, West Point and Harvard Law School graduate also has defended the CIAs use of interrogation techniques that are widely condemned as torture. The Kansas Republican has criticized Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintons use of a private email server as secretary of state and her handling of the 2012 attacks on U.S. posts in Benghazi, Libya. A member of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, Pompeo, 52, was first elected in the 2010 Tea Party wave from the congressional district centered on his hometown of Wichita. Members of both parties regard him as intelligent, collegial and capable, with a keen grasp of national security issues. Mike is very bright and hard-working, and will devote himself to helping the agency develop the best possible intelligence for policy makers, said Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee. While we have had our share of strong differences - principally on the politicization of the tragedy in Benghazi - I know that he is someone who is willing to listen and engage.  Pompeo is a serious guy who studies issues carefully, said former National Security Agency and CIA director Michael Hayden. Some civil liberties and human rights advocates, however, expressed concern over Pompeos selection because he opposes  closing the Guantanamo Bay detention center. They also criticized his support for the National Security Agencys now-defunct bulk communications metadata collection and other surveillance programs. These positions and others merit serious public scrutiny through a confirmation process, said Anthony Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. In a January op-ed in the Wall Street Journal he co-authored, Pompeo called for a fundamental upgrade to Americas surveillance capabilities, including resuming bulk collection of domestic phone metadata, the numbers and time stamps of calls, but not their content.  The program, which a federal appeals court and two governmental review panels found to be illegal and ineffective, should be expanded to include publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a comprehensive, searchable database, and that legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance should be removed, he wrote. He also called for the death penalty for Edward Snowden, the NSA contractor who disclosed the existence of the metadata program and other top-secret surveillance programs.    Pompeo stands a good chance of being confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. Announcement of his nomination was warmly greeted by Senator Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which will conduct his confirmation hearing.  Pompeo has been at the forefront of attacks in Congress on Clinton, accusing her of criminality for storing emails containing classified information on her private server. He served on the Republican-led House committee that investigated the attacks by Islamist extremists on U.S. diplomatic and CIA posts in Benghazi that killed four Americans. While the panel found no wrongdoing by the administration, Pompeo and another member appended to the final report a commentary accusing Clinton and other officials of failing to protect the posts and to respond appropriately to the attacks.     Democrats accused Pompeo of using inaccurate information to exaggerate alleged failures by Clinton on Benghazi.Some of Pompeos positions also are at odds with the assessments of the intelligence officers and analysts Trump wants him to command. While he has argued that the CIAs use of harsh interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, which simulates drowning, produced useful intelligence, current CIA Director John Brennan has said he would resign if he were ordered to resume the practice. Other CIA and military officers and FBI agents have said so-called enhanced interrogation techniques do not produce reliable information because prisoners will say anything to end their suffering, as one CIA official put it. Pompeo also is at odds with the intelligence communitys assessment of the 2015 deal that lifted financial sanctions from Iran in return for limits on its nuclear program. He has vowed to overturn the deal, and suggested in a 2014 roundtable with journalists that the United States should bomb Irans nuclear facilities, a proposal that U.S. intelligence experts said would only delay Tehrans development of a warhead, not halt it. Pompeo also has opposed the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, while at the CIA, a recently created Mission Center for Global Issues tracks global warming as a threat to U.S. security. He has taken positions that are at odds with Trumps, notably on Russias actions in Ukraine and its military support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who also is supported by Iran. Russia has established a toehold in the Middle East, and we now have the Iranian-Russian axis there largely running free, Pompeo told a security forum in 2015. Pompeo, who was born in California, graduated first in his class from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and was an artillery officer in the army for five years. He received a degree from the Harvard Law School and was an editor of the prestigious Harvard Law Review.     ",politicsNews,"November 18, 2016 ",1
A surge in U.S. deportations could swamp an overtaxed system,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trumps plan to rapidly deport 2 to 3 million illegal immigrants with criminal records would further tax a system already stretched to its limits, current and former U.S. immigration officials say. Immigration courts, which issue deportation orders, set bond and grant or deny asylum, currently have a backlog of more than 500,000 cases.  Boosting staff could help address the problem but that could prove difficult. Officials at the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security say they have had trouble quickly finding and vetting enough qualified candidates to fill all the positions for judges and immigration agents that Congress has authorized. The Executive Office of Immigration Review, which adjudicates immigration cases, has so far been able to fill only 294 judge positions out of the 374 Congress has authorized because the process is slow by necessity. Candidates for the job face a rigorous screening process comparable to that of the appointment of a U.S. attorney, said spokeswoman Kathryn Mattingly.  Trump said last week after his election victory that once he takes office he will move to deport or incarcerate up to 3 million illegal immigrants who have criminal records.     At U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a force of 6,200 agents responsible for arresting and deporting criminal migrants is already spread thin. While some agents could be redeployed to other areas, more agents would likely need to be hired if deportations were sharply escalated, said an Immigrationand Customs Enforcement official who asked not to named. The agency would probably need to add detention space as well, the official added.  More apprehensions of migrants could also strain the Border Patrol, which has struggled to fill open positions. Congress has mandated a force of more than 21,000 border agents, but it currently stands at just over 19,000. Former U.S. Border Patrol chief Mike Fisher said the agency ran into problems a decade ago after Congress asked it to double the number of Border Patrol agents from 6,000 to 12,000 between 2004 and 2006. The push to hire quickly helped fuel corruption, a March 2016 report by the Department of Homeland Securitys independent advisory council found.   The report concluded that the rapid hiring was exploited by Mexican drug gangs, which sent in cartel-friendly applicants for the patrol jobs. Once hired, they then facilitated drug smuggling across the U.S.-Mexico border. The agency began using polygraph tests in 2010 to weed out applicants with criminal histories or ties to cartels. Fisher said the testing made it harder to find qualified candidates, estimating that by the time he left in 2015, the border patrol made one hire out of every 100 applicants. I cant imagine if they said double it now, Fisher said.  Trump could try to change laws and procedures to expedite deportation processes, which could reduce the need for additional personnel.  On Friday, Trump tapped Republican Senator Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. Sessions has supported Trumps plan to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico and undo Obamas executive actions on immigration.  During President Barack Obamas time in office, the United States has deported about 2.5 million illegal immigrants, more than under any other president. ",politicsNews,"November 18, 2016 ",1
Trump agrees to pay $25 million to settle Trump University lawsuits,"NEW YORK/SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - Donald Trump agreed on Friday to pay $25 million to settle fraud lawsuits over his Trump University real estate seminars, in what New Yorks attorney general called a stunning reversal for the U.S. president-elect. The lawsuits had dogged Trump, who denied any wrongdoing,  throughout his campaign. They led to one of the more controversial moments of his run when he claimed the judge overseeing two of the cases was biased because he was of Mexican ancestry. The settlement was announced by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who said it followed repeated refusals by Trump to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university. Lawyers for Trump had argued against students, who claimed they were they were lured by false promises into paying up to $35,000 to learn Trumps real estate investing secrets from his hand-picked instructors. Three lawsuits relating to Trump University will be covered by the deal: two class actions suits in California and a New York case brought by Schneiderman. The agreement must still be approved by U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel in San Diego. Trump will not admit any wrongdoing under the agreement. His attorney, Daniel Petrocelli, acknowledged Trump had previously vowed to fight the case. The settlement demonstrated Trumps desire to set his personal feelings aside in order to work on issues facing the county, Petrocelli said. President-elect Trump has laser focus on moving forward. Its time to move on, Petrocelli told reporters on Friday. Schneiderman and attorneys for the students praised the deal. Todays $25 million settlement agreement is a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university, Schneiderman said in a statement. At a court hearing on Friday, students attorney Jason Forge said that out of the $25 million proposed settlement, $4 million will be earmarked for students represented by Schneiderman who were not part of the California class actions, as well as administrative costs. Class action lawyers for the students will not seek attorneys fees, but reimbursement for costs, he said.  Curiel, who is presiding over the two California cases, had urged both sides to settle. Trump said during his election campaign that Curiel, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrant parents, could not be impartial because of Trumps campaign pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to control illegal immigration. In court on Friday, Trump lawyer Petrocelli praised Curiel for his hard work on the case.  Curiel said he hoped the settlement could be part of a healing process after the U.S. election that this country very sorely needs. ",politicsNews,"November 18, 2016 ",1

"With Trump victory, blunt U.S. general gets second chance","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - On his way to the polls on election day, Michael Flynn pulled out his phone and took a video of himself saying his vote for Donald Trump was part of a larger fight against the dishonesty and deceit of our government. For Flynn, a retired U.S. Army three-star general and one of Trumps closest advisers, it was another parting shot at an administration he thinks unfairly fired him from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in 2014 for telling hard truths about the war on Islamist extremism. Named on Thursday to become Trumps national security adviser, Flynn is now poised for a second act in public life  and he has promised nothing short of an upheaval.    We just went through a revolution, Flynn, 57, told a forum on Saturday. This is probably the biggest election in our nations history, since bringing on George Washington when he decided not to be a king. Thats how important this is. Flynns advocates say his experience battling radical Islamist militants in Iraq and Afghanistan, along with candor that has ruffled feathers in Washington more than once, makes him the kind of ally Trump needs on his national security team. David Deptula, a retired Air Force lieutenant general who used to work with Flynn, praised his willingness to speak truth to power and not politicize his answers. Mike Flynn is a straight shooter and a no-bullshit kind of guy. And thats exactly what we need in terms of senior leaders giving advice to the national leadership, Deptula said. His critics voice concerns about a management style that alienated some of his subordinates at DIA, a lumbering bureaucracy that Flynn sought to shake up. Thats an explanation some gave for why he was pushed into retirement. Flynn could not be reached for comment. Several former U.S. officials who worked closely with Flynn described him as extremely smart but a poor manager who advocated a precipitous overhaul of the DIA that ignited hostility and resistance from veteran intelligence officials. Flynn understood that DIA was a mess, one said. But he telegraphed his intent for radical change in a way that he immediately created resistance to his ideas, no matter their merits. Two other former officials also said they had concerns about Flynns management style, a potential liability in a White House job that requires coordinating U.S. policy and resolving disagreements among senior officials at different agencies. One of the officials said senior career DIA officials and other agency employees held Flynn responsible for an offensive Dress for Success presentation that was distributed to the workforce in January 2013. It recommended gender-specific fashion guidelines, urged people to consider your body type and said makeup made women more attractive.  Flynn apologized for the presentation in a subsequent memo that said neither he nor the agency condone this briefing. Flynns policy views suggest he will take a more aggressive approach against Islamist militants. Former colleagues expect his effort to bolster Americas battle against jihadists to be shaped by his belief that the United States is losing a global war against Islamist extremism that may last for generations. In a new book Flynn co-authored, he prescribes a harder political line on Iran, including information warfare to expose shortcomings in Irans revolution. Like Trump, Flynn calls the 2003 invasion of Iraq a strategic blunder and says that energy should have been directed instead toward political support for opponents of Irans theocratic rulers. He shares Trumps vision of warmer relations with Israel  but also advocates stronger ties with Egypt, whose autocratic president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, ousted the Muslim Brotherhood and was the first world leader to congratulate Trump on his victory. Flynns appearances on Russias government-run broadcaster RT, particularly at a gala last year attended by President Vladimir Putin, have also raised eyebrows in military circles.  However, he has also expressed skepticism about Moscows intentions - a view that does not seem to fit Trumps vision of a new era of detente with the Kremlin.  Although he has more experience battling the Taliban, al Qaeda and other militant groups than anyone else in Trumps inner circle, Flynns critics in the intelligence community and the military question whether his ouster from the DIA has changed him. The whole experience seems to have made him bitter, said another former U.S. official who worked with Flynn and spoke on condition of anonymity. Representative Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee, questioned Flynns temperament, saying Trump needs someone more steady and thorough in their analysis to temper him.  Im not sure thats what you get with General Flynn. And I would be worried about an impulsive president with an impulsive security adviser, Schiff told CNN. Former colleagues are alarmed by his adoption of Trumps divisive campaign rhetoric - including leading chants of Lock Her Up! aimed at Hillary Clinton during the Republican National Convention and saying on Twitter Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL. I think what you have is frustration that eventually turns to anger after he leaves, said this former U.S. official. He was frustrated over DIA; he was frustrated over administration policy toward Syria; and hes frustrated and angry over his removal from the Department of Defense.

"Factbox: The nasty things Trump, Romney have said about each other","(Reuters) - Even for a 2016 election campaign marked by rhetorical invective, the remarks President-elect Donald Trump and Mitt Romney made about each other in the run-up to the Nov. 8 vote were especially harsh.  Those exchanges make all the more significant Trumps plan to meet Romney, the unsuccessful 2012 Republican presidential candidate, on Saturday. A source familiar with the meeting said they may discuss whether Romney should be considered for secretary of state in a Trump administration.  Here are some of the things, kind and unkind, that Trump and Romney have said about each other. * Governor Romney, go out and get em. You can do it. - Trump endorsing Romney in February 2012 * Donald Trump has shown an extraordinary ability to understand how our economy works ... It means a great deal to me to have the endorsement of Mr. Trump. - Romney accepting the 2012 endorsement * Dishonesty is Donald Trumps hallmark. - Romney speaking at a political forum in Utah in March * He was begging for my endorsement. I couldve said, Mitt, drop to your knees, and he wouldve dropped to his knees. - Trump at a March campaign rally responding to the Romney speech and describing how Romney had sought his endorsement in 2012 * Think of Donald Trumps personal qualities. The bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd third-grade theatrics. Now, imagine your children and your grandchildren acting the way he does. - Romneys anti-Trump speech in March * He failed horribly ... Mitt is indeed a choke artist. - Trump in March assessing Romneys presidential run * Heres what I know. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. - Romney in March * Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist - but I am least racist person there is. - Trump tweet in June * I think his comments time and again appeal to the racist tendency that exists in some people and I think thats dangerous. - Romney in a CNN interview in June * Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice! - Trump tweet five days after the Nov. 8 election     ",politicsNews,"November 18, 2016 ",1
Most Americans back 'just the facts' news stories: Pew survey,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Most Americans want the media to present facts in news stories without adding interpretation, a Pew Research Center survey said on Friday amid a debate in the media about its role in covering Donald Trumps unconventional presidential campaign. Journalists face the issue of how much guidance they should provide to help their audiences make sense of the news. The question is especially keen after the 2016 election when the media grappled with challenging false statements made by Republican Trump in his campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Fifty-nine percent of U.S. adults reject the idea of adding interpretation, saying that the news media should present the facts alone, the survey showed. Four in 10 favored adding some interpretation to the facts. Although the public prefers the news media to present just the facts, they may not even agree on what the facts are, Pew said in a statement. In the same survey, 81 percent of registered voters said that most supporters of Clinton and Trump not only disagreed over plans and policies, but also disagreed on basic facts. Voters who supported Trump, now the president-elect, favored a just the facts approach by 71 percent to 29 percent. Clinton supporters were evenly split on the issue. The survey showed strong support for fact-checking by the media. The election campaign saw a proliferation of fake news sites and articles on social media competing with news published by traditional media, although this was not included in the survey. Eighty-one percent of those who prefer facts without interpretation believe fact-checking is a major or minor responsibility of the news media. Among those who prefer interpretation, 83 percent think fact-checking is a responsibility. The survey of 4,132 adults was conducted from Sept. 27 to Oct. 10, before Election Day. The margin of error is 2.8 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"November 18, 2016 ",1
Conservatives have concerns about Sessions as Trump's attorney general,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump on Friday named his earliest and staunchest supporter in the Senate, conservative Republican Jeff Sessions, to become the next U.S. attorney general, triggering an outcry from civil rights groups as well as some conservatives outside Congress who are uneasy about Sessions positions. If approved for the job by a simple majority in the Republican-dominated Senate, Sessions, 69, would lead the Justice Department and the FBI. He brings a record of controversial positions on race, immigration and criminal justice reform that Democrats may target. Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and Trump critic, said on Twitter, Jeff Sessions, considered too racist to be a judge in the 80s, is Trumps AG. Holly Harris, executive director of U.S. Justice Action Network, a sentencing reform advocacy group that includes powerful conservative tax reform lobbyist Grover Norquist, said Sessions nomination obviously presents a challenge. Sessions has opposed lowering mandatory minimum sentences for low-level offenders.   Many civil rights and immigration groups also have concerns about Sessions with the American Civil Liberties Union saying his positions on gay rights, capital punishment, abortion rights and presidential authority in times of war should be examined. Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told Reuters: Our nation deserves an attorney general who will be committed to enforcement of our nations civil rights laws and who will not turn the clock back on progress that has been made. Trump spokesman Jason Miller defended Sessions against allegations of racism, saying: When Senator Sessions was U.S. attorney he filed a number of desegregation lawsuits in Alabama, and he also voted in favor of the 30-year extension of the Civil Rights Act... So we feel very confident that Senator Sessions has the background and the support to receive confirmation. Sessions office did not respond to a request for comment on his nomination or criticism. Sessions was a federal prosecutor in 1986 when he became only the second nominee in 50 years to be denied confirmation as a federal judge. This came after allegations that he had made racist remarks, including testimony that he had called an African-American prosecutor boy, an allegation Sessions denied. Sessions said he was not a racist, but he said at his hearing that groups such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union could be considered un-American. He also acknowledged he had called the Voting Rights Act of 1965 a piece of intrusive legislation. Sessions, a four-term senator from Alabama, has friends on Capitol Hill. Convivial, with a pixie-like demeanor and soft Southern accent, his gentle manner belies his hard-line positions. No members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will hold Sessions confirmation hearing, had expressed outright opposition to his nomination as of Friday morning, but many Democrats said he would get a thorough and tough confirmation hearing.  Given some of his past statements and his staunch opposition to immigration reform, I am very concerned about what he would do with the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice and want to hear what he has to say, said Charles Schumer, the newly elected Democratic Senate leader. Judiciary Committee member Senator Jeff Flake, a moderate Republican on immigration issues and a long-time critic of Trump, said on Twitter that he will support Sessions, who he said is well regarded, even by those who dont always agree with him. The Justice Department under Democratic President Barack Obama has been criticized for siding with protesters over police in matters of racial profiling or unlawful use of force. His Justice Department opened investigations of 23 police departments around the country for patterns of civil rights violations and Sessions, as attorney general, would have the discretion to drop investigations that are still open. Jim Pasco, the executive director of Fraternal Order of Police, the nations largest police union, said police have had a good relationship working with Sessions, especially on policies that allow police to keep assets seized from criminals.  The door (to Sessions) has been open and we expect it to remain open, Pasco said.  Sessions hard-line and at times inflammatory statements on immigration are similar to Trumps but have angered other members of Congress. He opposes a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and was an enthusiastic backer of Trumps promise to build a wall on the border with Mexico. As a senator, Sessions opposed Obamas nomination of Loretta Lynch as attorney general on the grounds that she would carry out an Obama immigration policy that shielded many undocumented immigrants from deportation. Sessions also has questioned the 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to everyone born in the United States, and opposes plans to admit more immigrants from war-torn Middle Eastern countries. As attorney general, Sessions would be able to turn more to state governments to enforce federal immigration laws.  He also could increase enforcement on companies that outsource technology jobs. As a senator, Sessions criticized U.S. companies that brought guest workers to the United States on temporary visas.  Sessions first endorsed Trumps presidential bid in February, surprising those who had expected him to embrace Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a fellow Southerner and the favorite of the chambers most conservative wing. Sessions was Trumps only backer in the Senate for months and became a powerful member of his inner circle. He has led Trumps national security committee since March and was named vice chairman of the transitions executive committee last week. Sessions defended Trump in October when a leaked video showed him bragging about groping women, leading dozens of Republican officials to drop their support. ",politicsNews,"November 18, 2016 ",1
"Obama, EU leaders agree to stick together, stay tough on Russia","BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama and European leaders on Friday underscored the importance of working together in NATO and chided Russia for its bombing of Syria and failure to implement a Ukrainian peace accord. The White House statement followed a meeting at which Obama sought to reassure his counterparts from Germany, Britain, Spain, Italy and France that his successor Donald Trump would not break up the transatlantic alliance. Trump raised concerns during the campaign when he said he could withhold military aid from NATO allies if they had not met their defense commitments and said he would forge closer ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. President Obama expressed confidence that, even at a moment of great change, democratic values have done more to advance human freedom and progress than any other system in history, and will continue to do so going forward, the White House said. The leaders agreed on the need to work together to stabilize the Middle East and North Africa, as well as securing diplomatic resolutions for the conflicts in Syria and eastern Ukraine. European leaders had sought Obamas support as they prepare to extend sanctions imposed on Russia by Washington and Brussels in 2014 following its intervention in eastern Ukraine, and consider fresh sanctions over Russias actions in Syria, where it backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a news conference with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy that no decisions had been made about extending the Ukraine sanctions, but actions to implement the Minsk peace accord were not sufficient. Merkel said the leaders discussed their concerns about Syria during their meeting on Friday, but did not talk about imposing Syria-related sanctions against Russia that have been sought by the Syrian opposition. Obama and the EU leaders called for an immediate end to attacks on rebel-held parts of the city of Aleppo by Syrian government forces and their allies Russia and Iran that monitoring groups say have killed dozens this week alone. Syrian opposition officials on Friday met EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and other officials and urged them to focus on protecting civilians and lifting the siege, said Anas al-Abdah, who heads the Syrian National Coalition. He said he had hoped for stronger words from Obama and the EU leaders, and called for Washington and Brussels to put more real pressure on Russia and Iran. U.S. and EU officials have stressed the need for a political solution, including the departure of Assad, but Trump has said he views the fight against Islamic State as a bigger priority. EU leaders are expected to extend sanctions related to Ukraine in December or January. Obama and the European leaders unanimously agreed on the continued need for Russia to fully meet its commitments under the Minsk agreements and that Ukraine-related sanctions against Russia must remain in place until it does so, the White House said. They said a durable ceasefire in eastern Ukraine was needed to move forward with free and fair local elections in the occupied regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.

'First line of defense': Democratic states vow to fight Trump in court,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic attorneys general in at least five U.S. states have vowed to fight President-elect Donald Trump in the courts if he rolls back Obama-era regulations or adopts policies they view as infringing upon civil liberties. With Republicans controlling the White House and both chambers of Congress, the Democratic Party looks set to rely more heavily on top law officials in states they run to help keep a check on Trumps exercise of power. Any efforts by a Trump administration to weaken consumer protection or climate change policies, for example, could lead to conflict between the states and the federal government, attorney general offices in Maryland, Virginia, Washington, Massachusetts, and New York told Reuters. In some instances, that could see them asking a federal judge to block federal action nationwide.  I view my role as being on the first line of defense against a Trump administration if it chooses to act in an unconstitutional fashion, said Bob Ferguson, the Democratic attorney general of Washington state. When George W. Bush was president, Democratic states forced his administration to take the first step toward regulating carbon emissions for the first time.  Michael Kelly, a spokesman for Virginias attorney general, Mark Herring, said that if a Trump administration crosses the line and pursues actions that are illegal or violate the Constitution, Attorney General Herring will be ready to stand up and defend the rights of Virginians.  The Trump transition team did not respond to a request seeking comment. Attorneys general are the top legal officials in the 50 states and are typically elected. After this years elections, 21 will be Democrats, in addition to the attorney general for the District of Columbia.  Acting on behalf of their states, they generally have legal standing to bring lawsuits challenging federal regulations or executive actions, including those that may infringe upon civil rights. The President-elect has made a number of promises that, if implemented, would violate the Constitution or Massachusetts law, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement. If the incoming administration chooses to try to act in ways that are unconstitutional, my office will take action to protect the rights and liberties of our residents and our state, she said. A dozen attorney general offices contacted by Reuters declined to discuss potential legal strategies before Trump takes office. Democratic states that sue might initially get a sympathetic hearing, as many federal courts are staffed with judges appointed by President Barack Obama during his eight years in office.  But challengers face one major obstacle, a Supreme Court likely soon to regain its conservative majority once Trump makes an appointment to fill a vacant seat. The court is currently divided 4-4 between conservatives and liberals. Republican-controlled Texas, which took a leading role in challenging Obamas executive actions, provides a model for the Democratic attorneys general.  Climate change is likely to be area of friction between Trump, who has vowed to roll back regulations aimed at cutting greenhouse gases, and Democratic states, which have supported such efforts at the federal level or enacted their own measures. The top target for Trump is Obamas Clean Power Plan, which seeks to limit carbon emissions from power plants. Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said his office will continue to fight to protect New Yorkers public health, property, and environment, and to lead the coalition of states defending the Clean Power Plan. Immigration policy is another potential flashpoint. Trump has said he will rescind an Obama executive order giving deportation relief to up to 4 million people and end federal funding for cities like New York and Los Angeles that give sanctuary to undocumented immigrants.  A federal court blocked the Obama executive order in February 2015 after Texas and 25 other Republican states challenged it. The Supreme Court split 4-4 on the issue in June, leaving the lower courts ruling in place. On consumer protection, states can both challenge any Trump efforts to loosen regulations and ramp up their own enforcement efforts, said Doug Gansler, a Democrat who served as Marylands attorney general from 2007 to 2015. If the federal government abdicates that responsibility, the more aggressive and progressive state attorneys general will fill that vacuum, he said. ",politicsNews,"November 18, 2016 ",1
Top Senate Democrat cites civil rights concerns with Trump pick Sessions,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Incoming U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer on Friday said he is very concerned about Republican U.S. President-elect Donald Trumps selection of Senator Jeff Sessions as attorney general and indicated there would be tough questioning in the chambers confirmation process. Given some of his past statements and his staunch opposition to immigration reform, I am very concerned about what he would do with the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice and want to hear what he has to say, Schumer said in a statement.

"Factbox: Trump makes picks to fill security, legal posts","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Friday announced his selections for his top security posts, including the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), his national security adviser and attorney general. An official with Trumps transition team told Reuters that Trump had chosen retired General Michael Flynn as national security adviser, U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions to serve as attorney general, and U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo to lead the CIA. All three accepted, the official said.      Below are details about his selections: Sessions, 69, was the first U.S. Senator to endorse Trumps presidential bid and has been a close ally since. A conservative from Alabama, he is serving his fourth term in the chamber, where he is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee with oversight of federal courts, immigration, crime and terrorism.  The son of a country-store owner, he is a former Army Reserve captain and served as the U.S. Attorney for Alabamas Southern District under former President Ronald Reagan and later as Alabamas Attorney General.  Although he was confirmed by the Senate for his U.S. Attorney post in 1981, he was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 when a Senate panel failed to advance his nomination amid allegations he had made racially-charged remarks, which he denied.  Sessions must secure confirmation by the U.S. Senate to lead the Justice Department as attorney general, but he would only need to win majority support in the chamber, which is controlled by Republicans. Sessions has long taken a tough stance on immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. During the Republican George W. Bush administration, he blasted a bipartisan effort to create a guest-worker program for illegal immigrants backed by Bush. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: RETIRED LIEUTENANT GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN Flynn, 57, was an early supporter of Trump and serves as vice chairman on his transition team. A former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), he began his U.S. Army career in 1981 and served deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. He later worked in the Office of the Director of Intelligence.        Once a registered Democrat, Flynn became head of the DIA in 2012 under President Barack Obama and but retired a year earlier than expected according to media reports and became a fierce critic of Obamas foreign policy.  He went on to launch his own consulting firm that has come under scrutiny for its ties to a Turkish businessman. He told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday that he would sever ties with the firm to serve Trump.     Flynn has said the United States should work more with Russia on global security issues. In an August interview with the Washington Post, he defended a paid speech for state-run Russian Television.     Pompeo, 52, is a third-term congressman from Kansas who serves on the U.S House Select Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA, National Security Agency (NSA) and cyber security. Pompeo also was a member of the House Select Committee on Benghazi investigating the 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Libya.  The California native graduated first in his class from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and served as a platoon leader in the U.S. Army before leaving military as a captain to attend Harvard Law School. In 1996, he moved to Kansas to launch an aircraft parts company. The firms decision to open a factory in Mexico came under fire when Pompeo later ran for public office. Pompeo defended his work, saying the company had created jobs in the state. His ties to Koch Industries, owned by billionaire conservative donors Charles and David Koch, has also drawn scrutiny. He won re-election in the Nov. 8 election with 61 percent of the vote, according to Kansass unofficial election results online. Pompeo has been critical of former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden who leaked National Security Agency information, saying in a 2014 letter that his telecast appearance at an event undermined the ideals of fairness and freedom.

"Japan's PM Abe meets Trump, says confident can build trust","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Japans Prime Minister Shinzo Abe described Donald Trump as a trustworthy leader after meeting the U.S. president-elect on Thursday to get clarity on statements Trump had made while campaigning that had caused concern about the alliance. Abe, speaking after the hastily arranged 90-minute meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan, reporters: The talks made me feel sure that we can build a relationship of trust. But he would not disclose specifics because the conversation was unofficial. Trump, in a brief entry on his Facebook page accompanied by a photo of the two men, said: It was a pleasure to have Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stop by my home and begin a great friendship. Japans leadership has been nervous about the future of an alliance that is core to Tokyos diplomacy and security. Trump had fanned worries in Tokyo and beyond with comments on the possibility of Japan acquiring nuclear arms, demands that allies pay more for keeping U.S. forces on their soil or face their possible withdrawal, and his opposition to the U.S.-led 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade pact. Abe had worked closely with President Barack Obama on the TPP trade pact, which was part of Obamas push to counter the rising strength of China and a pillar of Abes economic reforms. Alliances cannot function without trust. I am now confident that President-elect Trump is a trustworthy leader, said Abe, describing the talks as candid and held in a warm atmosphere. Abe gave Trump a golf driver and received golf-wear in return, Japanese officials said. Photographs taken inside the ornate meeting room at Trump Tower showed Abe accompanied only by an interpreter and Trump by his daughter Ivanka, her husband and Trump adviser Jared Kushner, and Retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn whom a senior Trump official said on Thursday had been offered the national security adviser position. Abe said he had agreed to meet again with Trump at a convenient time to cover a wider area in greater depth. It was unclear if that would happen before Trumps inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump official Kellyanne Conway told CBS earlier on Thursday that any deeper conversations about policy and the relationship between Japan and the United States will have to wait until after the inauguration. Back in Tokyo, Finance Minister Taro Aso commented: The meeting ran longer than planned, which means that they were on the same wavelength and it went well. Some of Trumps campaign rhetoric suggested an image of Japan forged in the 1980s, when Tokyo was seen by many in the United States as a threat to jobs and a free-rider on defense. A Trump adviser who spoke earlier in the week, however, stressed a more positive view and credited Abe with making changes. Frankly, the prime minister has been more assertive and forthright in trying to make those changes to Japans global posture, he said.  Trump, a brash billionaire real estate magnate, and Abe, a political blue blood, share a stated desire to raise their countries global standing and both have support from right-wing constituencies. Abe has boosted Japans overall defense spending since taking office in 2012. He has also stretched the limits of its pacifist postwar constitution to allow the military to take a bigger global role. Japans defense spending, though, still stands at just over 1 percent of GDP compared with more than 3 percent in the United States. Abe was expected to see Obama at an Asia-Pacific summit in Peru on the weekend. Hours before Abe and Trump met, Obamas secretary of state, John Kerry, and Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida met in Lima to discuss the Paris climate accord - a deal Trump has pledged to exit. Diplomats and analysts say that however good the atmospherics, it will be hard to assess Trumps policies on security issues ranging from overseas deployments of U.S. troops, Chinas maritime assertiveness and the North Korean nuclear threat until Trump makes key appointments.

Can Trump make coal great again? At least some companies think so,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Most of the U.S. coal industry doubts Donald Trump can fulfill his promise to make the ailing industry great again in a country awash in dirt-cheap natural gas, a competing fuel.  But a small sub-section of the coal sector that mines metallurgical coal - a variety used by steel makers instead of power plants - is gearing up for a Trump-inspired boom. Thats because the Republican president-elect has promised a spending surge for roads, bridges and tunnels after he takes office on Jan. 20, a push to upgrade Americas infrastructure with the support of leading Democrats that could jolt demand for metallurgical coal from American steel mills. Prices for met coal, as it is called, have already risen in recent months on lower supply from China. This is the best news that Appalachia as a whole has had in about 10 years, said Jason Bostic, a vice president at the West Virginia Coal Association, referring to Trumps infrastructure agenda. Suddenly theres a little bit of hope here. Corsa Coal Corp, a producer of met coal based in Pennsylvania, was already encouraged by the China-driven price spike before Trumps victory. Now it believes U.S. politics are going its way too. The thing that has got me the most excited is the potential for infrastructure spending, said George Dethlefsen, Corsas chief executive. All those things are very energy- and steel-intensive, and thats good for our business. The company  plans to boost its production of met coal by 70 percent in 2017 to around 1.2 million short tons. In the meantime, it is putting mines on a six-day-a-week schedule, up from four days, and it is looking at loading coal on its midnight shift, which it normally reserves for maintenance. Arch Coal Inc, which produces both met and steam coal used in power plants, said it was also optimistic about Trump, particularly his promise to roll back regulations. But other representatives of the steam coal industry have said regulation reversals may not overcome their main problem: plentiful and cheap natural gas following a decade-long hydraulic fracturing drilling boom. National production figures for met coal are unavailable, since the government does not break the data out. But total U.S. coal production has fallen to its lowest level since 1986, costing the industry thousands of jobs, as low natural gas prices and President Barack Obamas emissions and water regulations took their toll. Met coal prices, however, reflect the coal sectors only major sign of life this year. They have risen to above $270 a metric ton this month from lows of $70 a ton in February, driven in part by China reducing its output. Corsa and Arch are among a very small number of U.S. met coal producers that are publicly traded, with most of the others small and privately owned. Alpha Natural Resources, which emerged from bankruptcy in July, declined to comment.  Trumps transition team is weighing an infrastructure bank to make investments in projects as part of an economic focus that also includes revamping taxes and regulation, a Trump adviser said this week. Democrats, including Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, have indicated they hope to work quickly with Trump on infrastructure. But whether they will succeed is far from certain, as many Republicans oppose spending bills. Ramaco, a private company, announced in September it will open two met coal mines in West Virginia and Virginia next year, thanks to $90 million in private equity investments that came in as global met coal prices swung upward. Randy Atkins, the chairman and chief executive of Ramaco, said adding new mines was possible if Trumps U.S. infrastructure push succeeds but would depend on whether additional investors flock in to fund them. Banks and financial institutions are sensitive to recent bankruptcies of major coal companies - including Arch and Peabody Energy Corp - and the weak financial conditions of others, Atkins said. Jim Truman, the director of global metallurgical coal markets at research group Wood Mackenzie, said the specialized workers that would be required, such as underground electricians, could also be hard to find given coals downturn since 2008. Phil Smith, a spokesman for the United Mine Workers of America, said the other key to the U.S. met coal industrys outlook is whether new infrastructure relies on American-made steel and coal as Trump has promised. If we are importing the coal or importing steel made with foreign coal, then it wont make any difference for American miners, Smith said. ",politicsNews,"November 18, 2016 ",1

Trump lawyers aim to delay fraud trial at hearing,"(Reuters) - Attorneys for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will try at a court hearing on Friday to delay a civil trial involving allegations from students that they were defrauded by the now-defunct Trump University.  The former students say they were lured by false promises to pay up to $35,000 to learn the New York businessmans real estate investing secrets from his hand-picked instructors. Trump owned 92 percent of Trump University and had control over all major decisions, the students court papers said.  Trump denies the allegations and has argued he relied on others to manage the business. U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel in San Diego has urged both sides to settle in advance of a trial scheduled to begin on Nov. 28. Trumps lawyers filed a motion last week asking to delay the case until after Trumps Jan. 20 inauguration, saying the presidential transition was all-consuming. They also proposed that Trumps trial testimony be recorded before trial.  The students opposed the request, saying Trump had already provided several hours of deposition testimony that could be presented to a jury.  Any delay would be a slippery slope because President-Elect Trumps life is only going to get more complicated and unpredictable as time goes by, they wrote. Curiel is presiding over two cases against Trump and the university. A separate lawsuit is pending, filed by New Yorks attorney general who has said over 5,000 students across the country were defrauded out of about $40 million. Trump aroused controversy earlier this year when he said during his campaign that Curiel, who was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrant parents, could not be impartial because of Trumps pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump may discuss secretary of state job with critic Romney: source,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump planned a Saturday meeting with Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and fierce Trump critic, and may discuss whether he should be a candidate for secretary of state, a source familiar with the meeting said on Thursday. Trump already has a lengthy list of potential candidates for the post of top U.S. diplomat, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, U.S. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who met Trump on Thursday. Trump, a former reality TV star, has shown a flair for the dramatic in his deliberations over his Cabinet, saying only he knows who the finalists are. Corker told CNN on Wednesday he was in the mix for the position but that Trump might pick someone who was closer to him during the presidential campaign. He met on Thursday in Washington with Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Trumps expected meeting with Romney amounts to an olive branch of sorts to one of his sharpest critics. Romney, who in a speech in March called Trump a phony, a fraud, urged Republicans to vote for anyone but the New York real estate magnate while the party was picking its presidential nominee. Trump, in turn, used harsh rhetoric at times during his campaign to dismiss Romney as a failure who blew a chance in 2012 to defeat Democratic President Barack Obama, whom Trump felt was a weak opponent. The source told Reuters that a broad discussion was expected during the meeting and that discussion about the secretary of state position was possible. The source had said earlier his understanding was that the meeting would occur on Sunday. Asked about the meeting, Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway suggested it was still being arranged. Were working on it, she said.  I think its good that the president-elect is meeting with people like Mr. Romney, U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, one of Trumps closest confidants and a potential nominee for defense secretary, told reporters at Manhattans Trump Tower. Sessions sounded far from certain Romney would be offered a job. There are a lot of talented people that he (Trump) needs good relationships with. And I think Mr. Romney would be quite capable of doing a number of things. But he will be one of those, I am sure, thats reviewed. Donald Trump will make that decision, Sessions said. When Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, opted out of running for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, people close to him suggested that serving as secretary of state might be appealing to him if a Republican won the presidency. A steady stream of potential Trump administration hires made their way through the lobby of Trump Tower to meet with either Trump or officials close to him. All indicated a willingness to serve, such as Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. He is a potential treasury secretary in the Trump administration. I stand ready to help the president in any capacity possible.

Ford tells Trump no Lincoln SUV production going to Mexico,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Ford Motor Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr told him the automaker would not move a Kentucky plant to Mexico, but the firm said it informed him the decision was to keep one vehicle in U.S. production. On Thursday, Trump posted on Twitter: I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!  He will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico, the President-elect tweeted. But Ford has repeatedly said it has no plans to close any U.S. plants and likely could not do so under the terms of the current United Auto Workers contract that expires in 2019. This is not the first time Trumps comments about Ford production have been called into question. Last year, he took credit for Ford moving work from Mexico to Ohio, while the automaker had already made the decision in 2011 - long before Trump announced a run for president. Spokeswoman Christin Baker said Ford confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky.  We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States, she added, in a statement. The company builds both the Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC SUV at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky, which Trump refers to as the Lincoln plant and where Ford employs about 4,700 people. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs. It is not clear how many jobs would have been impacted if the low-selling MKC had moved to Mexico.  Ford has sold about 20,000 MKC SUVs this year in the United States, compared with 258,000 Escape SUVs. Ford said last month it would suspend production of the Escape and MKC at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky for two weeks because of low demand.  In 2015, it told workers at the plant that it planned to phase out MKC production by 2019 and move it elsewhere.     The U.S. No. 2 automaker is planning to move some small-car production south of the border. Ford has endured scathing criticism from Trump over its Mexican investments for nearly 18 months.  He has said at times incorrectly that Ford planned to fire American workers because of its Mexican investments. During his presidential campaign, the Republican candidate also said that if elected he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on any Ford vehicles made there. A Trump spokeswoman did not immediately respond to questions about whether Fords decision to keep production of an SUV in the United States would cause him to drop plans to impose tariffs on some Ford vehicles built in Mexico. In April 2015, Ford said it planned to invest $2.5 billion to build two new plants in Mexico, adding 3,800 jobs in all. Earlier this year, Ford said it will invest a further $1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018. In September, Ford confirmed that all of the companys small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico by 2019, but no plants would be closed as a result.  Ford has repeatedly said no U.S. jobs will be lost because of the move - and it will produce two new vehicles at a Detroit area plant that built the small cars. In October, Bill Ford said he had met with Trump to talk about his extensive attacks on Fords investments in Mexico. Ford said Trumps criticism was infuriating and frustrating because of the companys extensive investments and employment in the United States. ",politicsNews,"November 18, 2016 ",1
Case on Trump worker contract raises conflict of interest question,"(Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has often boasted about the strict confidentiality pledges he exacts from his employees.  Now a legal challenge to one of those agreements is pending before a U.S. agency over which he will soon have influence, potentially posing an early test of concerns about conflicts of interest between Trumps public role and his business empire. In September, a worker-advocacy group filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) claiming a nondisclosure contract used by Trump is unlawfully broad. The contract prohibits employees, independent contractors and even volunteers from ever disclosing any information that Trump deems confidential about his personal, business or political life. The NLRB has said that sweeping or unclear contracts inhibit workers from discussing working conditions or speaking to union organizers.  The five-member NLRB currently has two vacancies that Trump is slated to fill early in his term, likely tipping what has been a liberal-leaning agency under President Barack Obama to a more business-friendly posture. If the NLRB rules against Trump, it could free up workers to be more vocal about their concerns and strengthen their bargaining power. In addition to the confidentiality case, there are about 10 other Trump-related cases pending at the NLRB. The cases involve alleged labor violations at the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, where management has refused to bargain with the Culinary Workers Union. It was not clear if the confidentiality contract was intended for workers on Trumps election campaign or employees in his businesses, and Reuters could not independently verify its authenticity. Representatives of the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. The case is at a very early stage and could be settled or dismissed before reaching a full hearing before the five-member NLRB. The boards decisions may be appealed in a federal court. The NLRB is comprised of three members from the sitting presidents party and two from the opposing party, a system that typically results in wide policy shifts between administrations. In addition to the current two vacancies, another will arise when a current members term expires next December.  Under the Obama administration, the NLRB has struck down  confidentiality agreements and other employment contracts that could discourage workers from organizing at T-Mobile USA Inc, Quicken Loans, DirectTV and a number of other companies.  Government ethics experts and labor lawyers said that if Trumps handpicked NLRB members uphold the contract, it could suggest favoritism.  There is an appearance of bias and political pressure that could undermine the legitimacy of the agency, said Richard Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School who was the chief White House ethics lawyer under Republican President George W. Bush. The NLRB cases represent one of several areas where concerns may arise over potential conflicts of interest raised by Trumps new role and his sprawling business interests. Trump last week said he would allow his children to run his businesses while maintaining his ownership interest via a blind trust. If the current cases are ruled upon by the NLRB, one possible solution to the potential conflict could be for Trump appointees to recuse themselves from cases involving his business organization, said a former NLRB chairman, William Gould.  Gould said that during his tenure at the agency, in the mid-1990s, members recused themselves from cases that raised any chance of a conflict. Gould, who is now a professor at Stanford Law School, said he disqualified himself from cases involving a union of which his son was a member. Several experts, however, said recusal would not be legally required unless Trumps appointees represented him or his companies in the past or were otherwise involved in his business. The challenge to Trumps confidentiality agreement was filed by David Rosenfeld, a California labor lawyer, on behalf of the Committee to Preserve the Religious Right to Organize, a worker advocacy group that he created.  Reuters reviewed a copy of the employment agreement that Rosenfeld filed with his complaint, which targeted both the Trump Organization and the Trump campaign. Rosenfeld said he copied it from the campaign website, but that the agreement was no longer posted there.  It was not clear how many employees signed this version of the agreement, and Reuters was unable to find a copy on the website. The agreement prohibits disclosure of details about Trumps personal life, political affairs and/or business affairs, as well as anything Mr. Trump insists remain private or confidential. It forbids employees from publicly disparaging Trump and his wife, children, grandchildren, siblings and other relatives. Confidentiality agreements are common, but labor law experts said they can be unlawful if they are too broad or dont specify what types of information will be deemed confidential.  Trump defended a similar confidentiality agreement in a case earlier this year involving a former campaign aide, whom Trump accused of giving information about other staffers to reporters. In a statement, the Trump campaign said confidentiality agreements were standard practice for entities that need to safeguard sensitive information. The case settled for undisclosed terms.

Congress could undo Obama-era student loan relief,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress could as soon as January start to dismantle President Barack Obamas transformation of student loan rules by blocking freshly minted regulations designed to help students who say they were defrauded by for-profit colleges. The new measures, which lay out loan relief procedures for the students, were issued by the Department of Education just days before the election. That is recent enough to allow the new Republican-led Congress to disapprove them under a 1996 law called the Congressional Review Act. It gives Congress 60 legislative days to reverse regulations with a simple vote. Republicans opposed the rule when it was proposed. Lamar Alexander, who chairs the Senate committee on education, is considering introducing a resolution that would overturn the so-called Borrower Defense rule, according to a spokeswoman.  Even without a legislative reversal, president-elect Donald Trump, who ran on an anti-regulation platform and started his own for-profit school, could instruct agencies to be more restrictive in how they interpret this rule and others aimed at easing student loan burdens. Students who attended the now-defunct Trump University did not qualify for federal loans and are not eligible for loan relief. Trump is facing civil lawsuits alleging fraud related to the school. After he was elected president, the stocks of for-profit education companies rose. The borrower defense rule was inspired by the meltdown of Corinthian Colleges Inc. in 2015, according to Rohit Chopra, who worked on the Corinthian case at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and later moved to the Department of Education as a special adviser. In recent months, ITT Tech. Inc. has also folded, leaving students adrift. By law, students at struggling technical and professional colleges are already allowed relief on federal loans, but the new rule creates a path for getting that relief. Students can make a fraud claim to the Education Department and then apply for a refund of federal money they borrowed and then paid to the school. It is the payment on a fraud complaint - sometimes made in the absence of any actual conviction - that rankles Republicans. They also dislike that the rule leaves students free to file class action suits against the schools, instead of arbitrating all disputes, said Neal McCluskey, who follows higher education at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.  It is not clear how many students - or how much in loans - would be affected by the new rule. The Education Department says it has already approved $250 million in relief to more than 15,000 applications from students who borrowed to attend Corinthian. The projected 10-year federal government expenses associated with the rules total $16 billion.  Congressional disapproval resolutions have failed in the past, because Obama vetoed them. But in 2017, anti-regulation Republicans will control the House, the Senate and the White House, and it takes only a simple majority of both chambers to reverse a rule.  Education Secretary John King defends the rule, saying his department went through a very thorough rule-making process and addressed thousands of comments in the final version of the regulations. The fact remains that students need some sort of process for student loan discharge in the case of a school closure or fraud, said Justin Draeger, president of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. Im not sure its as easy as simply voiding the entire regulation. There are other higher education reforms a Trump administration might undo, said Elizabeth Baylor, director for post-secondary education at left-leaning Center for American Progress. Many borrower programs instituted under Obama are at the education secretarys discretion, and Trump could appoint someone stricter on granting relief. A new secretary could also simply discontinue programs, she said.  In the same vein, Steve Gunderson, president of Career Education Colleges and Universities, says Congress could block the new rule without a resolution, either through an upcoming budget bill or education legislation.

Ohio congressman Ryan challenges Pelosi for House Democratic leader,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio said on Thursday he was challenging House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who has led the party in the chamber for 14 years, as Democrats question their strategy and leadership after a stinging general election defeat. Ryan, 43, who has been in Congress since 2003, said in a statement that Democrats had only been in the House of Representatives majority for four of the past 18 years, and last weeks election results set us back even further.  Vote for me and I will dedicate all of my energy to lead us back into the majority, said Ryan, who is from an old working-class, steel area of northeastern Ohio, the type of region the Democrats want to wrest back from Republicans. At this time of fear and disillusionment, we owe it to our constituencies to listen and bring a new voice into leadership.   Democrats had expected to do much better in the Nov. 8 election, when Republican Donald Trump, a New York businessman with no experience in public office, won the White House on the back of working-class voters.  Republicans kept their majorities in both Senate and House after some Democrats had predicted double-digit wins in the House and a chance to win the Senate.  Ryan announced his long-shot challenge after several days of publicly weighing it. Pelosi, 76, of California, claims she has support of two-thirds of Democrats before they vote Nov. 30. Im respectful what people are saying. Theres a lot of unease, Pelosi said when asked about the potential challenge. And as members in there said, we cannot be taking in the full responsibility for what happened in the election ... a lot of it was beyond our control, she added. A senior House Democratic aide called Ryans bid a publicity stunt. He said Ryan had shortchanged party coffers, paying only half of his dues owed since 2014 to the partys campaign committee. Ryans office declined comment. At a closed-door meeting of House Democrats Thursday, about half the roughly two dozen lawmakers who spoke said we need new leadership, Representative John Yarmuth of Louisville, Kentucky, said in an interview. He declined to say who he would support. Representative Emanuel Cleaver II of Kansas City, Missouri, was also noncommittal but said the caucus should take his (Ryans) candidacy seriously and contemplate where the caucus is, and where it could go under his leadership.

U.S. spy chief to resign as Trump takes office,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Director of National Intelligence James Clapper announced his resignation on Thursday and said it felt pretty good to step down, ending a six-year tenure as the top U.S. spy that included a sometimes rocky relationship with Congress. Clapper, 75, a retired three-star U.S. Air Force general, will stay on until Democratic President Barack Obama leaves office in January. He has said for months he intended to leave when Obama departed and his replacement will be chosen by Republican President-elect Donald Trump. Clappers term was marked by efforts to grapple with the re-emergence of an aggressive Russia, extremist attacks and growing cyber threats, as well as misleading a Senate committee about federal policy on collecting data on millions of Americans. His formal letter of resignation was issued in response to a White House request that all Obama administration political appointees submit resignations effective at noon on Jan. 20, a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said. Clapper appeared before the U.S. House of Representatives intelligence committee hearing on Thursday and Representative Adam Schiff, the committees top-ranking Democrat, lightheartedly said he hoped Clapper would stay in the job for four more years. I submitted my letter of resignation last night, which felt pretty good, Clapper responded. Ive got 64 days left. In March 2013 Clapper found himself at the center of controversy after testifying before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, telling Senator Ron Wyden that the U.S. government did not wittingly collect data on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans. His statement was disproved months later when former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden exposed classified details of U.S. surveillance programs, including one that collected domestic U.S. phone call data in bulk. Clapper later said his response to the Senate was the least untruthful one he could provide. On Thursday, Wyden said senior intelligence officials engaged in a deception spree regarding mass surveillance during Clappers tenure. Others praised Clapper with Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, saying he had served our country honorably and with distinction in every capacity requested of him. Before last weeks presidential election Clappers office issued a pre-election declaration accusing Russia of hacking U.S. political operatives and individuals as part of a scheme to interfere with the U.S. election process. On Thursday he declined to comment on whether the Russians had shared any of the hacked information with unnamed Americans in the past 18 months. Clapper said he did not expect a significant change in Russian behavior when asked about Russias alleged involvement in hacking. He added that Russia was planning to expand its presence at a naval base it maintains in Tartous, Syria.     The leading candidates to replace Clapper in the Trump administration include Robert Cardillo, director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and a previous deputy director of national intelligence under Clapper, according to national security officials and people close to Trumps transition team. Retired Lieutenant General Ronald Burgess, who headed the Defense Intelligence Agency during Obamas first term, and former Republican Representative Pete Hoekstra, who chaired the House Intelligence Committee, also may be in contention, sources said. The director of national intelligence oversees 17 U.S. intelligence agencies and serves as the presidents principal intelligence adviser and briefer. As deputy director of national intelligence, Cardillo had served as Obamas alternate principal briefer, an official said. Clappers service in military and intelligence spanned six decades, beginning in the 1960s in the U.S. Marine Corps followed by enlistment as a U.S. Air Force officer.

Trump Treasury candidate's bank accused of discrimination,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two California housing advocacy groups have alleged that a bank formerly controlled by Steven Mnuchin, a top candidate to be President-elect Donald Trumps Treasury secretary, engaged in discriminatory practices against black and Latino communities.  In a complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the groups are seeking an investigation of claims that OneWest Bank violated the Fair Housing Act through redlining practices such as failing to locate bank branches in black and Latino communities and extending very few or no mortgage loans to borrowers of color. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Hollywood film financier who is under consideration for the Treasury post, was not mentioned in the complaint, submitted on Wednesday by the California Reinvestment Coalition and Fair Housing Advocates of Northern California. But their allegations against a bank that was Southern Californias largest during Mnuchins ownership could fuel attacks from Senate Democrats if he is nominated to lead the Treasury, which is charged with safeguarding and regulating the U.S. financial system.  Mnuchin could not immediately be reached for comment through his office at Dune Capital Management, the New York-based hedge fund that he leads. Earlier on Thursday, he was seen entering Trump Tower in New York, where Trumps transition team is meeting.  The submission is the latest in the two housing groups long-running campaign against OneWest, which also included complaining about its foreclosure practices and opposing its sale by a Mnuchin-led investor group to CIT Group Inc for $3.4 billion last year. The complaint to HUD alleges that OneWest originated just two mortgages to African American customers in the banks assessment area. It also maintained and marketed bank-owned homes in predominantly white neighborhoods better than in neighborhoods of color. CIT said in a statement: CIT is committed to fair lending and works hard to meet the credit needs of all communities and neighborhoods we serve. Kevin Stein, deputy director of the California Reinvestment Coalition, insisted that the housing groups had long planned to file the complaint this week and the timing was not influenced by Mnuchins emergence as a candidate for Treasury. Mnuchin in 2009 led a group that acquired assets of failed mortgage lender IndyMac Bank for $1.55 billion from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, a deal that included a loss-sharing agreement on failed mortgages.  Rebranded as OneWest, it subsequently grew to have 73 branches and $23 billion in assets at the time the CIT deal was announced in 2014. ",politicsNews,"November 17, 2016 ",1

Merkel silent on fourth term despite glowing words from Obama,"BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama called German Chancellor Angela Merkel an outstanding ally on Thursday and said she might get his support if he were a German citizen and she decided to run for a fourth term as leader of Europes largest economy. Merkel, whom many expect to stand again, declined to show her hand, despite Obamas words of support. She said she would announce her decision at the appropriate moment, but that is not today.  Chancellor Merkel has been an outstanding partner, Obama told reporters in Berlin when asked if he wanted her to run again, praising her integrity and their shared core values.  Merkel told a joint news conference that it was difficult to say goodbye to Obama after their close partnership over the past eight years. The parting is hard for me, she said, before adding that the U.S. constitution limited a presidents time in office to a maximum of eight years and that she had to accept this. Obama smiled at journalists and winked. He said Merkel faced big burdens if she chose to run again. I wish I could be there to lighten her load somewhat, but she is tough. Merkel, in power since 2005, is expected to announce on Sunday whether she will run for chancellor again in next years federal election, the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland media group reported on Wednesday. Close Merkel aides have said she is moving toward another run, and one lawmaker in her conservative party this week told CNN that she would definitely put herself forward. A poll conducted for German broadcaster ARD, released on Thursday, showed Merkels conservatives would get 32 percent of the vote if the elections were held on Sunday, down one percentage point from a poll taken on Nov. 3. The center-left Social Democrats, junior partner in her  grand coalition, would get 23 percent, up one percentage point from the last poll, while the pro-environment Greens would get 13 percent, also up one point, the poll conducted by Infratest dimap showed. The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party dropped one percentage point to 12 percent.  ",politicsNews,"November 17, 2016 ",1
Trump 'unbelievably impressed' with Sen. Sessions: statement,"(Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump has been deeply impressed with U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions, his transition team said on Thursday of the longtime supporter who is under consideration for secretary of defense and attorney general. While nothing has been finalized and he is still talking with others as he forms his Cabinet, the president-elect has been unbelievably impressed with Senator Sessions and his phenomenal record as Alabamas Attorney General and U.S. Attorney, the team said in a statement.

Its wonderful to be back in Berlin. This is my sixth visit to Germany, it will not be my last, Obama told a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. I have somehow continued to miss Oktoberfest so thats probably something that is better for me to do as a former president rather than as president. Ill have more fun, he said. Around 7.5 million litres of beer are consumed each year at the Oktoberfest by locals and tourists alike, many decked out in traditional lederhosen and dirndls. ",politicsNews,"November 17, 2016 ",1

Obama says hopes Trump can stand up to Russia when needed,"BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday said he hoped President-elect Donald Trump could stand up to Russia when needed, and would take a constructive approach to cooperating with Moscow where interests aligned. In order for us to solve many big problems around the world, it is in our interest to work with Russia, Obama told a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. My hope is that the president-elect coming in takes a similarly constructive approach, finding areas where we can cooperate with Russia where our values and interests align, but that the president-elect also is willing to stand up to Russia when they are deviating from our values and international norms, Obama said. He added it was important for sanctions imposed against Russia over its actions in eastern Ukraine to remain in place until Moscow complied with the Minsk peace agreement. Obama, asked if he thought Merkel should run for a fourth term as chancellor, said he considered her an outstanding leader and would vote for Merkel, if he were a German citizen.

House Republicans pursue short-term government funding bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have decided to pursue a short-term measure to keep the government funded at current levels until March in order to give incoming President-elect Donald Trump more of a say on budget and appropriations issues, lawmakers said on Thursday. The decision, which surfaced as House Republicans prepared to meet Vice President-elect Mike Pence, calls for replacing a funding measure that expires on Dec. 9 with a similar resolution that would run through March 31. Lawmakers said the short-term measure would allow Trump to have greater input on setting funding priorities for the remainder of fiscal year 2017, which ends on Sept 30. I think the new, incoming government would like to have a say-so on how spending is allocated, House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters. And so we are working with ... the new Trump administration on the timing of that on the continuing resolution. Democrats and some Republicans described the decision as a mistake that could lead to a more difficult appropriations task next year. Representative Hal Rogers, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, expressed disappointment at the decision, which suspends months of work by lawmakers and their staffs on full-scale appropriations bills Congress had intended to enact before year end. I am extremely hopeful that the new Congress and the new administration will finish these bills, Rogers said in a statement, adding that his panel would immediately begin working on the new measure, known as a continuing resolution. Representative Charlie Dent, a Republican member of Rogers committee, called the decision a mistake following an election in which Democrats were able to increase their Senate minority.  It will be harder to pass an omnibus in March, Dent said. And well have a smaller margin in the senate to help us. Id rather clear the decks for a new administration. But apparently the new administration would like to be able to put their imprint on this. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said the continuing resolution would only perpetuate uncertainty about government funding.  Theyre making a big mistake for themselves. Theyre going to have a kettle of fish in March that they cant even imagine, she said. Some conservative House Republicans have sought a continuing resolution that would expire at the same time as the legislative limit on the government debt. ",politicsNews,"November 17, 2016 ",1
U.S. Mideast intelligence analysts felt superiors distorted findings,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Officials in the U.S. militarys Central Command, which oversees combat operations in the Middle East and South Asia, were much more likely than counterparts elsewhere to believe superiors  distorted or suppressed their analyses, according to a government intelligence survey.     Results of the December 2015 survey are likely to reinforce questions in Congress and elsewhere about whether the administration is pressuring officials to make over-optimistic claims about progress against Islamic State and the Taliban to help U.S. President Barack Obama leave office in January on a high note.     The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)     survey, which had not been reported until now, was one of the main topics of a House intelligence committee hearing on Thursday.     In one of its more striking findings, only 36 percent of  Central Command officials surveyed said they were confident that their mid- and senior-level managers were not deliberately distorting or suppressing their analyses. The average for the other eight U.S. military commands, which include those in the Pacific, Africa and Europe, was 72 percent. Central Command directs the American military missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and South Asia. Its analysts typically assess intelligence such as potential targets for bombing and an enemys strength. Asked if anyone attempted to distort or suppress analysis on which you were working in the face of persuasive evidence, 40 percent of the CENTCOM respondents said yes, compared to an average of 13 percent. The survey found that when that question was asked, 65 percent of the commands respondents said politicization was an issue.  The data suggests respondents from Central Command believe their workplace adheres to objectivity standards relatively less than do workplaces of their IC counterparts, the report said, using an acronym for the U.S. intelligence community.  Outgoing Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said the situation at Central Command had improved in the 2016 survey. Clapper told a congressional intelligence hearing on Thursday that CENTCOM objectivity numbers were now similar to those in other combatant commands. I do think there is, by virtue of the change in commanders and...(there) has been a change in the atmosphere there and so Ive been encouraged by the trends particularly this year, Clapper said.  CENTCOM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Separately, Clapper told the hearing that he had submitted his letter of resignation but would stay until the end of the Obama administration. The survey has been conducted annually since 2006 and about 4,000 analysts and managers responded to it, including 125 CENTCOM analysts and managers. It cautions, however, that because responses were voluntary, care should be taken when broadly interpreting results for each command.         Officials in other U.S. intelligence agencies said the Central Command issues were not the product of pressure from White House or other senior officials, and played a minor role in the administrations public claims of progress against Islamic State and the Taliban, many of which have proved to be overly optimistic. That is true, these officials said, because much of the Central Command analysis consists of daily bomb damage assessments and other situation reports, not strategic intelligence, and constitutes only a small part of the material that finds its way from numerous other intelligence agencies, including the CIA and the National Security Agency, into the Presidents daily intelligence briefing. Nevertheless, the findings of the survey, which was posted with no notice last month on a remote part of the ODNI website, are likely to raise questions about intelligence assessments provided by Central Command. Earlier this year, a U.S. congressional report said Central Command painted too rosy a picture of the fight against Islamic State in 2014 and 2015 compared with the reality on the ground and grimmer assessments by other analysts.       The Defense Department Inspector General is investigating the findings and is expected to issue a separate report, military officials said.     ",politicsNews,"November 17, 2016 ",1
Sanders to build base outside of Washington in new Democratic post,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Bernie Sanders, a former Democratic presidential candidate, said on Thursday he will help rebuild party support outside of Washington and craft a new economic message for all Americans. Sanders, who will become outreach chair on the Senate Democrats leadership team, will try to engage Americans who feel disconnected from the political process. Sanders is an Independent from Vermont but tends to vote with Democrats.    The real action to transform America wont take place on Capitol Hill, it will be in the grassroots America among millions struggling economically and young people, Sanders said at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. Democrat Charles Schumer of New York, elected the Senates new minority leader on Wednesday, said Sanders will join his 10-member leadership team. He wants to harness Sanders popularity with young and working class voters during the hard-fought primary battle with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Democrats are regrouping after the upset victory of Republican Donald Trump and after Republicans gained control of the Senate and House and made big gains in control of state legislatures. Sanders, who will also become the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, said he will make sure the panel represents the needs of working families, not billionaires. One problem for the Democrats is while they make the point that the economy is better off today than it was eight years ago, it has not improved for the middle class for decades, he said. What the Democrats I think too often have ignored is that for the last forty years ... the middle class of this country has been shrinking, Sanders told the breakfast, saying that real wages have gone down while income inequality has risen.     Sanders said he supports fresh leadership for the Democratic National Committee, the partys organization and has endorsed Congressman Keith Ellison, of Minnesota, as the new leader of the party. Ellison, who is a progressive and a Muslim, reflects the diversity of the party, Sanders and other Democrats say.  Sanders also said that Hillary Clinton should play a key role. After her defeat last week, Sanders said he did not talk to her directly, only on a conference call. She ended up getting more votes that Mr. Trump and it goes without saying that she has a very important role to play about the future of the Democratic party, he said.

Confusion over Trump's first talks with foreign leader,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One day before U.S. President-elect Donald Trumps first meeting with a foreign leader, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japanese officials said they had not finalized when or where in New York it would take place, who would be invited, or in some cases whom to call for answers. Uncertainty over the talks shows the difficulties in turning Trump from a freewheeling businessman into a sitting president with a watertight schedule and a fully functioning administration by his inauguration on Jan. 20.               Japanese and U.S. officials said on Wednesday the State Department had not been involved in planning the meeting, leaving the logistical and protocol details that normally would be settled far in advance still to be determined. There has been a lot of confusion, said one Japanese official.  The meeting was only agreed to last week and Trump and his advisers have been busy in meetings at his headquarters in Manhattans Trump Tower in recent days to work out who gets which job in the new administration.  While world leaders sometimes hold loosely planned bilateral meetings at regional summits, it is unusual for foreign leaders to hold high-level diplomatic talks in the United States without detailed planning. Abe is on his way to an Asia-Pacific summit in Peru. State Department spokesman John Kirby said that to his knowledge, Trumps transition team had not been in contact with the department either to discuss the transition of government or to seek information ahead of his meetings with foreign leaders. Trump is expected to use the Abe meeting to reassure Japan and other Asian allies rattled by his campaign rhetoric, advisers to Trump said.  But Trump, a brash outsider with no diplomatic or government experience, and Abe, a veteran lawmaker, have differences on policy issues such as free trade.     Several Trump aides did not immediately answer requests on Wednesday for comment about the Abe visit or contact between the transition team and the State Department.    Speculation about top appointments to the Trump administration has intensified since the head of the team overseeing the transition, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, was removed last week and replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Transition team officials said on Wednesday night that Trump planned to announce landing teams on Thursday that would begin setting up staff in key agencies, like the State and Justice departments. They added in a conference call with reporters that those who begin working on the teams would have to sign an agreement not to lobby for five years after they leave the administration, keeping with a Trump campaign promise to institute a ban on lobbying for executive branch employees.  Trump on Wednesday denounced reports of disorganization in the team, singling out the New York Times for saying world leaders have had trouble getting in touch with him since his upset victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election.     The Republican real estate magnate said on Twitter he had taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan.  The Times, a frequent target of Trumps Twitter blasts, said on Tuesday that U.S. allies were scrambling to figure out how and when to contact Mr. Trump and blindly dialing in to Trump Tower to try to reach him. The newspaper said Trump was working without official State Department briefing materials in his dealings with foreign leaders.         The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition, Trump tweeted, without specifying what it was in the article that was incorrect. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders.     Trump and Pence had spoken to 29 foreign leaders, the transition team said on Wednesday. Trump has mostly stuck to normal practice for a U.S. president-elect with the order in which he has spoken to foreign leaders on the phone since his election victory. But some of his contacts have stretched the limits of the usual procedure.      Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, an army general who seized power three years ago, appears to have been the first leader to speak to Trump after the election, ahead of closer allies like the leaders of Britain and Germany. Sisis office called Trump last Wednesday and the incoming U.S. president told him it was the first international call he had received to congratulate him on winning the election.  Australian media reported that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was the second leader Trump spoke to, after the Australian ambassador to the United States got Trumps personal phone number from Australian golfer and Trump friend Greg Norman.  Trump also talked on the phone to the leaders of Britain, Germany, Turkey and other allies.   But a phone call on Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which the two men agreed to aim for constructive cooperation, raised eyebrows among Democrats and traditionalist Republicans worried about a resurgent Moscow. Trump also met Britains anti-EU Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage at Trump Tower last weekend, ahead of any meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May. State Department spokesman Kirby said: Theres been no outreach to date from Trumps transition aides. But its not for us to approve or disapprove of conversations that the president-elect is having or may have in the future with foreign leaders. Despite fevered speculation, Trump has yet to say who will fill Cabinet positions such as secretary of state, treasury secretary or defense secretary. His team said that was not unusual and was in line with the timing of the transition of Democrat Barack Obama to the White House after he won the presidency in 2008.  Trump could add son-in-law Jared Kushner as a top White House adviser, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, has been a central adviser during the campaign and transition. The Trump transition team has repeatedly denied it is seeking high-level security clearance for Kushner. A federal anti-nepotism law prohibits a president from hiring family members to serve in his administration, but the Journal said it was not clear if the law applied to a position inside the White House. It added Kushner had indicated he would avoid the issue by not taking pay for any White House work.       Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump aide who served as his campaign manager, said she did not think Kushner was seeking an official role in the White House. I just hung up the phone with Jared, and we didnt discuss that, Conway told reporters on Wednesday night. I think he just wants to be incredibly helpful to his father-in-law as hes been all along. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley will meet with Trump on Thursday, the transition team said. She emerged on Wednesday as a potential candidate for secretary of state. After speculation emerged that JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon remained a contender for treasury secretary, the banks stock price dropped. ",politicsNews,"November 16, 2016 ",1

Clinton urges renewed 'fight for values',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Defeated Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called on Wednesday for a renewed fight for a more-inclusive United States despite disappointment over an election loss that laid bare national divisions. In her first public remarks since conceding to Republican Donald Trump last week, Clinton said that many Americans were asking whether his victory meant the United States was still the country they thought it was. The divisions laid bare by this election run deep, but please listen to me when I say this. America is worth it, our children are worth it, she said at a Children Defense Fund event honoring scholarship winners. Believe in our country, fight for our values and never, ever give up. Although Fund founder Marian Wright Edelman called the nonprofit advocacy groups event a love-in for Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former first lady said it had not been easy for her to attend. There have been times this past week when all I wanted to do was just to curl up with a good book or our dogs, and never leave the house again, said Clinton, whose ties to the Children Defense Fund date back to her work there as a young law student. Clinton, a former secretary of state, won the popular vote but lost the crucial electoral college tally to Trump, a New York real estate magnate who has taken a hard line on immigration and has opposed accepting Syrian refugees. I know many of you are deeply disappointed by the results of the election. I am too, more than I can ever express, Clinton said. But as I said last week, our campaign was never about one person or even one election. It was about the country we love, and building an America that is hopeful, inclusive and big hearted. She said that help for children backed by Republicans and Democrats was a hopeful sign of both parties working together. The federal Childrens Health Insurance Program, for example, now covers 8 million children and its creation had relied on bipartisan support, Clinton said. For the sake of our children, and our families and our country, I ask you to stay engaged, stay engaged on every level, Clinton said. She added, I am as sure of this as anything I have ever known. America is still the greatest country in the world, it is still the place where anyone can beat the odds. ",politicsNews,"November 17, 2016 ",1

U.S. panel urges ban on China state firms buying U.S. companies,"WASHINGTON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers should take action to ban Chinas state-owned firms from acquiring U.S. companies, a congressional panel charged with monitoring security and trade links between Washington and Beijing said on Wednesday. In its annual report to Congress, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission said the Chinese Communist Party has used state-backed enterprises as the primary economic tool to advance and achieve its national security objectives. The report recommended Congress prohibit U.S. acquisitions by such entities by changing the mandate of CFIUS, the U.S. government body that conducts security reviews of proposed acquisitions by foreign firms. The Commission recommends Congress amend the statute authorizing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to bar Chinese state-owned enterprises from acquiring or otherwise gaining effective control of U.S. companies, the report said. CFIUS, led by the U.S. Treasury and with representatives from eight other agencies, including the departments of Defense, State and Homeland Security, now has veto power over acquisitions from foreign private and state-controlled firms if it finds that a deal would threaten U.S. national security or critical infrastructure. If enacted, the panels recommendation would essentially create a blanket ban on U.S. purchases by Chinese state-owned enterprises. The report has again revealed the commissions stereotypes and prejudices, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in Beijing.  We ask that Chinese companies investing abroad abide by local laws and regulations, and we hope that relevant countries will create a level playing field, he told a daily news briefing. The panels report is purely advisory, but could carry extra weight this year because they come as President-elect Donald Trumps transition team is formulating its trade and foreign policy agenda and vetting candidates for key economic and security positions. Congress also could be more receptive, after U.S. voter sentiment against job losses to China and Mexico helped Republicans retain control of both the House and the Senate in last weeks election. Trump strongly criticized China throughout the U.S. election campaign, grabbing headlines with his pledges to slap 45 percent tariffs on imported Chinese goods and to label the country a currency manipulator on his first day in office. Chinese state owned enterprises are arms of the Chinese state, Dennis Shea, chairman of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, told a news conference. We dont want the U.S. government purchasing companies in the United States, why would we want the Chinese Communist government purchasing companies in the United States? The recommendation to change laws governing CFIUS was one of 20 proposals the panel made to Congress. On the military side, it called for a government investigation into how far outsourcing to China has weakened the U.S. defense industry. The 16-year-old panel also said Congress should pass legislation that would require its pre-approval of any move by the U.S. Commerce Department to declare China a market economy and limit anti-dumping tariffs against the country. The United States and U.S. businesses attracted a record $64.5 billion worth of deals involving buyers from mainland China this year, more than any other country targeted by Chinese buyers, according to Thomson Reuters data.  The push into the United States is part of a global overseas buying spree by Chinese companies that this year has seen a record $200 billion worth of deals, nearly double last years tally.  CFIUS has shown a higher degree of activism against Chinese buyers this year, catching some by surprise. Prominent deals that fell victim to CFIUS include Tsinghua Holdings $3.8 billion investment in Western Digital (WDC.O).     Overall, data do not demonstrate CFIUS has been a significant obstacle for Chinese investment in the United States. In 2014, the latest year for which data is available, China topped the list of foreign countries in CFIUS review with 24 deals reviewed out of more than 100 scrutinized by CFIUS. Although the number of Chinese transactions reviewed rose in absolute terms, it fell as a share of overall Chinese acquisitions, the report noted, and the vast majority of deals reviewed by CFIUS were cleared.

China's interference in Hong Kong reaching alarming levels: U.S. congressional panel,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional panel has warned of an alarming rise in Chinas interference in Hong Kong, noting fears over the former British colonys continued role as a global financial hub. In its annual report to Congress on Wednesday, the bipartisan U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission highlights the chilling abduction and detention of five booksellers based in Hong Kong as well as pressure on media and academic freedoms. Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 under a one country, two systems agreement that ensures its freedoms, independent legal system and wide-ranging autonomy remain intact. The commission, in a detailed 33-page section, urges a fresh probe from the State Department into Hong Kongs autonomy and freedoms, as well as continued congressional oversight. Hong Kongs traditional standing as a global financial hub has significant economic implications for the United States, as U.S. trade and investment ties with Hong Kong are substantial, the report notes. It says the booksellers detentions - including two foreign nationals and one who was abducted inside Hong Kong - broadened domestic fears of mainland encroachment and sparked a record turnout in Septembers legislative election. This incident has threatened the maintenance of the one country, two systems framework and led some observers to question Hong Kongs status as a leading global financial hub, the report warns. The election took place against the backdrop of an alarming rise in mainland interference in Hong Kong. U.S. senators Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton also introduced a bill that would freeze U.S.-based assets and ban U.S. entry of those responsible for the surveillance, abduction, detention, or forced confessions of certain booksellers and journalists in Hong Kong, according to a statement on Rubios senate website. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Hong Kong was an internal matter for China and no foreign country had the right to interfere. In order to try to split the country, some forces have openly sought foreign support, Geng told a daily news briefing. Those who attempt to use foreign forces to achieve their own political goals will not succeed. The report comes amid deepening concerns in Beijing over a fledgling independence movement in the city. The High Court this week backed a government demand to bar two recently elected lawmakers, who insulted China when taking their oath of office, from the legislature. In a statement after the reports release, the Hong Kong government said the one country, two systems principle was being implemented successfully, as was the citys role as a global commercial hub. It also urged foreign parties not to interfere. The booksellers were involved in the production and sale of gossipy political titles banned in mainland China but freely available in Hong Kong. Their plight fueled Western governments concerns and sparked formal diplomatic protests. One of the five men, Swedish passport holder Gui Minhai, who disappeared from the Thai resort of Pattaya last October, is the only one still in detention in China. Another, Lam Wing-kee, returned to Hong Kong in June, saying he had been held captive by Chinese agents for eight months.  The report places the worsening climate in the city in the context of Chinas broader disregard for international legal agreements and norms on issues such as the South China Sea and Taiwan.

Key U.S. senator remains concerned over ChemChina-Syngenta deal,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A powerful U.S. senator said he is concerned that state-owned ChemChina, which is buying Swiss crop protection and seed group Syngenta SYNN.S for $43 billion, could use U.S. sovereign immunity laws to shield itself from claims in U.S. courts. Some Chinese state-owned entities have argued that they have sovereign immunity and thus cant be sued in U.S. courts under the U.S. Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) of 1976. The acquisition by China National Chemical Corp (ChemChina) [CNNCC.UL] of Syngenta, the largest global investment by a Chinese company, won U.S. regulatory clearance in August despite concerns from some lawmakers over U.S. food security. This week, a U.S. congressional panel urged lawmakers to take action to ban Chinese state-owned firms from acquiring U.S. companies. In a Nov. 9 letter to U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley that was posted on his website, ChemChina said its U.S.-incorporated businesses are subject to U.S. civil law, and that FSIA does not apply to commercial activity.  Grassley, who represents the U.S. agricultural powerhouse state of Iowa, said in a Nov. 16 response that he remained concerned that ChemChina could seek to shield itself from U.S. court jurisdiction.  While ChemChina indicated that immunity would not extend to Syngentas U.S. business, the company failed to note that immunity would otherwise apply to a wholly state-owned entity, he said on his website.  Some legal experts say the sovereign immunity defense, intended under international law to shield governments from legal rulings made by a foreign power, typically does not apply to commercial cases. ChemChinas acquisition is now in the process of gaining approval from the European Commission, and the deal is expected to be closed around the end of March. In its letter to Grassley, ChemChina said the Chinese government does not interfere with ChemChinas operations and has not directed ChemChina or any of its affiliates to engage in price-fixing with competitors.  Syngenta will continue to have its same strategy, management, people and culture and its headquarters in Basel. No jobs will be lost and no jobs will go overseas as a result of this transaction, it said. ChemChina also said the Chinese government does not interfere with its operations and has not directed ChemChina or any of its affiliates to engage in price fixing with competitors.

China sees THAAD deployment as 'weather vane' under Trump,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Whether President-elect Donald Trump goes through with a deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system in South Korea will be a key indicator to how political ties unfold with China, sources with ties to the leadership in Beijing said. Beijing will also be keeping a close eye on Trumps meeting on Thursday with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, its key regional rival, for clues on how the President-elect, who has never held public office, is likely to conduct foreign policy, they said. South Korea and the United States have agreed to deploy a Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) anti-missile system  to counter missile threats from North Korea. It is expected to be in place within eight to 10 months, the commander of U.S. forces in South Korea said earlier this month. China has argued the planned deployment undermines strategic stability in Northeast Asia, and worries that THAADs powerful radar provides coverage of Chinas missile installations. Whether deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense is delayed is a political weather vane, one source said. A security adviser to Trump said last week his meeting in New York with Abe on Thursday may mark the start of talks to garner Tokyos support for a push-back against Chinas growing influence in Asia. We have heard what he said. We will now watch what he does, said the source, requesting anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to media. We will play it by ear, the source said, invoking an idiom that translates to blocking a punch or a kick as it comes. Trump has created doubts over his commitment to security alliances with Japan and South Korea, suggesting they need to pay more for a U.S. military presence and even hinting they should develop their own nuclear weapons capability. Japan going nuclear would be Chinas worst nightmare and is likely to provoke strong reaction, diplomats and analysts have said. Chinas relations with Japan have long been poisoned by what Beijing sees as Tokyos failure to fully atone for its invasion and occupation of parts of China before and during World War Two as well as competing claims over a group of East China Sea islets. Northeast Asia would be a powder keg, a second source said, referring to a nuclearized sub-region including China, Japan, North and South Korea. The State Council Information Office, or cabinet spokesmans office, had no immediate comment. China is generally opposed to military alliances, seeing them as Cold War relics.  Chinas stability-obsessed leaders do not know what to make of the 70-year-old Trump, whose win over Hillary Clinton was unexpected, and has backpedaled on some of his more controversial campaign statements. For example, Trump pledged his commitment to defending South Korea under an existing security alliance during a phone call last week with South Korean President Park Geun-hye. Trump had said during the election campaign he would be willing to withdraw the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea unless Seoul paid a greater share of the cost of the U.S. deployment. Trump told Reuters in an interview in May he was willing to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyangs nuclear program - a major shift in U.S. policy toward the isolated nation - but has also called for China to do more to rein in Pyongyang. Sino-U.S. relations after Trump takes office on Jan. 20 are expected to be fluid, although Chinese President Xi Jinping told Trump during a telephone call on Monday cooperation was the only correct choice for the two giants. A statement from Trumps presidential transition office said the two men established a clear sense of mutual respect for one another and he believes the two countries will have one of the strongest relationships moving forward. Trumps election does offer some good news for China: it signals the demise of the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which excludes China; it raises the possibility of belated U.S. backing for the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and possibly marks an end to President Obamas strategic pivot to Asia. The bad news is that Trump has often made provocative remarks about China during his campaign, including threats to slap 45 percent tariffs on imports from China and label the worlds second-biggest economy a currency manipulator. Wei Jianguo, a retired vice commerce minister, was optimistic a trade war could be avoided. Protectionism is on the rise, but a trade war between China and the United States is unlikely, Wei, vice chairman of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, a government-backed think-tank, told Reuters. That was just election rhetoric, he said. ",politicsNews,"November 17, 2016 ",1
Trump's golf buddy Norman pitches Australia to lead diplomatic line,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull became one of the first world leaders to speak to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump this week, but only after one of Trumps old golfing buddies was asked to chip in. Turnbull confirmed that Australian golfing great and former world number one Greg Norman had been tapped to help facilitate the introduction to Trump, who includes building golf courses among his many business interests. The connection enabled Turnbull to jump the line of world leaders waiting to get the new U.S. leader on the phone, well ahead of larger allies like Britain and Japan, after Trumps surprise win in last weeks presidential election. Indiplomacy and policies, you use lotsof networks. All I can say is wehave great networks, greatconnections and Greg Norman is agreat Australian, Turnbull said on Thursday. (Norman) isa great advocate for strengtheningthe Australian-American alliance.One of our greatest assets is the more than million Australians who live overseas, he told reporters in Sydney. Australias unconventional diplomatic approach reflects the apparent confusion that surrounds the incoming Trump administration as it  works on the transition before he is sworn in as president on Jan. 20.  Norman, a U.S. resident, described Republican Trump as a friend and said he was happy to help. Donald, for all his bluster, rhetoric and aggressive style of messaging, caught the attention of those that needed a rudder for their forgotten ship and beliefs, Norman said in a statement. Like it or not, he made a poignant and powerful impact on a base that sat sadly alienated, he said. Damon Hunt, a spokesman for Turnbull, said Australia had already been using its network of expatriates in the United States to canvass both candidates well before Trump unexpectedly defeated Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Trumps contact information was handed on to Australias ambassador in the United States, Joe Hockey, who then relayed it to Turnbull, Hunt said. The only thing that was unusual about it was that we built relationships with both sides. A lot of countries and certain politicians just picked the Democrats, we were never going to back just one horse, Hunt said. ",politicsNews,"November 17, 2016 ",1
"China, U.S. must avoid excessive mutual suspicion: Chinese envoy","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China and the United States must avoid being overly suspicious of each others strategic intentions, Chinas ambassador to the United States said on Wednesday while looking ahead to the Presidency of Donald Trump. Trump lambasted China throughout the U.S. election campaign, drumming up headlines with his pledges to slap 45 percent tariffs on imported Chinese goods and to label the country a currency manipulator on his first day in office. He has also vowed to build up the U.S. Navy in what advisers say will be a strategy to reassure countries in the Asia-Pacific worried about Chinas assertive pursuit of territorial claims. Chinas Washington envoy, Cui Tiankai, told a film screening to commemorate the 1979 normalization of U.S.-China ties that after a most unusual political season, it was important to build consensus and identify common ground. He said both countries were already cooperating on many issues, but added: We have to make greater efforts to promote better mutual understanding and we should be careful not to be overly suspicious about each others strategic intentions. There are people here in the United States who believe that everything that China does is aimed at challenging the United States s global dominance, and there are people who believe that everything the U.S. is doing is aimed at containing China. I think both views are wrong. There would inevitably be problems and challenges in the next four years, Cui said, but ... I am quite confident that, on the whole, the relationship will move forward on a stable and right track. Cui said the countries had a shared responsibility to cooperate on issues such as terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We both want stability in the world. We both strive for a stronger global economy, and we both need a better natural environment. Common goals call for a close partnership.  Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone on Monday and Xi told the U.S. President-elect cooperation was the only choice for the worlds two largest economies, while Trump said they had established a clear sense of mutual respect. Nevertheless, Trumps election has created uncertainty when Beijing hopes for stability as it faces daunting reform challenges at home, slowing growth and a leadership reshuffle that will assemble a new party elite around Xi in late 2017.  Zbigniew Brzezinski, who as U.S. National Security Adviser drove normalization with China in the late 1970s told the same Washington event the world was watching U.S. political developments with some stupefaction. We are now living in a political system, a worldwide system, that is experiencing a very serious crisis... . (I)t is potentially threatening to both sides, to the well-being of global stability, he said. You can have serious political problems in China  there are serious problems in the United States. We dont know how we will be managing responsibilities in the foreseeable future, given some of the initial warning signals, Brzezinski said.

"Schumer, McConnell elected top leaders in Senate","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. senators elected Chuck Schumer of New York as minority leader on Wednesday, and he tapped former presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders to help Democrats woo blue-collar workers, many of whom voted for President-elect Donald Trump. Senate Republicans also met and voted to keep Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as the majority leader. Schumer, 65, replaces the retiring Harry Reid of Nevada as the top Democrat in the Senate as the party prepares to deal with Republican Trump and Republican majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives. Schumer said Democrats had learned from the Nov. 8 election that they needed a sharper, bolder economic message about returning the economic system which so many feel is rigged against them to one that works for the people. Were ready to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Republicans, working with soon-to-be-President Trump on issues where we agree, but we will go toe-to-toe against the president-elect whenever our values or the progress weve made is under assault, Schumer, who has been in the Senate since 1999, told reporters after the Democrats closed-door election. In a move recognizing the influence of Sanders with many working-class voters, Schumer asked the independent senator from Vermont to be caucus head of outreach. Sanders, who lost the presidential primary to former senator and secretary of state Hillary Clinton, said his job was to reach out to grassroots America. Another liberal, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was given the role of vice chair of the conference while yet another progressive voice, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, was made conference secretary. Senator Joe Manchin, a more conservative Democrat from West Virginia, was named vice chairman of the Democratic policy and communications committee.  Schumer said he knew there would be differences of opinion on the new team, but that together the group could speak to the blue-collar worker in West Virginia, and Michigan, as well as the people who live along the coast.  Trumps economic populism helped him flip some once-reliably Democratic areas in blue-collar states while Democrats did better in large urban centers and coastal states. Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois remained minority whip, the No. 2 spot, while Senator Patty Murray of Washington was chosen as assistant Democratic leader. In the House, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi announced she was running for minority leader again and said she already has the support of more than two-thirds of her caucus. Pelosi, who may face a challenger, agreed this week to delay leadership elections until Nov. 30 after her fellow Democrats called for more time to reassess why they fell short of their goals in the Nov. 8 election.

"Trump cyber security team, policy slow to take shape: officials","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trumps transition team has not announced a point person dedicated to cyber security policy or staffing in his administration, an omission that could make the United States more vulnerable to threats and worsen a government cyber talent shortfall, current and former national security officials said. They and multiple sources involved with the Trump transition organization said they were unaware of any person in the Trump orbit who is dealing specifically with cyber security, and that there has been minimal contact with federal agencies. The apparent lack of expertise or prioritization coincides with U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA, having   pivoted to digital warfare to address the growing national security and economic threats that nation-states and extremist groups pose in cyberspace. In response to a request for comment, a Trump spokeswoman referred to a cyber-security vision on Republican Trumps campaign website, which calls for an immediate review of U.S. cyber defenses and vulnerabilities and lists high-profile hacks as key issues without further explanation. It did not mention cyber attacks on Democratic Party political organizations during the election campaign that the U.S. government said were carried out by Russia to interfere with the Nov. 8 vote. Trump praised WikiLeaks for publishing leaked emails from his opponent Hillary Clintons campaign and also questioned whether Russia was responsible for the hacks. A former National Security Agency (NSA) official who reviewed the vision statement said it was short on detail. Kellyanne Conway, a senior advisor to Trump who managed his campaign, told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower Wednesday that reports of a rocky transition process were false. You dont form a federal government overnight, she said. The ousting of former Republican lawmaker Mike Rogers from Trumps transition team on Tuesday left a void of expertise on cyber and intelligence matters for the president-elect, officials said.   Rogers, who chaired the House Intelligence Committee while in Congress was talked about in Washington as a potential CIA Director or Director of National Intelligence. Former Defense Intelligence Agency Director Michael Flynn and retired lieutenant general Ronald Burgess are part of Trumps transition team. They were focused on intelligence and security matters, according to a Trump team document that has circulated among Washington trade and lobbying organizations in the week since the New York businessmans stunning election victory. Flynn is a contender to be the next Director of National Intelligence or White House National Security Adviser, according to people close to him and multiple media reports. A less likely possibility, according to the people, is Flynn would be named head of the National Security Agency. But neither Flynn nor Burgess are experts on cyber security, nor have they indicated an interest in the subject to Obama administration officials, sources close to the Trump and Obama teams said. The federal government has struggled for years to keep pace with the rising need for cyber talent.  A July memo from the White Houses Office of Management and Budget found a critical shortage of talent across the country was worsened in government, caused in part by an inability to compete with lucrative salaries in the private sector.  James Norton, a former George W. Bush administration official who helped set up the Department of Homeland Securitys first cyber security team, said that Trumps transition team may be waiting to move forward on the issue until after cabinet-level security posts are filled.  Cyber will be a priority, said Norton,now president of Washington-based consulting firm Play-Action Strategies LLC. Theres a little bit of fog, but I think that will clear once the names of the nominees are out.  But finding and retaining qualified technical people to serve in government may become even more difficult under a Trump presidency because of disagreements with his policies and politics, three former national security officials said.  The president-elects bombastic statements on the campaign trail frequently alarmed tech companies and at times elicited public mockery, such as when Trump called for closing off parts of the Internet to limit militant Islamist propaganda or urged his supporters to boycott Apple when it refused to help the FBI unlock an iPhone tied to one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters. Susan Hennessey, a former attorney in the office of the general counsel at the NSA, said she has been urging people in the intelligence community to keep working in Trumps administration because their expertise will be necessary to protect the country and resist potential abuses of executive power on issues such as surveillance. In candor, Im sad to be asking former colleagues whom I respect to consider setting aside their conscience in order to serve their country, said Hennessey, who now serves as managing editor of the national security blog Lawfare. I cant and dont blame anyone who feels they cant stay. A current national security official who has been approached by the Trump transition team said all or most political appointees in the Obama administration are expected to be sent packing after Trumps inauguration on Jan. 20. He predicted that as much as five to 10 percent of the federal workforce also might leave.  Richard Clarke, a former senior White House advisor on counterterrorism and cyber security in both the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, said Trumps election presents an opportunity to civil servants to help shape or resist the president-elects opinion on policy matters. He said many of the same concerns about Trump existed within the federal bureaucracy when former President Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980. These people like Reagan and Trump are not well-grounded in policy, Clarke said. They dont have a lot of firm beliefs that stem from years of analysis and experience, Clarke told Reuters. You can change their mind if you do it subtly, if they trust you. And you may not even know youve changed their mind, because they dont know what their mind is. Some parts of government are more effective than others at slow-rolling the presidents impulses, Clarke said. But you cant slow-roll work that needs to be done, such as improving cyber security and addressing cyber threats, he said. ",politicsNews,"November 16, 2016 ",1
U.S. Senate leader says Iran sanctions renewal will pass,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will vote to renew sanctions on Iran for 10 years before adjourning next month, the chambers Republican leader said on Wednesday, sending the bill to the White House, where President Barack Obama is expected to sign it into law. The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday for the decade-long extension of the Iran Sanctions Act, or ISA, first adopted in 1996 to punish investments in Irans energy industry and deter the countrys pursuit of nuclear weapons. The act will expire at the end of 2016 if it is not renewed. Were going to take up the House bill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters at the Senates weekly Republican leadership news conference. ... And were going to pass it. The Obama administration and other world powers reached an agreement last year in which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. But members of Congress said they wanted the ISA to stay in effect to send a strong message that the United States will respond to provocations by Iran and give any U.S. president the ability to quickly reinstate sanctions if Tehran violated the nuclear agreement. White House officials have said they did not think the reinstatement was needed, now that the nuclear agreement has been in effect for almost a year. But they also have not raised concerns that a renewal would violate the deal. Apart from the ISA, the nuclear agreements longer-term future became more uncertain when Republican Donald Trump was elected president on Nov. 8, and Republicans kept their majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives. Every Republican in Congress opposed the nuclear agreement. And Trump was harshly critical of it as he campaigned. ",politicsNews,"November 16, 2016 ",1
Congressional panel calls for U.S. women's history museum,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A congressionally-appointed panel on Wednesday called for the creation of a U.S. museum of womens history, with preferred sites on or near Washingtons National Mall. The American Museum of Womens History would close a gap in the U.S. capital, which has museums devoted to everything from space and spies to stamps and black history, but none focused on women, its backers said. America needs and deserves a physical national museum dedicated to showcasing the historical experiences and impact of women in this country, said the report from the seven-member commission - all women - empaneled by Congress in 2014. Creation of the museum would call for a decade-long effort to gather support and funding and to build it. The cost for a building of 75,000 square feet (6,900 square meters) to 90,000 square feet (8,400 square meters) would be estimated at $150 million to $180 million in private funds, the report said. The commission also recommended that Congress donate land free of charge for the museum site or provide an existing building. The museum would become part of the Smithsonian Institution, the worlds biggest museum complex, overseen by a board also appointed by Congress. The federal government would assume operation and maintenance costs. The panel recommended three sites for a womens museum on or around the National Mall, a vast area stretching two miles (3.2 km) from the U.S. Capitol west to the Lincoln Memorial and often called Americas front lawn. One site is on the side of the Mall opposite the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in September. The second site is the Smithsonians 19th-century Arts and Industries Building, also on the Mall, and the third is on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol. Congress declared the Mall closed to new building in 2003, but made an exception for the African American museum. With the Mall already crowded with monuments and museums, Washington planners are looking for ways to pay tribute to U.S. historical figures and events away from the area.

New York City mayor tells Trump about fear over his policies,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Wednesday he told Donald Trump during a private meeting that fear is gripping communities in Americas largest city over the U.S. president-elects vows to crack down on illegal immigrants. The Democratic mayor and the wealthy Republican New York real estate developer traded insults during the campaign, but met for about an hour inside Trumps skyscraper headquarters. Afterward, de Blasio said he expressed his concerns about Trumps policies toward immigrants, as well the need for tough Wall Street regulation and protecting the rights of racial and religious minorities. De Blasio, who supported fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton against Trump in last weeks election, said the two men had a candid and substantive discussion. De Blasio said he told Trump immigrant families should not be torn apart by deportations, and that the police tactic supported by Trump of stopping and searching people on the street can drive a wedge between minorities and law enforcement. New York historically has been a city filled with immigrants. According to census data, 37 percent of New York Citys 8.6 million residents are foreign-born, far above the national figure of 13 percent.  I tried to express to him how much fear there is - how much fear there is in communities all over this city, the mayor told reporters outside Trump Tower.  During the campaign, Trump called for the deportation of all of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally. Trump said in a TV interview aired on Sunday his priority was to remove up to 3 million immigrants who have criminal records or are gang members or drug dealers, and would decide on the others after the U.S. border is secured. The mayor last Thursday said New York would remain a sanctuary city shielding illegal immigrants, adding that we are not going to sacrifice a half million people who live among us, who are part of our community. Trump has said he may want to place some U.S. mosques under surveillance and suggested he may want to maintain a national database of Muslims. The New York Police Department has 900 officers who are Muslim, de Blasio said he told Trump.  The mayor declined to say what Trumps responses had been. I think they both said it was a very productive meeting, Trumps campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said separately, adding that the president-elect is open to speaking with a variety of people. Trump during the campaign called de Blasio the worst mayor in America and in New York Citys history. The mayor during the campaign called Trump dangerous and one of the worst demagogues in recent U.S. political history. Trump grew up in the New York City borough of Queens and still makes Manhattan his primary residence. Trump has not said whether he will continue to live part-time in New York after he takes office on Jan. 20. De Blasio said he spoke to Trump about the importance of tough banking regulations and of tax cuts that do not favor the wealthy. Trump has promised a dismantling of the Democratic-backed 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted following the financial crisis, and has promised deep tax cuts. The mayor expressed some optimism that Trump would follow through on a campaign pledge to spend more on infrastructure. Trump said during the campaign he would rebuild Americas infrastructure including highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools and hospitals. It would have a hugely positive impact on millions of New Yorkers, and hopefully put a lot of people back to work, de Blasio said. ",politicsNews,"November 16, 2016 ",1
"Ahead of Trump meeting, Abe told not to take campaign rhetoric literally","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will seek reassurances from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on U.S.-Japan ties on Thursday and a senior adviser to Abe said he had been told that campaign remarks calling the alliance into question should not be taken literally. Abe is due to meet Trump in New York on Thursday and is expected to be the first foreign leader to meet the president- elect since his election last week. Trumps transition team has not responded to requests for comment on the meeting, but an adviser to Trump, speaking anonymously, said this week that Trump would seek to reassure Abe and other Asian allies rattled by his campaign rhetoric. Trump had fanned worries in Tokyo and beyond with his comments on the possibility of Japan acquiring nuclear arms and demands that allies pay more for the upkeep of U.S. forces on their soil or face the possibility of their withdrawal. Katsuyuki Kawai, an adviser to Abe sent to set up the Trump meeting, said he had spoken to several Trump advisers since arriving in Washington on Monday. I have been meeting with so many top aides to the president-elect and also I have been meeting with the very distinguished senators and congressmen and they unanimously told me that we dont have to take each word that Mr. Trump said publicly literally, he told Reuters. Kawai said that among the Trump advisers he had met were Representative Devin Nunes, Senator Tom Cotton, and the presidents of the conservative Heritage Foundation and Hudson Institute think tanks, Jim DeMint and Ken Weinstein. Kawai said the fact that Abe would be the first foreign leader Trump would meet since winning the presidency on Nov. 8 was a meaningful signal and Abes aim was to establish the highest level personal ties with the president-elect. That meeting will be the first for building up the great personal relationship between two leaders, he said. Prime Minister Abe will definitely talk about the importance of the Japan-U.S. alliance and that alliance is not only for Japan and the United States, but also for the entire Indo-Pacific region as well as world politics. A Trump adviser, who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said he expected the meeting to set the tone for Trumps relations with Japan and the region.  I think the message ... is going to be extremely reassuring, the adviser said. I expect he is going to reaffirm his commitments to the alliance and the American commitment to being in the Pacific long-term. The adviser said Japans financial support for U.S. troops in Japan might come up but was unlikely to be a focus. Some diplomats say that until Trump makes key appointments, it will be hard to assess his policies on issues ranging from overseas deployments of U.S. troops, Chinas maritime aggressiveness in Asia and North Koreas nuclear threat. A day before the Trump-Abe meeting, Japanese officials said they had no idea exactly when the meeting would take place, where in New York it will happen, who will be invited or whom to call for answers. Japanese and U.S. officials said on Wednesday the State Department had not been involved in planning the meeting, which has left the logistical and protocol details that normally would be settled weeks in advance still to be determined. There has been a lot of confusion, said one Japanese official. Abe, a political blue blood and veteran lawmaker, and Trump, a brash outsider with no diplomatic or government experience, have sharp differences on policy issues such as free trade. But the two may find they have much in common, including pledges to restore their countries global stature and a desire to counter a rising China while improving relations with Russia. Prime Minister Abe and Mr. Trump will have good chemistry, said Takashi Kawakami, a professor at Tokyos Takushoku University. Both tend to decide and act based on intuition. And both are pragmatists who put their countries interests first. Kawai said Abe considered the U.S. relationship Japans most important and that it was essential that it was built on trust. That is why the prime minister wants to build the highest level personal ties with Mr. Trump, he said. Some of Trumps rhetoric suggests an image of Japan forged in the 1980s, when Tokyo was seen by many in the United States as a threat to jobs and a free-rider on defense. His election also has dashed hopes for U.S. approval of a 12-nation trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a linchpin of Washingtons pivot to Asia and a pillar of Abes economic reforms. But Abes personal attitude about defense appears to be viewed more positively in the Trump camp, even if it would like Japan to do more. Since taking office in 2012 Abe has boosted Japans overall defense spending while stretching the limits of its pacifist post-war constitution to allow the military to take a bigger global role. Frankly, the prime minister has been more assertive and forthright in trying to make those changes to Japans global posture, the Trump adviser said. I think hes going to get a very receptive audience there.  Japan agreed last December to boost spending for U.S. forces in Japan by 1.4 percent for the next five years, at an average of 189.3 billion yen  ($1.74 billion) per year. Defence Minister Tomomi Inada has said Tokyo was paying enough. However, defense spending still stands at just over 1 percent of GDP against over 3 percent in the United States.

European leaders and Obama to discuss Russia sanctions in Berlin: sources,"BERLIN (Reuters) - European leaders and President Barack Obama on Friday will discuss extending sanctions imposed on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine, and possible new sanctions for its bombing in Syria, sources familiar with the plans said. The meeting in Berlin, hosted by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and including the leaders of Britain, France, Italy and Spain, comes a little over a week after Donald Trumps victory in the U.S. presidential election. Trump has indicated that he will seek a rapprochement with Russia, raising doubts in Europe about the future of the sanctions regime introduced by Washington and Brussels in 2014 following Russias intervention in eastern Ukraine. A German official said the plan was to agree a rollover of EU sanctions against Russia, which are due to expire at the end of January, in the coming weeks. There is concern that Trump might move in the opposite direction after his inauguration on Jan. 20. European leaders will therefore be seeking clarity from Obama, who met Trump last week and said afterwards the president-elect would maintain core relationships around the world, including with NATO. Obama arrived in Berlin on Wednesday evening after visiting Greece.  Were in a really critical situation, said the German official. We have to prevent a situation where the EU rolls over the sanctions and then the new U.S. president comes in and lifts them. Obama and Merkel are expected to hold talks on Thursday followed by a news conference at which they will raise the issue of Syria, a source said. European officials fear that Russia will use the time before Trumps inauguration to launch new offensives in Syria and Ukraine. Two diplomatic sources said the issue of Syria would also come up at the Friday meeting. Syria will definitely be on the agenda, said one, citing coordinated Russian missile strikes against rebels in Syria launched on Tuesday from an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean. The Kremlin has said it is maintaining a moratorium on air strikes in the city of Aleppo. European Union leaders last month condemned Russia for its bombing of civilians in Aleppo and signaled that they could introduce new sanctions for its actions there if the bombing continued. The Syrian opposition has been pressing Western countries to expand sanctions to include some Russian firms that are supplying weapons and bank notes to Syria. Syrian opposition leaders are due to meet with EU leaders, including EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, in Brussels on Friday. Another source said European leaders were keen to send a signal to Trump, making it more difficult for him to reverse U.S. policy and cosy up to Russia. ",politicsNews,"November 16, 2016 ",1

Top U.S. diplomat role an unlikely fit for 'tough guy' Giuliani,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is now the leading candidate to become President-elect Donald Trumps secretary of state, but even some Republicans say his tough-guy personality and global business ties may be at odds with international diplomacy. Giuliani, 72, has been one of Trumps most vocal and high-profile supporters, and according to sources close to him and Trump, he is eager to become the top U.S. diplomat and expects a decision by Trump as early as next week. The other top candidate, the sources said, is former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, a foreign policy hawk. New York mayor at the time of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks by al Qaeda militants, Giuliani is also considered a hard-liner on national security matters, but he has little diplomatic experience. Still, some prominent Republicans said he is qualified to take command of U.S. diplomacy at a time of chaos in the Middle East, rising nationalism in much of Europe, and growing challenges from Russia and China. Senator Lindsey Graham, a respected conservative voice on defense and foreign policy who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee and who made a rather short-lived bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, on Tuesday called Giuliani competent and capable of being secretary of state.  Rudy is an internationally-known figure. Hes a personal friend. He has dealt with the unimaginable, which was 9/11. Hes a loyal supporter of President Trump. He should be rewarded in my view, Graham told reporters. Giuliani himself extolled his foreign policy credentials in an interview with Fox News Channels Sean Hannity on Tuesday.  Ive been in 80 countries, 150 different foreign trips, Giuliani said. A lot of it for different reasons. Speeches. Security consulting, where I helped bring down crime. Critics, however, said they are troubled not only by Giulianis combative nature and lack of experience, but also by his international business ties and his lucrative speaking engagements for an Iranian exile group that was on the U.S. terrorism list until four years ago. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its consideration of Giuliani for secretary of state. After serving as New York mayor for eight years, Giuliani founded management and security consulting firm Giuliani Partners in 2002, which he left in 2007 when he campaigned for the Republican presidential nomination and questions were raised about his foreign business ties.  The firms clients have included Colombia and, reportedly, the government of Qatar. Giuliani appears to have resumed work with the firm after his 2007 failed presidential bid, and is listed as chairman and chief executive officer of Giuliani Partners on the Giuliani Security and Safety website. He joined a Texas law firm as a name partner in 2005. The firm did lobbying work for Citgo, a U.S. subsidiary of Venezuelas state-owned oil company, which at the time was  controlled by President Hugo Chavez, Venezuelas late socialist ruler. At the time, Giulianis office said he was not personally involved in the lobbying and said Giuliani believed that Chavez is not a friend of the United States. Giulianis dealings in Russia may face scrutiny in Senate confirmation hearings. His ties to TriGlobal Strategic Ventures, a consulting firm that helps Western clients advance their business interests in emerging markets of the former Soviet Union, date back to 2004, when Giuliani visited Moscow to meet Russian businessmen and politicians, according to the companys website. The consulting firms president, Vitaly Pruss, has created and developed strategies for companies including Russian oil pipeline monopoly Transneft and has worked closely with Giuliani Partners, according to his profile on TriGlobals website. State-owned Transneft was among Russian oil companies targeted with sanctions by Western powers following Russias annexation of Crimea under President Vladimir Putin. Giuliani also has spoken in support of the Peoples Mujahedin Organization of Iran, a group of Islamic leftists who opposed Irans late shah, but fell out with the Shiite clerics who took power after the 1979 revolution and later aligned itself with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. The U.S. government considered it a terrorist organization until 2012. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who also was a contender for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, told CNN on Tuesday he was worried about Giulianis ties to foreign governments.  Whether or notyou have divided loyalties obviously is very important, Paul said. I hope Donald Trump will pick somebody consistent with what he said on the campaign trail - Iraq war was a mistake, regime change in the Middle East is a mistake. You want to have a diplomat in charge of diplomacy, he said. Critics, however, say the bottom line is that Giuliani is no diplomat, either personally or professionally.    The challenge for Giuliani if he becomes secretary of state would be to move beyond the tough guy persona he cultivated as prosecutor and mayor and instead stand up for some of the basic principles of human rights, democratic accountability, and the rule of law that enhance rather than shrink Americas influence abroad, said Ken Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, who worked for Giuliani when he was a federal prosecutor between 1983 and 1987.

"Despite Trump, U.S. lawmakers want response to Russia","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior Democratic and Republican U.S. lawmakers want Washington to respond to Russias alleged interference in the U.S. election and actions in Ukraine and Syria, despite Republican President-elect Donald Trumps calls to improve relations. Senator Ben Cardin said on Wednesday he was working on what he described as comprehensive legislation to respond to Russian actions contrary to U.S. interests in Europe and Syria, as well as cyber attacks blamed on Moscow during the campaign. Russia presents a very serious challenge for America. Theyre not our partner. Theyre a bully, Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters.  Whether you attack us by MiG (fighter jet) or by mouse, its an attack. It requires a response. Its clear that they were responsible for the cyber attack on our country in this past election, Cardin said. Other lawmakers have also called for action against Russia as they returned to Washington this week for the first time since Trump won the Nov. 8 U.S. election. On Tuesday, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, one of his partys senior foreign policy voices, told reporters he wanted Senate hearings on whether Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered in the election. We cant sit on the sidelines, Graham said.  During the campaign, Trumps Democratic rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, criticized him for praising Putin as a strong leader and saying ties with Russia should be improved at a time when Moscow and Washington are at odds over Syria and Ukraine. Trump also worried U.S. allies with comments questioning NATOs mutual self-defense pledge and suggesting he might recognize Russias 2014 annexation of Ukraines Crimea region. Cardin declined to provide specifics about his legislation ahead of a planned speech on Thursday on Russia policy. When asked if it would include additional sanctions, he said, It will be comprehensive. He said he thought it would be difficult to pass a bill before the current Congress wraps up next month, but that he hoped to lay the groundwork for future action. Cardin also said he wanted Obama to act before he leaves office on Jan. 20. Congress has already passed legislation giving the president the authority to take actions including imposing additional sanctions or sending more arms to Ukraine.

"No better U.S. ambassador for Prague than Trump's ex-wife, says Czech president","PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech President Milos Zeman has thrown his support behind a bid by Ivana Trump, the ex-wife of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, to become the next ambassador to the country of her birth. They could not send a better U.S. ambassador to Prague, Zeman told her in a telephone call on Wednesday, the presidents office said in a statement. Ivana Trump told the New York Post last week she would suggest to her ex-husband that she become ambassador to the Czech Republic. The 67-year-old socialite, born in Zlin in what was then Czechoslovakia, told the paper the country was where Im from and my language and everybody knows me. Her suggestion, reported by Czech media over the weekend, has been welcomed by other politicians but most enthusiastically by the presidents office, whose spokesman said on Twitter it was a great choice. It was another sign of a sharp pro-American U-turn by the Czech presidential administration. Zeman was one of the few European politicians who vocally backed Trump in his campaign for the U.S. presidency. After the real estate billionaire won the election in a surprise victory a week ago, Zeman held a rare press briefing in which said he was very happy with Trumps victory and that the two shared opinions on immigration and terrorism. Like Trump, the outspoken Czech president has often railed against elites critical of his leadership and has warm views towards Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Unlike Trump, Zeman is very keen on deepening ties with China. Despite his countrys NATO membership, Zeman has often repeated the Russian line on the conflict in Ukraine and was not invited to the White House under President Barack Obama.  He has had an open feud with current U.S. ambassador to Prague, Andrew Schapiro. In 2015, he closed the door of Prague Castle to the envoy for a time, after he made comments perceived as critical of the Czech presidents decision to attend a World War Two commemoration in Moscow. The presidents spokesman, Jiri Ovcacek, tweeted last week that a beautiful gift for my January birthday will be the exit of the current ambassador. ",politicsNews,"November 16, 2016 ",1
Trump adviser calls for tax reform as bipartisan 'jobs' bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A co-author of U.S. President-elect Donald Trumps tax plan called on Congress Wednesday to pursue corporate tax reform as a bipartisan jobs bill that could finance a massive new infrastructure program while slashing business tax rates. Stephen Moore, a Heritage Foundation fellow who advised the Trump campaign, said he would recommend that Trump pursue tax reform along two tracks, by focusing on business taxes in his first 150 days and leaving the politically more challenging task of reforming individual taxes for later. Trump and Republicans in Congress are trying to hammer out a legislative agenda on tax reform. Moore, at a forum hosted by Politico, called for a plan that would attract Democratic support, suggesting an outcome that could deviate markedly from the House of Representatives blueprint promoted by Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican. Trumps proposal would reduce the official corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, allow corporations to repatriate overseas profits at a 10 percent rate and reduce the top individual tax rate to 33 percent from 39.6 percent.   Moore estimated that the cuts would lead to a revenue loss of about $3 trillion over 10 years, for which Trump would compensate with spending cuts. But he said it would broaden the tax base by adding 1 percent of growth to the U.S. economy.   Thats the plan: try to pass a tax cut ... and then make up the difference by cutting government spending, he said. But some analysts warn of a bigger toll. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center forecasts that the Trump plan would cause the federal debt to soar by $7 trillion over its first decade, including added interest costs and macroeconomic effects. Trump and Congress would be able to sell the legislation as a job creation bill by linking corporate tax reform to infrastructure spending, Moore said. The combination would also increase the chances of gaining support from Democrats, who have favored such a link. I would label this a jobs bill, Moore said. Moore estimated that taxing repatriated overseas corporate profits could raise $100 billion to $150 billion for infrastructure spending. U.S. corporations are estimated to have $2.6 trillion in profits stashed overseas. He spoke to House Republican whip Steve Scalise and other lawmakers on Tuesday about using reform to fund infrastructure.  The disagreements, I think, on the Republican side of the aisle, are very easily reconcilable, he said. ",politicsNews,"November 16, 2016 ",1
Chicago City Council passes mayor's 2017 budget,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Chicago City Council on Wednesday approved Mayor Rahm Emanuels fiscal 2017 budget which calls for a tax on plastic bags and the first phase of hiring more than 900 police officers. The council voted 48-0 for the budget which begins on Jan. 1. Emanuel last month unveiled his $9.8 billion all-funds spending plan, which includes $3.7 billion for operations. The budget relies on $82.3 million in revenue growth, savings from efficiencies, and a few one-time measures - but no big tax hike. To think that were on the verge today of passing a budget with almost unanimity is remarkable, Alderman Ed Burke said just before the vote. Emanuel last year pushed through a $543 million phased-in property tax increase for police and firefighter retirement systems. The city enacted a new tax on water and sewer usage in September to rescue its largest pension fund for municipal workers from insolvency. The council previously increased a telephone surcharge for laborers pensions. Credit ratings for the nations third-largest city have been deteriorating due largely to an unfunded pension liability that stood at $33.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2015 for Chicagos four retirement systems.  The new budget includes a 7-cent fee on store bags and parking rate hikes. It also accommodates the initial phase of the mayors two-year plan to add 970 police positions to address the citys sharp spike in violence. This is the first year in recent memory that weve made investments in public safety with the addition of 1,000 police officers, said Alderman Jason Earvin. And we can direct investment in some of the most challenged communities ... and with our youth in some of the most troubled parts of the city. After the vote, Emanuel noted record-high summer job creation for youth, record-high project starts in commercial and residential real estate and the city using reforms to place pensions on the path to solvency. Chicagos employment is at a 15-year high that we havent seen since 2000 since the tech bubble, Emanuel said. What we have done, not just today, but over the last five years is give people confidence in the city that we are going to take care of our business, get our fiscal house in order.

"In valedictory speech, Obama takes note of values he sought in office","ATHENS (Reuters) - President Barack Obama extolled the strengths of democracy from its Greek birthplace on Wednesday in a valedictory speech aimed at highlighting the values he sought to respect in office and prodding his Republican successor, Donald Trump, to follow suit. On a farewell trip to Europe, Obama tried to reassure allies that core U.S. priorities, including a commitment to the NATO military alliance, would continue under Trump, despite the New York businessmans campaign trail statements that called that commitment into question. Obama portrayed the United States as an example of democracies prizing the peaceful transfer of power, even when ideas between the incoming and outgoing leaders are opposed. The next American president and I could not be more different, he said to an audience in Athens. We have very different points of view, but American democracy is bigger than any one person.  Obama took care of some local business in his speech. He urged creditors to help Greece dig out of its mountain of debt and called on young people to stay in the country to spur its economic recovery. But his broader message extended beyond Athens.  Step-by-step, Obama listed the values of U.S. democracy that he and fellow Democrats in the United States have accused Trump of violating during his presidential campaign, an implicit call on his successor to change course. In the same way that democracies are based on the peaceful resolution of disagreements within society, so cooperation is  the best way to resolve conflicts with nations, he said. Thats how with diplomacy we were able to shut down Irans nuclear weapons program without firing a shot (and) with diplomacy the United States opened relations with Cuba, Obama said, referring to two important milestones of his presidency. He noted how U.S. democracy had evolved to provide rights to women, African Americans, people with disabilities, and the gay community. Trump has been criticized for his attitudes toward women and for making fun of a disabled reporter. He has pledged to ban Muslims temporarily from entering the United States and to deport undocumented immigrants who are living in the country illegally. Democracy is why the United States welcomes people of all races, and all religions and all backgrounds and immigrants who strive to give their children a better life, Obama said. Our democracies show that we are stronger than terrorists, fundamentalists and absolutists, who cant tolerate difference.  Democracy is stronger than organizations like ISIS, he said, using one of the names for Islamic State. Because our democracies are inclusive, we are able to welcome people, and refugees in need, to our countries. And nowhere have we seen that compassion more evident than here in Greece, he said, referring to the Greek response to Europes migrant crisis. Obama highlighted the importance of a free press to expose injustice. Trump banned certain news outlets from his campaign events for writing stories he did not like. The Obama administration has been criticized for its record on press freedom as well, particularly for prosecuting government sources who leak information to journalists.  In his speech, Obama highlighted the importance of an independent judiciary to uphold the rule of law. During his campaign, Trump accused a U.S. judge of not being able to be impartial because of his Mexican heritage. Obama also noted that elections hold leaders accountable. Any action by a president or any result of an election or any legislation that is proven flawed can be corrected through the process of democracy, he said. ",politicsNews,"November 16, 2016 ",1
Trump infrastructure plan adds little to global copper backdrop,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investors who sent copper to a 17-month peak on hopes for a splurge of U.S. infrastructure spending by Donald Trump may end up underwhelmed given that the plans, even if successful, would add only modestly to world demand.  China dominates the global copper market, accounting for half of all demand, and an uptick in consumption there following further stimulus is much more relevant to the market. That, together with less mine supply than expected, would support slightly firmer prices, but not the wild frenzy that erupted after the U.S. election last week, investors and analysts said. The infrastructure ambitions of Trump I think are meaningless in terms of the course and direction of commodities, said Scottish hedge fund manager Hugh Hendry, founder and chief investment officer of Eclectica Asset Management, which has around $200 million under management.  Copper prices soared about 25 percent from the start of the month to a peak of $6,025 a ton last Friday, but have since retreated to $5,466 by Wednesday - still nearly a fifth higher since the start of 2016. Experts brush off the impact on copper of plans by the incoming U.S. president to spend $1 trillion over 10 years on building infrastructure, even as they are more upbeat on the plans impact on the U.S. steel sector. Unlike copper, steel prices are set regionally, and an infrastructure spending spree coupled with even stronger trade protectionism would initially be a big boost for the U.S. steel market, even though longer term the fear is that steel price inflation will cripple demand growth. Copper consumption in the United States has slid 40 percent over the past 15 years to 1.8 million tonnes last year, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.  That compares to 10 million in China, Thomson Reuters GFMS data shows. Even an assumed 10 percent increase in infrastructure-related copper consumption would hardly matter on a global scale, said analyst Carsten Menke at Julius Baer in Switzerland. This is not least due to the fact that part of the increase in copper demand would be met by increasing recycling, considering that existing infrastructure would be replaced rather than expanded. A position paper by Trump's advisors about his infrastructure plans (bit.ly/2eBQB1Y) published before the election did not mention specific projects, but referred to the broad sweep of possibilities including bridges, airports and digital superhighways. Even if Trumps infrastructure plan goes ahead, the impact on physical markets is likely to be only modest, said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at Societe Generale. If spending goes toward building roads and bridges, this wouldnt be as beneficial for metals demand as extra spending on sectors such as power, transportation and capital infrastructure projects, Bhar said in a note. More important is whether stronger demand in China on the back of stimulus earlier this year persists. Chinas real estate sector is a prime driver of demand for industrial metals including copper, but investment has slowed and builders started fewer new homes year-on-year in September, the first such decline since December.  These are lead indicators for copper demand by six to 12 months, but have clearly turned sharply negative, Liberum analyst Richard Knights said in a note. Hendry, although dismissing the impact of infrastructure spending on commodities, says a wider fiscal stimulus could boost overall economic growth and give the sector a lift. A trillion plus tax cuts are not (meaningless) and would certainly seem to be the first dramatic and politically supported step, he told the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit. Thats a world where commodities, you have to imagine, retain their outperformance. ",politicsNews,"November 16, 2016 ",1
"After Trump victory, Obama and Merkel stress benefits of EU-U.S. trade deal","BERLIN (Reuters) - German and U.S. employers, workers, consumers and farmers would without doubt benefit from a free trade deal being negotiated between the European Union and the United States, U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said. Their comments were in sharp contrast to those of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump who made attacks on international trade deals a cornerstone of his election campaign, saying they have cost U.S. jobs.  An agreement that links our economies more closely and that builds on rules that comply with our shared values would help us to grow over the coming decades and to remain competitive at the global level, Obama and Merkel wrote in a joint article for German magazine WirtschaftsWoche. Defying Trumps protectionist rhetoric, Merkel and Obama said the United States and Germany were stronger if they worked together and stressed that cooperation is now more important than ever before because the global economy is developing more rapidly than ever before while global challenges are developing at the same speed. There will be no return to a world before globalization, they wrote, according to an advance extract of their article that is due to be published on Friday. The two leaders added that Germans and Americans needed to take the opportunity to shape the way globalization happens according to their own values and ideas. We owe it to our companies and our citizens - and in fact to the whole international community - to broaden and deepen our cooperation, Obama and Merkel said. Given that decisions in one country are felt in other countries, it is crucial to have rules like those being negotiated in the EU-U.S. trade deal called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), Obama and Merkel said. Merkel was the driving force in Europe behind TTIP, which has been under negotiation for more than three years. Brussels and Washington both realize it will not now be completed under Obamas term as earlier envisaged. Were campaigning for international laws and norms around the world to be respected - as a prerequisite for stability and prosperity, Obama and Merkel wrote. ",politicsNews,"November 16, 2016 ",1
"Janus' Gross says Trump will be one-termer, in failure for populism","NEW YORK (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump will last no more than four years in the White House, a period when corporations and Wall Street will retain the upper hand over the struggling workers who helped elect him in a populist wave, bond manager Bill Gross of Janus Capital Group Inc JNS.N said on Wednesday. In his monthly investment outlook, Populism Takes a Wrong Turn, Gross also said there is no new Trump bull market in the offing, and that global diversified investors should be satisfied with 3 percent to 5 percent annual returns. The Trumpian Fox has entered the Populist Henhouse, not so much by stealth but as a result of Middle Americas misinterpretation of what will make America great again, Gross wrote. [Trumps] tenure will be a short four years but is likely to be a damaging one for jobless and low-wage American voters, Gross added. I write in amazed, almost amused bewilderment at what American voters have done to themselves. Gross became the worlds most famous bond fund manager at Allianz SEs (ALVG.DE) Pacific Investment Management Co, where he ran Pimco Total Return (PTTRX.O) and worked until 2014, when he joined Janus. He now oversees the $1.7 billion Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund (JUCAX.O). In his outlook, Gross said he did not vote for the Republican Trump or Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, and admitted that Clinton probably would not have done much better redistributing wages toward the working class. He said it was doubtful that Trumps plan to repatriate huge corporate profits to the United States for infrastructure spending would succeed, saying that a similar effort in 2004 resulted in large stock buybacks, dividend payouts and corporate bonuses, but no noticeable pickup in investment. Gross said Trumps policies mark a continuation of the status quo, and that government could step in with a Help America jobs program to bolster labor in ways that overleveraged, cost-conscious corporations might not. Regardless, Gross said populism is on the march and could last for decades unless workers share of gross domestic product reverses its downward trend. Trumps immigration, tax and trade policies might not promote that outcome, he said. Global populism is the wave of the future, but it has taken a wrong turn in America, he wrote. Investors must drive with caution, understanding that higher deficits resulting from lower taxes raise interest rates and inflation, which in turn have the potential to produce lower earnings and P/E (price-earnings) ratios, Gross added. Gross fund through Monday returned 4.5 percent this year, outpacing 68 percent of its peers, according to Morningstar Inc data. Janus last month announced a plan to merge with London-based Henderson Group Plc HGGH.L. ",politicsNews,"November 16, 2016 ",1
Trump denies trying to get security clearance for his children,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican President-elect Donald Trump said on Wednesday he was not trying to get security clearance for his children, which would allow them access to classified government information.  I am not trying to get top level security clearance for my children. This was a typically false news story, the New York real estate magnate said in a Twitter post. Trump was referring to media reports that he was seeking security clearance for his three oldest children - Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka - as well as Ivankas husband, Jared Kushner. Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Trump also was not trying to get clearance for Kushner. No paperwork has been completed or sent, he said. Clearances for the family members would allow Trump to discuss matters of national security with them. Federal law prohibits him from hiring family members to serve in his administration, but all four played important advisory roles through the campaign. Trump has insisted that to avoid conflicts of interest, his children would run his sprawling business operations once he assumed the presidency. ",politicsNews,"November 16, 2016 ",1

U.S. panel urges probe on whether China weakening U.S. militarily,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. advisory commission warned on Wednesday that Chinas growing military might may make it more likely to use force to pursue its interests and called for a government probe into how far outsourcing to China has weakened the U.S. defense industry. The annual report of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission pointed to a growing threat to U.S. national security from Chinese spying, including infiltration of U.S. organizations, and called on Congress to bar Chinese state enterprises from acquiring control of U.S. firms. The release of the report to Congress comes a week after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Trump, an outspoken Republican who has vowed to take a tougher line in trade and security dealings with China than President Barack Obama, will take office on Jan. 20. The panel is a bipartisan body set up in 2000 to monitor the national security implications of the U.S. trade and economic relationship with China and to make recommendations to Congress for legislative and administrative action. Its report also called on Congress to back more frequent U.S. Navy freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea, one of the worlds busiest trade routes where Chinas building of artificial islands with military facilities has raised concerns about future freedom of movement. Beijing and its neighbors have conflicting territorial claims there. The commission said ongoing reforms of the Peoples Liberation Army would strengthen Beijings hand and noted that China was close to completing its first domestically produced aircraft carrier. Chinas pursuit of expeditionary capabilities, coupled with the aggressive trends that have been displayed in both the East and South China Seas, are compounding existing concerns about Chinas rise among U.S. allies and partners in the greater Asia, the report said. Given its enhanced strategic lift capability, strengthened employment of special operations forces, increasing capabilities of surface vessels and aircraft, and more frequent and sophisticated experience operating abroad, China may also be more inclined to use force to protect its interests, it said. The panel said that U.S. responses to the threat from Chinese intelligence gathering had suffered from a lack of a coordinated effort by U.S. intelligence agencies. It said Congress should also direct the U.S. Government Accountability Office to prepare a report examining the extent to which large-scale outsourcing of manufacturing activities to China is leading to the hollowing out of the U.S. defense industrial base. This report should also detail the national security implications of a diminished domestic industrial base (including assessing any impact on U.S. military readiness), compromised U.S. military supply chains, and reduced capability to manufacture state-of-the-art military systems and equipment, it said. The commissions report also recommended that Congress call on the U.S. State Department to produce educational materials to alert U.S. citizens overseas and students going to China to the dangers of recruitment efforts by Chinese agents.

A post-Trump SEC could shake up current policy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It will be a new day at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after President-elect Donald Trump installs his choice to run the agency. With Trumps transition team already in regulatory-relief mode and promising to revamp the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation, some rules already are marked for death or dialback. Expected on the chopping block soon after Trump takes the oath of office is a proposal that would require companies to disclose pay ratios between their CEOs and employees. Another would require companies to disclose whether their products contain conflict minerals  minerals that were mined in a war-torn region of Africa. Dead for now is any prospect of the SEC approving a tough fiduciary rule for financial advisers, say policy experts. Trumps decision to tap former Republican SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins to help manage the Trump teams transition efforts at the SEC and other financial agencies offers a window into some other changes that could be in store. Atkins, the founder of the regulatory consulting firm Patomak Global Partners, is viewed by some to be a top contender for the position of SEC chairman itself, though as the transition head he could also recommend someone else for that job.   Atkins well-known conservative views on everything from enforcement penalties to corporate governance are likely to be reflected in the SECs agenda. Here are five policy areas likely to change. Paul Atkins was a staunch critic of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a body created after the Enron accounting scandal to police and write new rules for corporate auditors. Atkins raised concerns about the boards budget and high salaries, and advocated against prescriptive accounting rules that he felt constrained auditors from making professional judgments. Recently, Republicans have criticized the PCAOB for taking on more progressive causes, such as proposing companies rotate auditors to reduce conflicts or requiring accounting firms to disclose the name of individual partners working on company audits. The PCAOBs chairman Jim Doty, who advocated for the controversial reform measures, will almost certainly not be re-appointed by the incoming SEC chair. I expect that a new Chair will refocus the Boards standard-setting agenda on the core audit function, said Hunton & Williams Partner Scott Kimpel. I would expect a return to the basics. The topic of whether to impose corporate penalties against a company would come under scrutiny. During his time at the SEC, Atkins advocated for an enforcement approach that he said did not unduly punish corporate shareholders that had already suffered from the misconduct. He called for the SEC to carefully weigh who had profited from the bad behavior, and urged the SEC to hold individuals accountable for their actions. Atkins has long opined that the SECs rules requiring best price execution of stock trades actually skews the market by causing fragmentation and harming price discovery by directing orders away from traditional stock exchanges into dark pool trading platforms. As a commissioner, Paul Atkins was critical of the rule called Regulation National Market System (NMS), saying it could impede true price discovery and encourage gaming of the system. In January 2016 he wrote an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal calling for the SEC to do major surgery on the rule, allowing considerations beyond best price and speed to determine order flow. The Dodd-Frank law gave the SEC newfound powers to reward whistleblowers who come forward with tips of corporate malfeasance. From August 2011 through fiscal year 2015, the SEC has received more than 14,000 tips, and by August of 2016, the program had given out more than $100 million in rewards. But corporate America has long disliked the part of the rule that protects whistleblowers from having to report wrongdoing to their own companies before they tip off the government. In 2011, Atkins urged the SEC to require whistleblowers to report internally first, saying a failure to do so could undermine compliance programs. Whether this will change remains to be seen, especially in the wake of the Wells Fargo & Co scandal, where employees who reported internally about the opening of unauthorized accounts were fired. Atkins cares deeply about the commission and its enforcement program, said Jordan Thomas, a whistleblower attorney at Labaton Sucharow who previously worked in the SECs enforcement division during Atkins tenure. I find it very hard to believe that he would support undermining such a successful program. Atkins was a strong proponent of the 2012 Jump Start Our Business Startups Act, which scaled back some SEC rules to help smaller companies raise capital. In testimony on Capitol Hill, Atkins advocated for additional steps to be taken to help smaller companies, including rules to help create venture exchanges for mid-cap stocks and broadening efforts to exempt private capital-raising rules from regulation by states.

"Obama, on last trip to Europe, warns against nationalism, populism","ATHENS (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama, stung by the surprise victory of Donald Trump in last weeks U.S. election, warned on Tuesday against a rise in nationalism and said a backlash against globalization had stoked populist movements at home and abroad. Obama said distrust of elites and governing institutions had  fed success in the U.S. election for Senator Bernie Sanders, who challenged Hillary Clinton in a drawn-out Democratic primary contest, and for Trump, a former reality TV star who bested the former secretary of state in the U.S. presidential race. When you see a Donald Trump and a Bernie Sanders, very unconventional candidates, have considerable success, then obviously there is something there thats being tapped into: a suspicion of globalization, a desire to rein in its excesses, Obama said in Greece at the start of a farewell tour of Europe. Though he rejected a direct comparison between the U.S. election and Britains Brexit referendum in June to leave the European Union, Obama said the common theme of antipathy to globalization was at play, spurring populist movements on the left and right in Europe. Trump garnered support on the back of promises to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, ban Muslims temporarily from entering the United States and rip up trade deals that he said had hurt American workers. Obama, who campaigned vigorously for Clinton, opposed those positions and is fighting now to keep his legacy accomplishments on healthcare, climate change, and nuclear diplomacy alive in the face of Trumps promises to dismantle them.  Since the election, however, Obama has promised to ensure a smooth and peaceful transition of power, largely backing off his criticism that Trump is unfit to serve as U.S. commander-in-chief. While reiterating that commitment about a transition on Tuesday, Obama seemed to renew his criticism of some of Trumps electoral tactics with a warning about divisions worldwide. I do believe, separate and apart from any particular election or movement, that we are going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of nationalism or ethnic identity or tribalism that is built around an us and a them, he said. I will never apologize for saying that the future of humanity and the future of the world is going to be defined by what we have in common as opposed to those things that separate us, he said. Unity in Europe in the aftermath of World War Two has created five decades of unprecedented peace and prosperity, he said. In the United States, we know what happens when we start dividing ourselves along lines of race or religion or ethnicity. Its dangerous, he said. ",politicsNews,"November 15, 2016 ",1
"House reauthorizes Iran sanctions bill, sets Syria sanctions","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers passed bills on Tuesday renewing sanctions on Iran for 10 years and imposing new sanctions on Syria, underscoring their determination to play a strong role in Middle East policy no matter who occupies the White House. The House of Representatives voted 419 to one for a 10-year reauthorization of the Iran Sanctions Act, or ISA, a law first adopted in 1996 to punish investments in Irans energy industry and deter Irans pursuit of nuclear weapons. The House also passed by voice vote a bill that would sanction the government of Syria, and supporters including Russia and Iran, for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Iran measure will expire at the end of 2016 if it is not renewed. It must still be passed by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama in order to become law. The Obama administration and other world powers reached an agreement last year in which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. But lawmakers said they wanted the ISA to stay in effect to send a strong message that the United States will respond to provocations by Iran and give any U.S. president the ability to quickly reinstate sanctions if Tehran violated the nuclear agreement. Even after a hard-fought election here at home and power changing hands, American leadership on the global stage wont falter, said Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, a bill sponsor. Republican Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the bills lead sponsor, called the ISA a critical tool. Its expiration would compound the damage done by the presidents dangerous nuclear deal and send a message that the United States will no longer oppose the destructive role of Iran in the Middle East, said Royce. The vote took place one week after Republican Donald Trump was elected U.S. president. Congressional Republicans unanimously opposed the nuclear deal, along with about two dozen Democrats, and Trump has also strongly criticized it. Lawmakers from both parties said they hoped bipartisan support for a tough line against Iran would continue under the new president. There was no immediate word from Senate leaders on when the ISA and the Syria measure might be taken up in that chamber. Many Senate Democrats favor a clean renewal of the ISA, like the one that passed in the House. But other lawmakers have pushed to add new sanctions such as some specifically targeting Irans ballistic missile tests. ",politicsNews,"November 15, 2016 ",1
Trump transition clears first paperwork hurdle: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said it received a signed memorandum of understanding from Vice President-elect Mike Pence on Tuesday evening, an initial step in being able to provide more detailed briefing materials to the incoming administration.

"Trump shuffles transition team, eyes loyalists for Cabinet","NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump shuffled his transition team again on Tuesday, jettisoning a national security expert and lobbyists from his inner circle as he closed in on naming two loyal Wall Street backers to key economic positions. Trump, a Republican outsider who won a surprise election victory last week, also cleared a paperwork snag that had temporarily stalled his transition after he put his Vice President-elect Mike Pence in charge of the process. Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions, Trump said on Twitter after taking his family to dinner at 21 Club, a Manhattan restaurant, his motorcade slipping away from reporters gathered at his apartment building. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are! Trump said. At the top of his list for senior economic positions are  campaign finance chair and Wall Street veteran Steve Mnuchin as treasury secretary, and long-time backer and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross for commerce secretary, according to Trump ally and activist investor Carl Icahn. However, a well-known Republican moderate was pushed out of transition planning. Mike Rogers, a former U.S. representative from Michigan who had been mentioned as a possible pick for CIA director, suddenly left the transition team. Rogers had worked with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who on Friday was abruptly replaced by Pence as head of the transition team. That overhaul had put the brakes on transition talks with the White House. Pence needed to sign a memorandum of understanding, which the White House received on Tuesday evening. The Trump team still needs to provide more paperwork before detailed agency-by-agency briefings can take place, a White House spokeswoman said. The team will need to provide a code of conduct and certify that its transition team members do not have conflicts of interest. Additional changes are likely. Pence and Rick Dearborn, the executive director of the transition team, are removing any lobbyists, a transition aide said.  This is to ensure President-elect Trumps commitment to ban lobbyist involvement is being upheld at all levels of the transition, the aide said. Trump, who had pilloried opponents for being beholden to industry interests during his campaign, came under fire from his frequent sparring partner, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, for including lobbyists on his transition team. Based on public reports, your transition team and your potential cabinet include over twenty Wall Street elites, industry insiders, and lobbyists making decisions that could have huge implications for their clients or employers, Warren wrote in a letter. Trump has fewer than 70 days until his Jan. 20 inauguration  to settle on Cabinet members and other senior appointees. He will eventually need to fill roughly 4,000 open positions. Wall Street is closely watching who Trump picks for treasury chief because Republicans have majorities in both chambers of Congress, giving Trump a clearer shot at tax and financial regulatory reforms. Mnuchin declined to comment to reporters at Trump Tower about Cabinet picks, but said the team was making sure we get the biggest tax bill passed, the biggest tax changes since Reagan. A parade of advisers had been seen going in and out of Trumps building on Tuesday, including U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, touted as a possible secretary of defense or attorney general. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, also dropped by for a meeting, telling reporters he was looking forward to fighting hard to actually accomplish and deliver the promises we made during the election. Bloomberg later reported that Trump was considering nominating Cruz as attorney general. Rogers was pushed off the team in part because Trumps advisers believed he did not pursue Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton aggressively enough when he headed the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, a source familiar with the decision said. Rogers led an investigation into the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks by militants on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya. The probe dismissed many of the conspiracy theories that had been circulated by critics of Clinton, who was then secretary of state. Trumps team viewed the investigation as a whitewash, according to one source familiar with the operation. Some current U.S. intelligence officials worried that Rogers departure would mean Trump was leaning toward more confrontational hardliners to lead his foreign policy team. Two national security officials said Trumps operation had been slow to get up to speed and had not yet engaged deeply with security and intelligence agency personnel who were ready to start helping them. Loyalists such as former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton were being considered for secretary of state, according to sources close to Trump. Giuliani, New Yorks mayor at the time of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks by Islamist al Qaeda militants, is known as a hardliner on national security matters. Bolton is also a foreign policy hawk who said last year the United States should bomb Iran to halt its nuclear program. Retired Lieutenant General Mike Flynn, a leading candidate for Trumps national security adviser, has called for the United States to pull back from protecting long-time allies such as South Korea and Japan. Trump has filled two positions so far. His choice of Republican Party insider Reince Priebus to be White House chief of staff was heralded by Republican leaders as an indication he wanted to work with Congress. Republicans maintained their majority in both the Senate and House in the election, but a number of Republicans in Congress opposed Trumps candidacy. However, Trumps appointment of Steve Bannon as chief strategist was criticized by Democrats, civil rights organizations and some Republicans. They denounced the former Breitbart News chief, whose website is a forum for the alt-right, a loose grouping of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites.  Neither Priebus nor Bannon need Senate confirmation for their posts, but Cabinet posts do, and some of Trumps possible picks could face a difficult time winning approval.  Republican U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said on CNN he could not vote to confirm Bolton unless he repudiated his support for the Iraq war and bombing of Iran. Paul, who also ran for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, said he was concerned by Giulianis work on behalf of foreign governments. One loyalist who will not be playing a role in Trumps Cabinet is retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who advised Trump after dropping his own presidential bid earlier this year. His life has not prepared him to be a Cabinet secretary, said Armstrong Williams, Carsons business manager. ",politicsNews,"November 15, 2016 ",1

"Immigration hardliner says Trump team preparing plans for wall, mulling Muslim registry"," NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An architect of anti-immigration efforts who says he is advising President-elect Donald Trump said the new administration could push ahead rapidly on construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall without seeking immediate congressional approval.  Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who helped write tough immigration laws in Arizona and elsewhere, said in an interview that Trumps policy advisers had also discussed drafting a proposal for his consideration to reinstate a registry for immigrants from Muslim countries.  Kobach, who media reports say is a key member of Trumps transition team, said he had participated in regular conference calls with about a dozen Trump immigration advisers for the past two to three months.  Trumps transition team did not respond to requests for confirmation of Kobachs role. The president-elect has not committed to following any specific recommendations from advisory groups.  Trump, who scored an upset victory last week over Democrat Hillary Clinton, made building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border a central issue of his campaign and has pledged to step up immigration enforcement against the countrys 11 million undocumented immigrants. He has also said he supports extreme vetting of Muslims entering the United States as a national security measure.  Kobach told Reuters last Friday that the immigration group had discussed drafting executive orders for the president-elects review so that Trump and the Department of Homeland Security hit the ground running.  To implement Trumps call for extreme vetting of some Muslim immigrants, Kobach said the immigration policy group could recommend the reinstatement of a national registry of immigrants and visitors who enter the United States on visas from countries where extremist organizations are active.  Kobach helped design the program, known as the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, while serving in Republican President George W. Bushs Department of Justice after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States by al Qaeda militants.  Under NSEERS, people from countries deemed higher risk were required to undergo interrogations and fingerprinting on entering the United States. Some non-citizen male U.S. residents over the age of 16 from countries with active militant threats were required to register in person at government offices and periodically check in.  NSEERS was abandoned in 2011 after it was deemed redundant by the Department of Homeland Security and criticized by civil rights groups for unfairly targeting immigrants from Muslim- majority nations.  Kobach said the immigration advisers were also looking at how the Homeland Security Department could move rapidly on border wall construction without approval from Congress by reappropriating existing funds in the current budget. He acknowledged that future fiscal years will require additional appropriations.  Congress, which is controlled by Trumps fellow Republicans, could object to redirecting DHS funds designated for other purposes.  Kobach has worked with allies across the United States on drafting laws and pursuing legal actions to crack down on illegal immigration.  In 2010, he helped draft an Arizona law that required state and local officials to check the immigration status of individuals stopped by police. Parts of the law, which was fiercely opposed by Hispanic and civil rights groups, were struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2011.  Kobach was also the architect of a 2013 Kansas law requiring voters to provide proof-of-citizenship documents, such as birth certificates or U.S. passports, when registering for the first time. A U.S. appeals court blocked that law after challenges from civil rights groups.  Kobach said in the interview he believed that illegal immigrants in some cases should be deported before a conviction if they have been charged with a violent crime. Trump said in an interview on CBS 60 Minutes that aired on Sunday that once he took office, he would remove immigrants with criminal records who are in the country illegally.  Kobach said the immigration group had also discussed ways of overturning President Barack Obamas 2012 executive action that has granted temporary deportation relief and work permits to more than 700,000 undocumented people or dreamers who came to the United States as children of illegal immigrants.

Son-in-law Kushner poised to wield clout in Trump presidency,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After winning a primary election that effectively clinched the Republican presidential nomination, Donald Trump paused to laud a boyish-looking 35-year-old who ultimately proved to be an indispensable figure on the path to the White House. Honestly, Jared is a very successful real estate person. But I actually think he likes politics more than he likes real estate, Trump said of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, standing to his right during a victory speech after the Indiana party primary election in May. But hes very good at politics. Kushner, the slender, clean-cut New Jersey real estate scion who married Trumps daughter Ivanka in 2009, helped guide the Republican Trump to victory last week over Democrat Hillary Clinton and is poised to remain an influential adviser during his presidency. Kushner emerged as an important voice early in Trumps campaign, launched in June 2015. He was involved in almost every aspect of Trumps campaign, offering advice on key personnel decisions, strategy, speeches, fundraising and other areas. Late in the campaign, he began laying the groundwork for a possible Trump-run television network, in the event his father-in-law lost, according to a person familiar with the matter. Kushner spearheads his familys real estate development company, Kushner Companies, and is the publisher of the New York Observer weekly newspaper, which he acquired at age 25. While a federal anti-nepotism law prohibits a president from hiring family members to serve in his administration, Kushner is set to remain a key insider and trusted confidant. Reince Priebus, appointed Trumps White House chief of staff on Sunday, told NBCs Today show on Monday that Kushner obviously will be very involved in decision-making. Kushner serves on Trumps transition executive committee. Kushner is a Harvard graduate with a New York University law degree and a masters in business administration. Like Trump, Kushner followed in the footsteps of a real estate powerhouse father. His father, Charles Kushner, is a real estate developer, philanthropist and major Democratic donor whose reputation was left in tatters after a lurid criminal case. He was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty in 2004 to 18 counts of tax evasion, witness tampering and making unlawful campaign donations. During the case, he admitted to smearing his brother-in-law, who had cooperated with prosecutors, by hiring a prostitute to have sex with him in a motel room, then sending a secretly recorded video of the encounter to the mans wife, Charles Kushners own sister. In an unusual twist, the man who prosecuted Charles Kushner was Chris Christie, now the governor of New Jersey, who also has served as an adviser to Trump. Kushner is an Orthodox Jew whose wife, Ivanka, converted to Judaism before they married. The family keeps kosher, observes the Sabbath and attends an upscale synagogue on New Yorks Upper East Side. ANTI-SEMITISM CONTROVERSY Steve Bannon, former head of the right-wing Breitbart News website, took a leadership post in the campaign in August after it became clear that Trump, his children and Kushner trusted his advice and analysis, a source said at the time. Breitbart News is closely associated with the alt-right movement, a loose online group of white supremacists, anti-Semites and others opposed to multiculturalism. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, named Bannon as chief strategist and senior counselor on Sunday. Dana Schwartz, a Jewish reporter for Kushners newspaper, in July criticized Trump for his Twitter post accusing Clinton of corruption using a Star of David image and a background of $100 bills. Schwartz then wrote an open letter to Kushner after being deluged with anti-Semitic tweets. Schwartz asked Kushner, how do you allow this? Because, Mr. Kushner, you are allowing this. ... When you stand silent and smiling in the background, his Jewish son-in-law, youre giving his most hateful supporters tacit approval. Kushner responded by writing in the Observer, In my opinion, accusations like racist and anti-Semite are being thrown around with a carelessness that risks rendering these words meaningless. He went on to write that his grandmother and grandfather survived the Nazi Holocaust while other relatives did not. I know the difference between actual, dangerous intolerance versus these labels that get tossed around in an effort to score political points, Kushner wrote. Kushner became a major player in real estate in his mid-20s, after his fathers conviction. At 26, he orchestrated what was the most-expensive single-building purchase in U.S. history in 2006 with the $1.8 billion acquisition of a 41-story skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Kushner told The Real Deal trade magazine afterward, In New York, you have to act quickly, or else you get left in the dust. ",politicsNews,"November 15, 2016 ",1
Bannon role in Trump administration sets off critical firestorm,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White supremacists and neo-Nazis have rarely, if ever, in recent history been so enthusiastic about a presidential appointment as Donald Trumps choice of Steve Bannon to be his chief White House strategist. Before he took over as chief executive of Trumps campaign in August and led it to victory last week, Bannon headed Breitbart News, a website and voice for the alt-right movement, a loose right-wing confederation that includes hardcore nationalists, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. Five days after Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump rewarded Bannon, 62, a former Goldman Sachs banker and a Navy veteran, by appointing him senior counselor and chief strategist - jobs not subject to U.S. Senate confirmation.  Democrats, rights activists and minority groups were outraged and said Trump, himself accused of racism and misogyny during the campaign, had just flung open the White House doors to hatemongers. Many urged him to reconsider. Bringing Steve Bannon into the White House is an alarming signal that President-elect Trump remains committed to the hateful and divisive vision that defined his campaign, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement on Monday. There must be no sugar-coating the reality that a white nationalist has been named chief strategist for the Trump administration, Pelosi said. The Southern Poverty Law Center, the Anti-Defamation League and the Council on AmericanIslamic Relations (CAIR) also denounced Bannon. Bannon, who grew up in a Democratic family, has a reputation of trying to tear down a Republican Party establishment that he deemed too soft and too entrenched. As a senior adviser to the Republican Trump, Bannon will be expected by far-right groups to champion their views and make sure that Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, keeps such campaign promises as building a wall on the southern U.S. border, cracking down on Muslims entering the country and restricting the influx of Syrian war refugees. Perhaps The Donald is for real, Rocky Suhayda, chairman of the American Nazi Party, told CNN. David Duke, a longtime leader of Ku Klux Klan movements, and Richard Spencer, a white nationalist who runs the National Policy Institute, were among the leading alt-right figures to praise Bannons appointment. In remarks published in the New York Times on Tuesday, Bannon ascribed his interest in populism and American nationalism to a desire to curb what he views as the corrosive effects of globalization. He rejected what he called the ethno-nationalist tendencies of some in the movement. Its not that some people on the margins, as in any movement, arent bad guys - racists, anti-Semites. But thats irrelevant, he told the Times. Political commentator Armstrong Willliams, a close associate of former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, said Bannon was one of the finest and most honorable people Ive ever met and not bigoted in any way.  The Trump campaign had been struggling to manage Trumps unconventional candidacy when Bannon took over. He stayed behind the scenes and devised the strategy for the final days of the campaign that kept Trump on message and enabled him to upset Clinton in crucial states such as Michigan. It was Bannon and Jared Kushner, Trumps son-in-law, who invited three women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault to attend a presidential debate in hopes of unnerving Hillary Clinton. Bannon, looking typically unkempt with mussed hair and stubbly chin, grinned from the back of the room as Trump and the women held their pre-debate news conference. Bannon is a legitimately sinister figure, Ben Shapiro, who had been editor-in-chief of Breitbart under Bannon, wrote in August on the dailywire.com conservative news website which he founded.  He is a vindictive, nasty figure ... He will attempt to ruin anyone who impedes his unending ambition and he will use anyone bigger than he is - for example, Donald Trump - to get where he wants to go, Shapiro wrote. ANTI-SEMITISM ACCUSATIONS While Bannon was at Breitbart, it had stories with headlines such as Birth control makes women unattractive and crazy, Political correctness protects Muslim rape culture and Hoist it high and proud: The Confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage. The sites pro-Trump agenda featured speculative stories questioning Hillary Clintons health and accusing her close aide Huma Abedin of being a Saudi spy. Bannon was charged with domestic violence and battery in 1996 after his then-wife, Mary Louise Piccard, said he grabbed her by the throat and arm during an argument. The case was dropped when she did not appear in court. In 2007 Piccard said in court documents Bannon did not like the school the girls attended because it had too many whiny brat Jewish students. Bannon had a varied and profitable career before joining Breitbart. He earned degrees from Virginia Tech, Georgetown University and Harvard Business School and served four years in the Navy. It was his Navy experience, he said, that led him to shed his familys Democratic allegiance and become an admirer of Republican Ronald Reagan. He was at Goldman Sachs before starting his own investment firm, which specialized in media. Through negotiating a studio sale, he obtained a stake in the royalties for the popular television show Seinfeld, a money-making powerhouse in syndication. He was an executive producer of the feature movies Titus and The Indian Runner before producing, directing or writing conservative-oriented documentaries such as Clinton Cash about the Clinton Foundation, Generation Zero about the global economic crisis of 2008-2009 and The Undefeated on former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.

U.S. says war crimes probe of U.S. forces in Afghanistan unwarranted,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An International Criminal Court investigation of possible war crimes by U.S. forces in Afghanistan is not warranted or appropriate, the U.S. State Department said on Tuesday after prosecutors in The Hague found initial grounds for such a probe. State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said the United States was not a party to the Rome Statute that created the International Criminal Court in The Hague and had not consented to ICC jurisdiction. She also said Washington had a robust justice system able to deal with such complaints. The United States is deeply committed to complying with the law of war, Trudeau told reporters at a news briefing. We do not believe that an ICC examination or investigation with respect to actions of U.S. personnel in relation to the situation in Afghanistan is warranted or appropriate. Her comments came a day after prosecutors at the International Criminal Court said in a report that there was a reasonable basis to believe that U.S. forces had tortured at least 61 prisoners in Afghanistan and another 27 at CIA detention facilities elsewhere in 2003 and 2004. The prosecutors office, headed by Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, said it would decide imminently whether to pursue a  full investigation. The results could lead to charges being brought against individuals and the issuing of arrest warrants. The United States occupied Afghanistan in 2001 as it went after al Qaeda leaders behind the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington. Crimes also may have been committed at U.S. Central Intelligence Agency facilities in Poland, Lithuania and Romania, where some people captured in Afghanistan were taken, prosecutors said. The U.S. Justice Department between 2009 and 2012 investigated CIA mistreatment of detainees, including a full criminal investigation into two deaths in U.S. custody, but ultimately decided against prosecuting anyone. Some U.S. military personnel have been prosecuted for murder and other crimes in Afghanistan.  The ICC was established in 1998 to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity. Trudeau noted the United States has engaged with the ICC and weve supported ICC investigations and prosecution of cases that we believe advance our values in accordance with U.S. law. But she said the U.S. military was held to the highest possible standards and the United States had systems of accountability capable of dealing with war crimes allegations. We do an extraordinary job of investigating ... credible allegations, holding ourselves accountable, holding our personnel accountable and closing investigations in a manner that serves justice, she said.

Little-known Republican becomes Trump liaison in Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Ryan, the top Republican in the U.S. Congress, says he talks to Donald Trump often, but the president-elect has tapped a little-known lawmaker from western New York to be his eyes and ears among congressional Republicans. In the latest example of how much Trump values personal loyalty, the billionaire businessman has effectively designated Representative Chris Collins to be the White House transition teams congressional liaison.  Collins, 66, has been in Congress less than four years. He has no House leadership role. He chairs no committees. He was previously county executive for Erie County, New York. But Collins was the first lawmaker on Capitol Hill to endorse Trumps presidential bid. He co-chaired Trumps U.S. House Leadership Committee during the campaign. Collins said Ryan, the speaker of the House of Representatives, announced the news about his role to fellow Republicans at a Tuesday caucus meeting. Ryans office had no immediate comment. Collins said he suggested the role to Trump the day after the Nov. 8 elections. I said Im going to stay in Congress. But I think I can be a bit of a liaison, if you will, of members, kind of making sure the administration knows exactly whats going on, he told reporters. Trump later mentioned the idea to Ryan, who asked Collins to do the job, according to Collins. Collins seconded Ryans renomination to the speakership on Tuesday, calling the gesture a sign of Trumps support for Mr. Ryan. Analysts called the move unusual. A new president generally relies on the leadership, said Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute. But its not a role with a great deal of power and its not the same as being a conduit once Trump is president and working on policy.   Collins official role is to serve as a conduit to the transition team for lawmakers who want to convey concerns or ideas for legislation and staffing. An aide said Collins has not participated in legislative discussions between House and Senate Republican leaders and the Trump team. Ryan told reporters on Tuesday that he and Trump are on the same page, were working hand in glove.  But the two have not always seen eye to eye. Ryan was slow to endorse Trump for president and once described his comments about a judge of Mexican heritage as the textbook definition of racism. Trump has slammed Ryan as a very weak and ineffective leader. ",politicsNews,"November 15, 2016 ",1
"Greek police, protesters clash in Athens during Obama visit","ATHENS (Reuters) - Riot police fired teargas on Tuesday at protesters demonstrating just a few kilometers (miles) from the presidential mansion where Greek leaders were hosting a state banquet for visiting U.S. President Barack Obama. About 7,000 people, among them many hooded protesters and members of the Communist-affiliated group PAME, marched through the streets of central Athens holding banners reading Unwanted!  The police clashed with the protesters after they tried to  break through cordon lines to reach the parliament building and the U.S. embassy. Some demonstrators threw two petrol bombs at police before dispersing into nearby streets close to Athenss main Syntagma Square.  In a separate protest in the northern city of Thessaloniki, protesters burned a U.S. flag.  The visit comes only two days before the anniversary of a bloody 1973 student revolt that helped topple the 1967-1974 military junta which was backed by the U.S. government.  Obama, who will be succeeded in January by Donald Trump, arrived in Greece on Tuesday on his last foreign tour as president of the United States.  ",politicsNews,"November 15, 2016 ",1
House Speaker Paul Ryan renominated to top House post,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives nominated Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday for re-election to his post next year, as lawmakers giddy with election success smoothed over their differences and pledged to unite behind Republican President-elect Donald Trump. Ryan, who faced no challengers from Republican ranks, was nominated in a unanimous voice vote in a closed-door meeting of all Republican lawmakers in the House. He will face an election in January, when all members of the new House, both majority Republicans and minority Democrats, vote on a new speaker. While Januarys outcome is not guaranteed, Republicans who had been feuding with each other and Trump before the election said Tuesday they thought Ryan was in a solid position to be re-elected speaker now that intra-party tensions have dramatically lessened with the Republican election victory. Politics is politics, but this is as unified as Ive ever seen it, said New York Republican Representative Peter King, who has been in Congress since 1993. Republicans kept their majorities in both the House and Senate in the Nov. 8 elections in which voters elected Trump to the White House over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Ryan, 46, had criticized Trump numerous times during the campaign, which angered some of Trumps supporters in the Republican caucus. Had Trump lost the election, these Republicans and some conservatives who already had doubts about Ryan might have sought to blame him and block his re-election. But lawmakers said Trumps election, along with a stronger-than-expected performance at the polls by House Republicans, changed the outlook. To suggest that President-elect Trumps victory didnt weigh as a factor in terms of the speakers race would be disingenuous said Representative Mark Meadows, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus. However, one conservative lawmaker, Representative Raul Labrador, continued to express skepticism about Ryan ahead of Tuesdays vote, and said he would not consider Tuesdays outcome binding on his vote in January. I havent heard from him what he wants to change  whats going to be different the next two years than the last two years? Labrador asked reporters. Ryan, for his part, said House Republicans would be working hand in glove with Trump. Were going to do everything we can to help him be as successful as he can, Ryan told reporters ahead of Tuesdays vote. Republicans also re-elected three other lawmakers to leadership positions: House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, and the chairwoman of the Republican conference, Cathy McMorris Rodgers.

Republicans to U.S. securities regulator: Leave new rules to Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers told the top U.S. securities regulator on Tuesday they are concerned her agency will rush out new rules in the final weeks that President Barack Obama, a Democrat, holds the Oval Office. The chair of the House Financial Services Committee, Jeb Hensarling, who has been mentioned as a possible Treasury secretary under Republican President-elect Donald Trump, said whenever there is a transfer of power from one presidential administration to another, there is a temptation for federal agencies to rush pending rulemakings to completion, as a way of cementing the policy priorities of the outgoing administration. I would strongly urge you to respect the results of last weeks election and resist the temptation to finalize any regulations, including Dodd-Frank ... regulations, added Hensarling during a hearing on the Securities and Exchange Commission. SEC Chair Mary Jo White was the hearings sole witness. On Monday she announced she will leave her post when Obamas term ends in January, a decision made before Trumps stunning election win. She told the committee firmly there would be no surprise rulemakings or ramming pending rules through to completion.  I dont see any last-minute rushes. I do intend to carry out the agenda I outlined in February 2016 as much as I can, she said. I dont think any rulemaking benefits from it being rushed. Its hard to do it right, she also said.  Nonetheless, White would not commit when asked about a proposed multi-agency rule for clawing back compensation from executives who have committed wrongdoing. The SEC and fellow major financial regulators must approve the rule for it to become final, and the lawmakers pressed White to not bring it up for a commission vote while she is still chair.  White said she could not predict what will happen in the next 2-1/2 months, or what will be included in the final draft of the rule. To continue carrying out its agenda announced earlier this year, the SEC will focus on capital segregation rules, an outstanding derivatives rule, and a staff recommendation on mutual fund disclosure, White said. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform law is considered one of Obamas signature domestic achievements, and federal agencies have furiously put in place new regulations and systems to carry out its many moving parts. Trump has said he would repeal parts of the law, and he is expected to use legislation Hensarling drafted as a blueprint for his plans. Only half a dozen Democrats attended Tuesdays hearing, primarily asking about corporate board diversity and the Wells Fargo ghost account scandal, or blasting Trump. White, an independent, has been criticized by both parties. Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren recently called on Obama to fire her, and progressives say she slowed down implementing Dodd-Frank.  White said the SEC has completed 80 percent of the rulemakings required by Dodd-Frank. She added that she would not want to see parts of the law, including the Volcker rule restricting banks from making speculative investments, rescinded in the future.

Trump eyeing Mnuchin and Ross for economy jobs: Icahn,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Longtime Donald Trump supporter and activist investor Carl Icahn confirmed on Tuesday that the president-elect is looking at Wall Street veteran Steven Mnuchin as his choice for treasury secretary and billionaire Wilbur Ross for commerce secretary.  Spoke to @realDonaldTrump. Steve Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross are being considered for Treasury and Commerce. Both would be great choices, Icahn wrote on Twitter.  Icahn, a close ally of Trump who was often praised by the Republican during the presidential campaign for his business acumen, also tweeted that both Mnuchin and Ross were friends and two of the smartest people I know. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner and Trumps campaign finance manager, has been considered a front-runner for the Treasury post for much of the past week since Trumps stunning election victory. Mnuchins inclusion in Trumps campaign team was questioned at the time by Stephen Bannon, now Trumps chief White House strategist. In an interview on Breitbart News, Bannon asked Trump whether the then presidential candidate was selling out to Wall Street.  The list to head the Treasury Department has also included JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon and Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee. Hensarling has said he would prefer to focus on a revamp of financial regulation, while Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has denied interest in the job in the past.         Ross, a billionaire investor, is a part of Trumps economic advisory team. Calls to Ross were not immediately returned. Mnuchin walked through the Trump Tower lobby in Manhattan on Tuesday morning. He would not comment on personnel decisions but said the Trump team is making sure we get the biggest tax bill passed, the biggest tax changes since Reagan. So a lot of exciting things in the first 100 days of the Trump presidency. With Republicans retaining majorities in Congress, Trump will have a clearer shot at enacting major tax cut and reform legislation and rolling back the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law passed in the wake of the financial crisis. The new treasury secretary would play a key role in crafting such legislation, as well as managing potential new debt issuance of as much as $1 trillion if Congress agrees to Trumps proposed infrastructure spending program. With such high stakes, Wall Street is more focused on the selection of the next treasury chief than it was during President Barack Obamas choices for the post. This time will be different, Gregory Peters, senior investment officer at Prudential Fixed Income, said Tuesday at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in New York. That role takes on greater importance.     Unlike current Secretary Jacob Lew, who is viewed investors to have taken a lower profile focused largely on international issues over the past year, the next Treasury secretary is expected to be a featured player in articulating and executing the Trump administrations new economic policies and initiatives.     A figure such as Mnuchin, with Wall Street experience, might be seen as better equipped to manage the relationship between Treasury and the banks that facilitate U.S. debt issuance.  The last Wall Street insider to serve in the post was Henry Paulson, the former Goldman Sachs CEO appointed by George W. Bush and whose term was dominated by the bank bailouts of the 2008 financial crisis. Mnuchin, whose father was also a Goldman Sachs partner,  worked at the investment bank for nearly two decades starting in the mid-1980s, a time when Wall Street was developing major financial innovations including new securitization techniques and collateralized debt obligations  instruments that would later contribute to the financial crisis. In 2009, he led a group of investors that purchased the assets of failed California-based mortgage lender IndyMac, for $1.55 billion that included a loss-sharing deal with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. After rehabilitating the operation and rebranding it as OneWest Bank, they sold it in 2014 for $3.4 billion to CIT Group Inc for $3.4 billion. ",politicsNews,"November 15, 2016 ",1
"Exclusive: Billionaire green activist Steyer vows to battle Trump, says money not an issue","BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer, who has spent more than $140 million on fighting climate change, said on Tuesday he will spend whatever it takes to fight President-elect Donald Trumps pro-drilling and anti-regulation agenda. The former hedge fund manager from California is putting together a strategy that will engage voters and citizens to fight back once Trump takes the White House in January, he told Reuters in an interview. However, he stressed he was not planning to fight Trump through the courts. Instead, he would focus on trying to present an opposite point of view and trying to get that point of view expressed, and communicated to citizens. Steyers pledge to fight Trump suggests an intensifying battle for U.S. public opinion on global climate change, an issue that has already divided many Americans, lawmakers, and companies between those who consider it a major global threat and those who doubt its existence. Other U.S. environmental groups are also preparing to resist Trumps agenda, with some vowing street protests and more established organizations that helped draft some of President Barack Obamas environmental regulations preparing to defend them in court. We have always been willing to do whatever is necessary, Steyer said, when asked how much money he was willing to spend to oppose Trumps agenda. Trump campaigned on a promise to drastically reduce environmental regulation and ease permitting for infrastructure, moves he said would breathe life into an oil and gas industry ailing from low prices, without harming U.S. air and water quality.  He has also called climate change a hoax and has promised to cancel the Paris Climate Accord between nearly 200 nations to slow global warming, a deal he said would cost the U.S. economy trillions of dollars and put it at a disadvantage. While the approach has cheered the industry, it has sent shockwaves through the environmental movement, which is confronting the prospect of losing all progress it made during the Obama administration. Steyer, who had endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, called Trumps policies dangerous. Every single one of these things, whether it was getting rid of Paris or cutting back the EPA, we think are extremely dangerous to the security of every American, Steyer said. We think it is based on willful ignorance of the facts and flies in the face of the realities facing the world. Steyers main political vehicle, NextGen Climate, on Tuesday called on the Obama administration to defy Trumps pro-drilling agenda by issuing an order permanently blocking all new drilling in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Trump has also promised to ask Canadian oil pipeline company, TransCanada Corp, to resubmit its application to build a pipeline into the United States that would link Albertas vast oil sands to American refineries and ports on the Gulf Coast. The project, Keystone XL, had been rejected by the Obama administration after years of mass protests and lobbying by environmental organizations. Steyer said the project may no longer make sense since a slump in oil prices has reduced the profitability of oil sands production. Steyer, who four years ago left the hedge fund firm he co-founded to devote himself full-time to environmental activism, said young voter turnout in areas where NextGen focused its mobilization efforts during the 2016 campaign was up more than 20 percent from the last presidential election in 2012. Did we get the president we want, absolutely not. Did we get a majority of clean energy supporters in the senate, no, Steyer said. But in terms of what we did, and the strategy we took, we wouldnt do anything differently.  NextGen poured nearly $69 million into its elections related programs during the presidential campaign, according to federal records compiled by OpenSecrets.org, slightly lower than the $74 million it spent during the mid-term congressional elections in 2014, when only two of the six candidates it supported won.

Trump could return Iraq war boosters to power," (Corrects this Nov. 14 to clarify details of Boltons recess appointment, paragraph 8.) By Warren Strobel and John Walcott WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Despite his professed opposition to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, President-elect Donald Trump is considering several of the major advocates of that war for top national security posts in his administration, according to Republican officials. Among those who could find places on Trumps team are former top State Department official John Bolton and ex-CIA Director James Woolsey. Both men championed the Iraq invasion, which many analysts have called one of the major U.S. foreign policy debacles of modern times. Also involved in transition planning for Trumps presidency is Frederick Fleitz, a top aide to Bolton who earlier worked at the CIA unit that validated much of the flawed intelligence on Iraqs weapons of mass destruction programs. Although it is impossible to predict how a Trump foreign policy might evolve, one U.S. official who has served in Iraq said advocates of the 2003 invasion might be more inclined to commit additional U.S. forces to the fight against Islamic State there, despite the absence of a status of forces agreement that protects Americans from Iraqi legal action. Paul Pillar, the top U.S. intelligence official for the Near East from 2000 to 2005, said that because Trump had little foreign policy experience and had given conflicting accounts of what policies he would pursue, the Republican president-elects senior personnel appointments would be crucial. What were seeing going on - and we should be worried about it - is a new president who on so many foreign policy issues has been all over the map, said Pillar, now at Georgetown University. Thus, the senior appointments game that we go through every four years has more consequences than it usually does.   Bolton, who is under consideration as Trumps secretary of state, the officials said, and Woolsey, reported to be in the running for U.S. director of national intelligence, did not respond to requests for comment. The Trump transition team also did not immediately respond when asked for comment.Even if Bolton is nominated, Senate confirmation is not a foregone conclusion. In 2005, Senate Democrats - with the support of a single Republican  blocked a vote to confirm him as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He was appointed to that post by Republican President George W. Bush while the Senate was in recess. Fleitz, in a brief phone conversation, confirmed he was involved in Trumps transition effort, but declined further comment.  A return to power for the three officials would represent a change of fortune for them and other neoconservatives who provided the intellectual backing for the invasion of Iraq. During the presidential campaign, some leading neoconservatives and Republican foreign policy veterans opposed Trump, saying he was unfit to lead. The group saw its clout wane in Bushs second term, as U.S. troops in Iraq found themselves mired in a sectarian civil war, and has watched from the sidelines during Democratic President Barack Obamas eight years in power. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has said he opposed the invasion of Iraq, in which more than 4,000 U.S. troops and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died, and which led to the creation of al Qaeda in Iraq, the forerunner to the violent, ultra-hardline Islamic State group. Iraqi dictator Saddam Husseins weapons of mass destruction and ties to al Qaeda, used to justify the invasion, proved to be nonexistent.  As you know, for years Ive been saying: Dont go into Iraq. They went into Iraq. They destabilized the Middle East. It was a big mistake, Trump said in August 2015 on NBCs Meet the Press program. His account that he always opposed the war was challenged during the campaign by Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, who cited a 2002 interview Trump gave to radio host Howard Stern in which he replied: Yeah I guess so when asked if he supported invading Iraq. Consideration of Bolton, Woolsey and others is another demonstration of how those who supported one of the biggest mistakes in American foreign policy have not been - they dont seem to be sufficiently discredited to be removed from the Washington foreign policy dialogue, Pillar said.

New Yorkers build walls of sticky notes in defiance of Trump,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - This is not the kind of wall Donald Trump was talking about. In the liberal stronghold of New York City, residents distraught over the incoming Republican administration were finding solace a week after the U.S. presidential election by placing handwritten, anonymous notes on the walls of a busy subway station. On Tuesday, many notes offered support to immigrants or mocked Trumps promise to build a wall along the United States-Mexico border and have Mexico pay for it. A better wall, read one sticky note. This is the wall that love can build, read another.  Titled Subway Therapy, the installation lining the underground walls beneath Manhattans Union Square was the idea of artist Matthew Levee Chavez. The last couple days have been stressful and I wanted to provide people with an opportunity to engage in a small and easy way, he wrote in the magazine Quartz. Anyone can post a note, and more than 10,000 people have, Chavez wrote on Instagram.  Democrat Hillary Clinton bested Trump 79 percent to 18 percent in New York City.  Writers of the sticky notes took varied approaches. Some pledged political action, saying Vote in 2018 and I will do my part to change this! A blue sticky note quotes novelist Zadie Smith on the subject of despair, and a pink one quotes Jesus Sermon on the Mount: Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. New Yorks Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo, struck a pro-immigrant message, posting a note with lines from the Emma Lazarus poem that appear on the Statue of Liberty: Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free... I lift my lamp beside the golden door. The defiant stance expressed in the notes is the right message for New Yorkers to send, said waitress Caitlin Cherry, 28, as she paused to look at them. Im happy that people who are visiting can see that not all Americans want this, she said. In a separate sign of protest, three apartment buildings on Manhattans Upper West Side are dropping the name Trump Place and will be known by their addresses, the trade publication Real Deal reported, citing an email to tenants from landlord Equity Residential. Some tenants had circulated a petition requesting the change.      ",politicsNews,"November 15, 2016 ",1
House Democrats mull Pelosi leadership future,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi agreed on Tuesday to postpone the partys leadership elections until Nov. 30 amid discontent among some rank-and-file Democrats over her leadership style, according to sources familiar with closed-door discussions. Democrats in the House of Representatives now are scheduled to vote on Nov. 30 on whether to renew Pelosis long-held position as Democratic leader for another two years. Other Democratic house leadership jobs also will be up for a vote. No other Democrat has come forward to challenge Pelosi, although at least one is weighing what likely would be an uphill bid to dethrone the liberal California Democrat. House Democrats gathered behind closed doors to assess what went wrong in the Nov. 8 elections that swept Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump into power and allowed Republicans to retain their majorities in both houses, although slightly smaller ones than in the past two years. One senior House Democratic aide described Tuesdays meeting as being unusually contentious as members grappled with how the Democratic Party should rebuild following last weeks election losses, with some wanting new blood in leadership. After every single election cycle, she (Pelosi) says things are going to change in how she interacts with the caucus, the aide said characterizing lawmakers concerns. But then, she doesnt do anything different. Its the same inside circle surrounding her. Democratic aides and a lawmaker said Pelosi made the announcement on the new date for party elections after protracted discussion in the meeting. The elections had been expected to take place on Thursday in preparation for Congress convening on Jan. 3. Weve been through hell, Pelosi told lawmakers, according to a Democratic aide who was in the room but spoke on condition of anonymity. And its only going to get worse as he (Trump) makes his appointments and we have this fight. But we have to see it as an opportunity. Pelosi, who has been the House Democrats leader for 14 years and speaker of the House part of that time, said she did not care when the election was. I do care that we have the strongest possible leadership at the table, whoever that may be, she said. Representative Seth Moulton and other Democrats dismayed by the national election results had urged Pelosi to postpone the leadership vote. As we begin the 115th Congress, House Democrats must take the time to reflect on the message the American people sent us last Tuesday, Moulton said in a statement after the caucus. Delaying the vote on leadership positions is the necessary first step to have that conversation, he said. The American people cried out last week and weve got to listen. Representative Tim Ryan, 43, is weighing a run against Pelosi, 76, Ryans spokesman Michael Zetts said on Monday. He is concerned that if changes arent made we will be in the political wilderness for many years to come, Zetts said.   Ryan has been in the House since 2003. A Democratic lawmaker who declined to be named said Ryan would represent a new generation. I think a lot of us feel the landscape has changed, he said. We need people who can learn new tricks and not do things the way they have been done that last 20 or 30 years. But Representative Steve Israel, a member of House Democratic leadership and who is retiring from Congress at years end, said: There is nobody who could have led House Democrats who would have had a different outcome in last weeks presidential and congressional elections. This was not about Nancy Pelosi, Israel told MSNBC. This was about a national Democratic strategy and message that simply did not tap into the unprecedented anxieties of middle-class voters.

Mexico president to show 'pragmatism' dealing with Trump,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico will need to show enormous pragmatism in its dealings with Donald Trumps government, President Enrique Pena Nieto said on Tuesday, as his administration prepares to seek common ground on trade and immigration issues. Mexico is on tenterhooks awaiting the accession of Trump to the U.S. presidency because of his repeated threats on the campaign trail to impose tariffs on Mexican-made goods and seal the country off behind a massive border wall. Acknowledging that Trumps victory had generated some uncertainty, Pena Nieto reiterated his government would pursue dialogue with the next U.S. government to reach agreements. Well have to work with enormous pragmatism to agree whats useful and convenient for Mexico and for the whole of North America, he told a business summit in the central city of Puebla, Mexican headquarters of German carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE). The Mexican president added that his government was committed to providing macroeconomic stability for investors, listing a flexible exchange rate, central bank independence and a solid banking system among the key planks of his pledge. Concern has been widespread among business leaders and officials in Mexico that Trump could follow through on threats to abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) if he cannot renegotiate it in the United States interests. Struck between the United States, Mexico and Canada, NAFTA took effect in 1994 and has been the cornerstone of Mexican international trade policy. Mexico sends four-fifths of its goods exports to the United States. Still, Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo believes Trump will not back out of NAFTA, and has said Mexico could add new chapters to the deal to update it.

Texas eyes 'women's privacy act' that critics say targets transgender people,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Texas plans to introduce a measure next year aimed at protecting women in bathrooms and locker rooms, a move that has raised concerns of activists who say the legislation is really an attempt to discriminate against transgender people. The office of Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said on Tuesday that a state senator will file the so-called Womens Privacy Act for consideration in the session that starts in January. Patricks office did not have any details of the bill, but the Republican lieutenant governor has been a supporter of only allowing access to facilities such as bathrooms based on gender at birth rather than the gender with which a person identifies. North Carolina in March became the first state to enact a law that restricts bathroom access for transgender people. The law prompted a federal civil rights lawsuit and has been blamed for hundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses and the relocation of major sporting events from the state. Patrick, one of the most powerful forces in the Texas legislature and a supporter of President-elect Donald Trump, called the measure in Texas one of his top priorities. Starting in 2017, we will have a friend in the White House who was clearly elected because the people of this country believe in the conservative principles that have guided the way we govern in Texas, Patrick said in a statement on Monday. Patrick has been an opponent of policies under President Barack Obama administrations allowing transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice, saying the guidelines represented federal overreach and could allow for sexual predators to attack women. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy groups say the current White House policies protect transgender students from discrimination and dismiss the safety concerns as rubbish. It is a total misnomer because the legislation has nothing to do protecting womens privacy, said Chuck Smith, executive director of Equality Texas, a leading LGBT civil rights group in the state. The purpose of the legislation is to allow discrimination against transgender children and adults. Texas business leaders, a base of support for the Republican party, in October warned lawmakers in the Republican-dominated statehouse that measures targeting the LGBT community would hurt the states $1.8 trillion-a-year economy and make it difficult for employers to attract talent for crucial industries.

Thousands donate to Planned Parenthood in name of anti-abortion U.S. vice president-elect,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thousands of people have made donations to Planned Parenthood in the name of Vice President-elect Mike Pence, an abortion opponent, so that he will receive official acknowledgements from the womens health care provider, the group said on Tuesday. The idea of making donations in Pences name arose and spread on social media as a protest after Republican Donald Trump won his bid for the U.S. presidency in a surprise victory last week. Both Trump and Pence, his running mate, have pledged to curtail womens rights to abortion. Trump said the U.S. Supreme Court ruling Roe v Wade legalizing abortion should be overturned and that he would appoint an anti-abortion justice to the nations highest court.  Trump also said women who had abortions should be punished but later said it was doctors who perform abortions who should be punished. Pence, whose home state of Indiana has restrictive laws regulating access to abortion, has pushed for Congress to defund the nonprofit Planned Parenthood, which performs some abortions. A number of celebrities have publicized the donation campaign in Pences name with posts on social media, including Emmy Award-winning comedian Amy Schumer and actresses Ashley Hinshaw, Jaime Perry and Amber Tamblyn. They said their donations to Planned Parenthood included the address of Pences office in Indiana so it would get the acknowledgement that Planned Parenthood mails to donors. At least 20,000 people who have donated money since the U.S. election on Nov. 8 named Pence as donor, out of 160,000 people overall, a Planned Parenthood spokesman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Planned Parenthood has reported a surge in donations and demand for long-acting contraceptives since Trumps election. Pence signed a law this year that would have banned abortions due to genetic abnormality, criminalized collection of fetal tissue for research, required fetal tissue be buried or cremated and made women look at their fetal ultrasounds before getting an abortion. A federal judge blocked the law in June. Pences office did not respond to a request for comment. Planned Parenthood, which has more than 650 health centers nationwide, relies on public funding for about 40 percent of its funding. Private donations comprise about one quarter of its revenue, it said in its 2016 annual report. ",politicsNews,"November 15, 2016 ",1
"Obama administration completes rule to curb methane from federal oil, gas production","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Interior Department finalized rules on Tuesday aimed at preventing methane leaks from oil and gas production on federal and tribal lands, one of the last major Obama administration rules aimed at fighting climate change. Interiors Bureau of Land Management (BLM) said on Tuesday the rule, updating 30-year-old regulations that govern flaring, venting and natural gas leaks from oil and gas production, could avoid wasting up to 41 billion cubic feet (BCF) of natural gas per year.  This rule to prevent waste of our nations natural gas supplies is good government, plain and simple, said Interior Secretary Sally Jewell.  We are proving that we can cut harmful methane emissions that contribute to climate change, while putting in place standards that make good economic sense for the nation. Environmental groups praised the rule, but industry and some western states called it unnecessary. One industry group sued BLM. The incoming Trump administration has promised to cut what it calls superfluous restrictions on energy production. An Interior Department fact sheet said that between 2009 and 2015, oil and gas producers vented, flared and leaked 462 BCF of natural gas on federal and Indian lands, wasting as much as $23 million annually in royalty revenue. Venting and leaks during oil and gas operations cause major emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas at least 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. The rule would phase in a limit on flaring over several years affecting 16 percent of oil wells, which account for 87 percent of gas flared, the BLM said. Oil and gas operators can comply by expanding gas-capture technology or connecting wells to existing infrastructure through gathering lines. Operators would have to use technology such as infrared cameras to detect methane leaks, invisible to the naked eye. BLM could also set and adjust royalty rates for oil and gas drilled on federal land to at or above 12.5 percent. Currently BLM has no discretion to raise the rate. Todays announcement is a win for Western taxpayers.  For too long, big oil companies have wasted natural gas that belongs to all Americans with no accountability, said Chris Saeger, Director of NGO Western Values Project. BLM is right to address methane waste from existing oil and gas facilities; these actions build on important state and federal progress already underway, said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund. Moments after the rules release, the Western Energy Alliance and Independent Petroleum Association of America filed a lawsuit against the BLM in a Wyoming court. ",politicsNews,"November 15, 2016 ",1
North Korea does not care who is president of United States,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - North Korea does not care who is president of the United States, a senior Pyongyang-based diplomat said during a visit to the United Nations on Tuesday following the election of Donald Trump to succeed President Barack Obama. Kim Yong Ho, director of human rights and humanitarian issues, spoke to reporters after a U.N. General Assembly committee approved a draft resolution condemning widespread and gross violations of human rights in the Asian state. We do not care about whoever becomes the president of the United States, Kim said. The fundamental issue here is whether or not the United States has the political will to withdraw its hostile policy toward the DPRK (North Korea). North Korea regularly accuses the United States and South Korea of preparing for war by holding annual joint military exercises. The United States and South Korea also plan to deploy the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system in the South to counter missile and nuclear threats from the North. Trump said in May he was willing to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyangs nuclear program, proposing a major shift in U.S. policy toward the isolated nation. However, ahead of the Nov. 8 election, an adviser to Trump said last month he could not foresee any circumstances in the short or medium term in which the Republican nominee would meet the leader of North Korea if he became president. North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006. In March, the Security Council tightened sanctions to further isolate the impoverished country after its fourth nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch in February. Since North Koreas fifth and largest nuclear test more than two months ago, the United States and China, a close ally of North Korea, have been negotiating a new draft Security Council resolution to punish Pyongyang.

"Trump, Pence meeting in New York on Cabinet picks","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump planned to meet with Vice President-elect Mike Pence in New York on Tuesday to discuss key appointments as moderate Republican Mike Rogers was jettisoned from the transition team. The departure of Rogers, a former congressman who was chairman of the House of Representatives intelligence committee, indicated Trump may be leaning away from some establishment figures as Pence takes over the transition team. Our work will provide a strong foundation for the new transition team leadership as they move into the post-election phase, which naturally is incorporating the campaign team in New York who drove President-elect Trump to an incredible victory last Tuesday, Rogers said in a statement.  Rogers, who worked on the transition team led by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for six months, said he would continue to advise Trump. Pence took over the transition leadership from Christie last week.  Trump and Pence will be reviewing a number of names for key jobs during the meeting at Trump Tower in New York as lists for the leadership positions begin to narrow, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said. If the vice president-elect is getting together with the president-elect to discuss names, then I would say that its serious, obviously, he said on Monday. Trump, a businessman who has never held public office, and the Pence-led transition team are working on picking members of his Cabinet and the heads of federal agencies. Tuesdays meeting comes as former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a longtime Trump friend and supporter, emerged as a leading candidate to be U.S. secretary of state. Well, thats possible, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway teased on Fox News on Tuesday, when asked about the Giuliani report. John Bolton, who served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, was also under consideration for the high-profile job, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday. Giuliani became one of Trumps closest advisers during the campaign, functioning as a vocal defender on cable news programs and introducing him at many rallies. Giuliani has also been mentioned as a possible attorney general or homeland security secretary. Trumps choice of Republican Party insider Reince Priebus to be White House chief of staff was heralded as an indication he wants to work with members of Congress, where a number of Republicans had opposed his candidacy.   However, Trumps appointment of Steve Bannon as chief strategist was roundly criticized by members of both parties who denounced the former Breitbart News chief as having made the website a forum for the alt-right, a confederation of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. Bannon has been calling Republicans in Congress to build relationships with lawmakers after years of thumbing his nose at establishment figures in the party, according to website Politico.  People who received the calls, which included rank-and-file members as well as leaders, said the main message was that the Trump administration expects a very close relationship with Capitol Hill Republicans, Politico reported.

Republican Ben Carson opts against job in Trump Cabinet,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, a former 2016 Republican presidential candidate who is an adviser to President-elect Donald Trump, has opted against accepting a Cabinet position in the Trump administration, his spokesman said on Tuesday. Carson, a popular writer and speaker in conservative circles, has been a close adviser to Trump and is a vice chairman of Trumps transition team. He has been mentioned as a possible secretary of health and human services or education. Carsons business manager, Armstrong Williams, said Carson has made clear he has no experience in running a federal bureaucracy. Dr. Carson doesnt feel like thats the best way for him to serve the president-elect, Williams told Reuters. He said Carson would remain a close adviser of Trump and a friend. His life has not prepared him to be a Cabinet secretary, Williams said.     ",politicsNews,"November 15, 2016 ",1
Giuliani is a leading candidate to be Trump's secretary of state: source,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has emerged as a leading candidate to be U.S. secretary of state for President-elect Donald Trump, a source familiar with the situation said on Monday. The source said John Bolton, who served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, was also under consideration to head the State Department. Giuliani, 72, was one of Trumps most vocal and high-profile supporters on the campaign trail, introducing him frequently at rallies with slashing attacks against Democrat Hillary Clinton. He was New Yorks mayor during the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and led the city during the crisis after the destruction of the World Trade Center twin towers, working closely with then-President George W. Bush. Giuliani was an early supporter of Trump, has been his  friend for many years, and defended him vigorously through the various controversies that ensnared the New York businessman. His rhetoric was notable for repeatedly accusing Clinton of having violated laws through her handling of classified information on a private email server while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. If Rudy wants it, hell get it, former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich told The Kelly File on Fox News. Gingrich, who has also been mentioned as possibly having a role in the Trump administration, said he thought Giuliani might have been interested in being nominated instead as the U.S. attorney general or secretary of homeland security. However, he said Giuliani would do a fabulous job as Trumps secretary of state. Hes already known worldwide, Gingrich said. Bolton, 67, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute think tank, was U.N. ambassador to the United Nations from August 2005 to December 2006 during the Bush administration. Before that he was under secretary of state for arms control and international security. He has frequently provided foreign policy advice to Republican presidential candidates. Trump is working on choosing the people he wants to place in his Cabinet for when he takes over the presidency on Jan. 20. In a sign that Trump might be getting closer to some decisions, his spokesman Jason Miller said Trump would meet Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is in charge of Trumps transition effort, at Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday. Miller said Trump and Pence would be reviewing a number of names for key jobs. If the vice president-elect is getting together with the president-elect to discuss names, then I would say that its serious, obviously, he said. U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a possible pick for defense secretary, was seen entering Trump Tower on Monday. ",politicsNews,"November 15, 2016 ",1
Top tax-writing Republican says TPP trade deal not dead in Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady on Tuesday said Republicans should defend free trade and the party should defend the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) in the new Congress. Republicans are going to continue to support the freedom to trade, the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee said. When it comes to the controversial TPP, which president-elect Donald Trump has opposed, Brady said the plan was defensible. Dont withdraw, renegotiate, he told a panel of the Wall Street Journal CEO Council. There is plenty that levels the playing field. Renegotiate. Fix the problems that exist today. Lets find a way to move forward. ",politicsNews,"November 15, 2016 ",1
Obama to reassure U.S. allies about Trump's commitment to NATO,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Monday he would reassure U.S. allies during his trip overseas this week that Republican President-elect Donald Trump plans to maintain core U.S. strategic relationships around the world, including with NATO. Obama, speaking ahead of a trip to Europe and Latin America, said one of the most important things he could do during his visit was to reassure U.S. allies who may be concerned following Trumps victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton last week. Trump slammed NATO allies during the campaign for not paying enough for their own defense and suggested the United States was paying a disproportionate amount that was too much given the changes in the world. He also told the Washington Post the United States could not fund NATO at current levels. Trumps comments echoed longstanding U.S. complaints that too many NATO allies do not live up to their pledge to spend 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense. Only the United States and four other NATO allies - Greece, Britain, Estonia and Poland - met the goal last year. France and Turkey have been close. Despite Trumps criticism of NATO spending during the campaign, Obama said the president-elect, who takes office Jan. 20, had indicated he was committed to maintaining ties with U.S. allies. In my conversation with the president-elect, he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships, Obama told a news conference before his departure. So one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the trans-Atlantic alliance. One of the most important functions that I can serve at this stage ... is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to Americas commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO relationship and a recognition that those alliances arent just good for Europe, theyre good for the United States and theyre vital for the world, he said. The European Union agreed on a new defense plan on Monday that could see it sending rapid response forces abroad for the first time, a move seen as giving it the ability to act without the United States if necessary. The action appeared to be galvanized in part by Trumps criticism. Obama is visiting Greece, Germany and Peru on his last trip abroad as president. He is expected to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other European leaders in Germany and Greece. In Peru he will see Chinese President Xi Jinping and other Pacific leaders at an economic summit. Obama said U.S. foreign policy remained quite stable despite changes in administration, in part because of the breadth of U.S. government interactions with other nations. There is enormous continuity beneath the day-to-day news that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order and promoting prosperity around the world. That will continue, Obama told reporters at the White House. ",politicsNews,"November 14, 2016 ",1
"U.S. internet firms ask Trump to support encryption, ease regulations","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. internet companies including Facebook Inc and Amazon Inc have sent President-elect Donald Trump a detailed list of their policy priorities, which includes promoting strong encryption, immigration reform and maintaining liability protections from content that users share on their platforms. The letter sent on Monday by the Internet Association, a trade group whose 40 members also include Alphabets Google, Uber and Twitter, represents an early effort to repair the relationship between the technology sector and Trump, who was almost universally disliked and at times denounced in Silicon Valley during the presidential campaign. The internet industry looks forward to engaging in an open and productive dialogue, reads the letter, signed by Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, and seen by Reuters. Some of the policy goals stated in the letter may align with Trumps priorities, including easing regulation on the sharing economy, lowering taxes on profits made from intellectual property and applying pressure on Europe to not erect too many barriers that restrict U.S. internet companies from growing in that market. Other goals are likely to clash with Trump, who offered numerous broadsides against the tech sector during his campaign.  They include supporting strong encryption in products against efforts by law enforcement agencies to mandate access to data for criminal investigations, upholding recent reforms to U.S. government surveillance programs that ended the bulk collection of call data by the National Security Agency, and maintaining net neutrality rules that require internet service providers to treat web traffic equally.  The association seeks immigration reform to support more high-skilled workers staying in the United States. Though Trump made tougher immigration policies a central theme of his campaign, he has at times shied away from arguing against more H-1B visas for skilled workers, saying in a March debate he was softening the position because we need to have talented people in this country. While urging support for trade agreements, the letter does not mention the Trans Pacific Partnership, which Trump has repeatedly assailed with claims it was poorly negotiated and would take jobs away from U.S. workers. The technology sector supported the deal, but members of Congress have conceded since the election it is not going to be enacted.  Trumps often-shifting policy proposals on the campaign trail frequently alarmed tech companies and sometimes elicited public mockery, such as when Trump called for closing off parts of the internet to limit militant Islamist propaganda. Trump has also urged a boycott of Apple Inc products over the companys refusal to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation unlock an iPhone associated with last years San Bernardino, California, shootings, threatened antitrust action against Amazon, and demanded that tech companies such as Apple manufacture their products in the United States. In a statement, Beckerman said the internet industry looked forward to working closely with Trump and lawmakers in Congress to cement the internets role as a driver of economic and social progress for future generations.

U.S. should consider Beijing-backed Asia-Pacific trade deal: China paper,"BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trumps administration should consider supporting a Beijing-backed free trade deal in the Asia-Pacific, state media said on Tuesday, adding that China would be relieved to see a rival U.S.-led trade deal wither under Trump. During his election campaign, Trump took a protectionist stance on trade issues and labeled the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) championed by President Barack Obama a disaster.  There is now little chance of it coming up for vote in Washington before his inauguration in January. Obama had framed the TPP, which excludes China, as part of his pivot to Asia and as an effort to write Asias trade rules before Beijing could. China had feared the United States would use the TPP to either force it to open markets by signing up or else to isolate it from other regional economies. Of course, Beijing is understandably relieved that the exclusive, economically inefficient, politically antagonizing TPP is looking ever less likely to materialize by the day, the official English-language China Daily newspaper said in an editorial. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade talks, which are supported by Beijing but to which the United States is not party, are viewed by some observers as a competitor to U.S. economic leadership in the region. The incoming administration should realize that the more open, inclusive Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership will turn out to be a far more efficient vehicle for advancing U.S. interests, the China Daily said. Washington may want to take advantage of the nascent, evolving platform and become involved from the rule-making stage. U.S. influence in the Asia-Pacific will not abate if the Trump administration chooses to engage with the region constructively, the paper said. Such editorials in state-run media do not represent Chinese government policy but they are indicative of official thinking.  RCEP groups the 10 members of the Association of South East Asian Nations plus China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand, but currently does not offer the same high level of free trade openings as the TPP. China has said it will seek support for another nascent Beijing-led trade framework, the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP), at a regional summit this month. Peru, which will host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting and is party to the TPP, has said that Pacific-rim countries can forge a new trade deal to replace the TPP that includes China and Russia but not the United States.

Thousands of students carry protests against Trump into second week,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Demonstrations protesting the U.S. presidential election victory of Republican Donald Trump entered their second week on Monday, with thousands of students chanting phrases like Not My President after walking out of classes across the country. The latest protests came as critics slammed Trumps selection of right-wing firebrand Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist, with many fearing the move could lift the white nationalist movement into the top levels of the White House. The Los Angeles Unified School District estimated that  4,000 students walked out of classes across the city in protest of the president-elect, who campaigned on deporting undocumented immigrants and building a wall between the United States and Mexico. Officials with Seattle Public Schools said about 5,000 students walked out of 20 high schools and middle schools on Monday. That figure represented about 10 percent of the districts student body, according to schools spokesman Luke Duecy.  Authorities in Portland, Oregon, Montgomery County, Maryland, and the San Francisco Bay Area said hundreds of young people marched in protest as well.  Tens of thousands of people have marched in cities from New York to Los Angeles in largely peaceful rallies since Trumps upset victory last Tuesday over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump secured enough votes in the 538-member Electoral College to win the presidency despite trailing Clinton in the popular vote. But there have been sporadic bouts of destruction. Demonstrators in Oakland, California, last week threw objects at police in riot gear and smashed storefront windows. More than 100 people had been arrested following days of protest in Portland, Oregon, police said on Monday. Protesters in that city over the weekend blocked traffic and threw objects at police dressed in riot gear who responded with pepper spray and flash-bang devices. Civil rights groups and police have monitored violence against U.S. minorities since Trumps win, citing reports of attacks on women in Islamic head scarves, of racist graffiti and of bullying of immigrant children. Trump has called for peace and unity and denounced white supremacist groups that supported him. He said on Sunday he was so saddened to hear about racial slurs and personal threats made against African-Americans, Latinos and gay people by some of his supporters. I say, Stop it. If it - if it helps, Trump told CBS 60 Minutes in an interview. ",politicsNews,"November 15, 2016 ",1
"Trump will get wake-up call when he takes office, Obama says","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump is in for a quick wake-up call and will have to adjust his temperament when he confronts the realities of his new job on Jan. 20, President Barack Obama said on Monday. In a news conference at the White House, Obama said the freewheeling Trump could not be as outspoken as he was during the long and bitter campaign that ended last week with the Republicans surprise win over Democrat Hillary Clinton.     Subdued and carefully choosing his words, Obama gave what appeared to be dispassionate advice to his successor free of much of the partisan rancor that marked the election campaign. This office has a way of waking you up, Obama said. Those aspects of his positions or predispositions that dont match up with reality, he will find shaken up pretty quick because reality has a way of asserting itself. The two men met in the Oval Office last week to begin the transition of power. Obama said on Monday he believed Trump would be pragmatic in office and not approach the countrys problems from an ideological perspective. There are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well, unless he recognizes them and corrects them, Obama said. Because when youre a candidate and you say something that is inaccurate or controversial it has less impact than it does when youre president of the United States. Everybody around the world is paying attention. Markets move, he said. Obama declined to wade into a controversy over Trumps appointment of right-wing firebrand Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist, saying it would not be appropriate for him to comment on Trumps appointments. But Obama, who criticized Trumps temperament during the campaign, said it was important for Trump to send signals of unity after the hard-fought campaign. He said the political gifts that allowed the Republican to upset Clinton would be put to good use in the White House. Ive been encouraged by his statements on election night about the need for unity, his interest in being president for all people, Obama said. In an election like this that was so hotly contested and so divided, gestures matter. The president-elect, a businessman who has never held public office, and his transition team are working on picking members of his Cabinet and the heads of federal agencies. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has emerged as a leading candidate for secretary of state, a source familiar with the process said. John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is also being considered for the job of the nations top diplomat, the source added. Giuliani became one of Trumps closest advisers during the campaign, functioning as his most vocal defender on cable news programs and introducing him at many rallies. Giuliani has also been mentioned as a possible attorney general or homeland security secretary. A Trump transition team official denied media reports on Monday that Trump was seeking security clearance for three of his children and his son-in-law. Such clearance would allow Trump to discuss matters of national security with his daughter Ivanka, sons Eric and Donald Jr. and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Federal law prohibits him from hiring family members to serve in his administration, but all four played key advisory roles through the campaign. Trump has insisted that to avoid conflicts of interest, his children would run his sprawling business operations once he assumed the presidency. Democrats, civil rights groups and even some Republicans slammed Trump for choosing Bannon as a key aide, saying it would elevate the white nationalist movement into the top levels of the White House. Making his first appointments since last weeks upset win, Trump picked Bannon as his chief strategist and counselor, and Washington insider Reince Priebus as his chief of staff on Sunday, saying the two would share the task of steering his administration as equal partners. The choice of Priebus was seen as a conciliatory signal of Trumps willingness to work with Congress. But critics blasted the selection of Bannon, who spearheaded a shift of the Breitbart News website into a forum for the alt-right, a loose online group of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. There should be no sugarcoating the truth here: Donald Trump just invited a white nationalist into the highest reaches of the government, said Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, who called on Trump to rescind the choice. The Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said Bannons appointment sent an alarming signal that President-elect Trump remains committed to the hateful and divisive vision that defined his campaign. Even some conservatives and Republicans voiced dismay on Bannon. Evan McMullin, who ran as a conservative independent presidential candidate, wondered on Twitter if any national Republican leaders would condemn the pick of anti-Semite Bannon. John Weaver, a top strategist for Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich, tweeted that the racist, fascist extreme right is represented footsteps from the Oval Office. Be very vigilant America. Kasich was one of 16 Republican presidential hopefuls Trump defeated in the party primaries.  Priebus defended Bannon on Monday, calling him a wise and well-educated former naval officer and saying he had not encountered the sort of extremist or racist views that critics are assailing. He was a force for good on the campaign, Priebus said on Fox News, adding they were in agreement on almost everything in terms of advising the president-elect. Kellyanne Conway, Trumps former campaign manager and a senior adviser, told reporters in New York she was offended by the reaction to Bannon, describing him as a brilliant tactician. Police in New York on Monday were investigating two cases involving swastikas drawn or painted in public spaces, as civil rights activists said there had been a surge in hate crimes following last weeks election. Local media reported hundreds of students walked out of a high school to protest Trump on Monday in Silver Spring, Maryland, and students gathered at the University of Washington in Seattle to protest Trump.

Obama promises to veto bill that would block aircraft exports to Iran,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obamas administration said on Monday he would veto legislation seeking to block financial transactions related to the export of passenger aircraft to Iran, saying it would undermine the nuclear deal implemented early this year. The legislation in the House of Representatives is the latest Republican-led effort to stop the sale of aircraft to Iran by Airbus and Boeing Co, allowed under the nuclear deal. The White House said U.S. partners would view the bill, if implemented, as a violation of the nuclear agreement. The United States plus Britain, Russia, France, China and Germany agreed to lift sanctions if Iran would curtail its nuclear program. The deals by Airbus and Boeing to sell or lease over 200 jets to IranAir would help modernize and expand the countrys elderly fleet, held together by smuggled or improvised parts after years of sanctions. Some members of Congress have raised concerns that killing the sale could cost jobs. But opponents argue that the passenger aircraft could be used for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle U.S. troops or allies in Syria. The measure would bar the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing a transaction by a U.S. financial institution related to the export, or re-export, of commercial aircraft to Iran. And it would revoke any authorities enacted before the bill passed, such as those that allowed the Boeing and Airbus sales. The measure also limits the role of Export-Import Bank financing of sales to Iran. Some banks have been reluctant to finance the aircraft deals, fearing they could fall foul of remaining sanctions prohibiting the use of the U.S. financial system for Iranian business. The House is expected to take up, and pass, the measure as soon as this week. It is not expected to get through the Senate, where it would need Democratic support to advance. Lawmakers expect more efforts to stop the aircraft sale, and the broader Iran deal, after Donald Trump becomes U.S. president in January. Trump has been critical of the nuclear agreement, which is seen by Obama supporters as one of the Democratic presidents signature foreign policy achievements. ",politicsNews,"November 15, 2016 ",1
"Trump win, Democratic setbacks cloud Pelosi's future as leader","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nancy Pelosi may face a challenge to her 14-year-old role as the leading Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives now that Republicans have captured the White House and maintained their grip on Congress. Representative Tim Ryan, 43, of Ohio, is weighing a run against Pelosi, 76, who is the House minority leader and former speaker of the House, said Ryans spokesman Michael Zetts. The party vote for minority leader is scheduled for Thursday. He is concerned that if changes arent made we will be in the political wilderness for many years to come, Zetts said. It was unclear how much support Ryan might have. He has been in the House since 2003. Voters who elected Republican Donald Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8 also gave Democrats a few more seats in the 435-member U.S. House of Representatives and the 100-member Senate, but Republicans held on to their majorities in both. Democrats had expected to do much better; some had predicted double-digit wins in the House. Pelosi, of California, faced calls from Representative Seth Moulton and other Democrats, dismayed by the election results, to postpone the partys leadership election until later in November while a reassessment is made. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, may have given some ammunition to Pelosis detractors on Monday when he said, I kind of like Pelosi staying around. As long as shes there, I think we stay in the majority. The new Congress convenes on Jan. 3; Trump will succeed President Barack Obama, a Democrat, on Jan. 20. In the U.S. Senate, New Yorks Chuck Schumer is expected to replace the retiring fellow Democrat Harry Reid as minority leader. In the Republican party, no one is challenging Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and House Republicans are expected on Tuesday to nominate Paul Ryan to remain House speaker.  Ryan would face an election in January, when all members of the new House, both Democrats and Republicans, vote on a new speaker.  Before Trumps win, some Republican conservatives angered by Ryans tepid support for Trump were talking about trying to block his re-election. Those threats have subsided but not vanished. An aide to New York Republican Representative Chris Collins said, Congressman Collins fully believes Speaker Ryan is a slam dunk to be re-elected as speaker, and looks forward to working with him in the next Congress. Collins was Trumps first supporter in the House. Some conservative Republicans still have doubts. Presently Speaker Ryan does not have my vote, but I will listen to his message tomorrow, Representative Tom Massie of Kentucky said in a statement. ",politicsNews,"November 14, 2016 ",1

U.S. slams proposed Israeli bill on settlements as 'troubling step',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Monday described as troubling an Israeli bill supported by a ministerial committee allowing settlers in the occupied West Bank to remain in homes built on private Palestinian land and said it hoped the law does not pass.  We are deeply concerned about the advancement of legislation that would allow for the legalization of illegal Israeli outposts located on private Palestinian land, State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau told a briefing. If the law were enacted it could pave the way for the legalization of dozens of illegal outposts deep in the West Bank, she said, adding: This would represent an unprecedented and troubling step thats inconsistent with prior Israeli legal opinion and also break longstanding policy of not building on private Palestinian land, Trudeau said. The U.S. believes settlements endangered prospects for a two-state solution and Israeli-Palestinian peace, she said. We hope it doesnt become law, Trudeau added. The ministerial committee defied Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and voted on Sunday to back the bill, which will be debated by parliament on Wednesday and is still some distance from becoming law. Israels attorney-general, Avihai Mandelblit, has called the bill legally flawed in its current form, saying that it contravened private property rights legislation and did not tally with Israels international law commitments.

"'The Rock' talks a future in politics, including potential White House run","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - After parleying a professional wrestling career as The Rock into leading roles in Hollywood, Dwayne Johnson is entertaining the idea of jumping into the political ring, including perhaps even a run for the White House someday. Johnson, 44, who stars in the upcoming Disney animated film Moana as the voice of demigod Maui, told Reuters the excitement surrounding last weeks presidential election had renewed public interest in him running for office. I love my country, Im extremely patriotic and I also feel, especially now, leadership is so important, great leadership is so important, respected leadership is so important, said Johnson, star of The Fast and the Furious franchise  Asked specifically about a potential White House run, Johnson replied: If I felt like I could be an effective leader for us, and surround myself with really high-quality leaders, then sure, I would.  It is not the first time Johnsons name has been mentioned in political circles. Earlier this year, Johnson took to Instagram to thank a Washington Post journalist who said he had a weirdly plausible path to a political career as a mixed-race registered Republican from Florida, a swing state in the presidential election.  While Johnson did not specify which office he might seek, when he might run or which party he would represent, he said he thought that running a business as a producer in Hollywood had given him a discipline he hoped he could apply to politics.  Ive found really good success in being able to galvanize people in a positive way and continued to push them, as Ive pushed myself along the way too, because I walk what I talk, daily, which I think is an important quality, he said.  If Johnson does take on politics, he would be following another pro wrestler, Jesse The Body Ventura, who served as governor of Minnesota, and body builder-turned-action star Arnold Schwarzenegger, who served two terms as Republican governor of California. Known for his catchphrase: Can you smell what The Rock is cooking, Johnson still participates in occasional World Wrestling Entertainment matches, alongside producing and starring in HBOs sports dramedy Ballers and the upcoming Baywatch film reboot.

While he will may enjoy a post-election honeymoon with congressional Republicans, a long-lasting romance is far from guaranteed, given his uneasy relationship with congressional leaders and some basic ideological differences he has with Republican orthodoxy. Following is an overview of Trumps top policy plans: In his campaign, Trump argued that international trade agreements had hurt U.S. workers and the countrys competitiveness. He has promised to get tough on China and withdraw from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, which is still not finalized. As president, Trump does have some power to raise tariffs on countries such as China.  President Barack Obamas administration has suspended its efforts to win congressional approval for TPP, saying its fate was up to Trump and Republican lawmakers. Trump has also said he would renegotiate or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement, the 1994 free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada. Both Canada and Mexico have indicated they are willing to discuss the agreement with Trump. Canada has indicated it would consider a free-trade agreement that excludes Mexico. Economists have warned that such moves would damage the economy by forcing consumers to pay dramatically higher prices on everything from refrigerators to T-shirts. U.S. exports, such as airplanes and soybeans, would likely suffer as well.      Trump has promised to build a wall along the Mexican border, deport millions of undocumented immigrants and ban immigration from countries that have been compromised by terrorism.  Since his election, he has said parts could be a fence instead of a wall, and he would act to deport up to 3 million immigrants in the country illegally who have criminal records. It was unclear where his figure comes from. Think tank Migration Policy Institute estimated in a 2015 report there were 820,000 unauthorized immigrants with criminal records.    Those policies would not come cheap. Trump has estimated the wall would cost $8 billion to $12 billion. Other estimates have run much higher. Politico estimated it would cost at least $166 billion to deport all of those in the country illegally and complete a border wall. While many congressional Republicans support those policies, they might blanch at the cost. Trump has said he would force Mexico to pay for the wall, but he has no power to force another country to spend money on something it does not want.  Trump also promised to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities such as New York and Los Angeles that shield people who are in the country illegally.     More broadly, Trump could shift the broader debate over immigration, empowering skeptics like Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama who want to reduce overall immigration levels and reduce the number of skilled guest workers. That would be a blow to business groups and Hispanic advocates who have sought to relax immigration laws. Trump has promised to repeal President Barack Obamas signature Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, and replace it with a plan that would give states more control over the Medicaid health plan for the poor and allow insurers to sell plans nationally. He would need Congress to act, and Republicans could have difficulty getting the 60 votes needed to advance a repeal effort through the 100-member Senate. Republicans could face a public backlash if they repeal a law that has provided healthcare to millions of Americans who previously had no healthcare. After the election Trump said he would consider retaining parts of Obamacare, including provisions letting parents keep adult children up to age 26 on insurance policies and barring insurers from denying coverage to people with existing conditions. Trump has vowed to make deep tax cuts, while also promising to protect popular health and retirement programs that account for more than a third of U.S. government spending. That combination of policies would massively increase the national debt, according to the nonpartisan Center for a Responsible Budget. He has also proposed increasing spending on the military and infrastructure, but has said he would reduce spending on categories other than health and retirement by 1 percent each year. On taxes, he would get plenty of help from Republicans in Congress, who have been laying the groundwork for a tax-code overhaul that would lower rates and close loopholes. But they will encounter fierce resistance from homeowners, businesses and other interest groups that benefit from current tax breaks. Trumps promise to protect entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare will rile fiscal conservatives, who worry they will swamp the federal budget in the decades to come. But those programs are popular with the American public. Trump has promised a dismantling of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted following the financial crisis, but has given few details. Both Trump and the Republican Party have called for reinstating Glass-Steagall, the 1930s-era law that forced the separation of investment banks from deposit-taking institutions. Republican lawmakers have so far been unable to undo many of their most-despised pieces of the Dodd-Frank law, and many in their ranks oppose a return to Glass-Steagall. Trump appears to be leaning toward weakening the law in a manner similar to what was proposed in a bill known as the CHOICE Act this summer by Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee.      Trump has offered few details about his plans to fight Islamic State but has said he would knock the hell out of the militant group. He says he is keeping the details of his strategy a secret so as not to disclose them to the enemy. Trump said that if he won, he would give U.S. generals 30 days after taking office on Jan. 20 to propose their own plans. Trump has said he opposes accepting refugees fleeing violence in Syria, and instead has said he would create safe zones there, which he says would be funded by Gulf states. Obama has said a safe zone in Syria would require a large U.S. military commitment, something that could prove to be unpopular with Americans weary of lengthy wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Trump has said he would have a very, very good relationship with Russia.  Trump has said could work with Russia to combat Islamic State. He also said he would look into recognizing Crimea, seized from Ukraine in 2014, as Russian territory and lifting sanctions on Russia imposed by Western nations for what they called an illegal land grab. Trump has criticized the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, saying some U.S. allies have not met their defense commitments. In July, he said if Russia attacked a NATO member, he would consider whether the country has paid up before providing defense. NATO leaders say the sanctions against Russia are key to persuading it to change that countrys behavior in Ukraine, where it has backed ethnic Russian separatists, and that the alliance has long been focused on fighting international terrorism. With one vacancy on the Supreme Court and several more possible in the coming four years, Trump will have a chance to put a conservative stamp on the courts for decades to come. His list of potential nominees has won praise from conservative activists and Republicans in the U.S. Senate, who will be eager to help him in that area. Trump has called global warming a hoax and said he wants to cancel the 2015 Paris Agreement among almost 200 nations that entered into force on Nov. 4. Instead, he says he will push ahead and develop cheap coal, shale and oil.  Trumps advisers are considering ways to bypass a theoretical four-year procedure for leaving the accord, according to a source on his transition team. ",politicsNews,"November 14, 2016 ",1
CalPERS chief sees volatility until Trump implements plans,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The California Public Employees Retirement Systems chief investment officer advised the pension fund on Monday to prepare for greater uncertainty and volatility until U.S. president-elect Donald Trump and Congress implement their policy plans. Ted Eliopoulos told a meeting of the funds investment board that Trumps plans would likely be positive for growth and corporate earnings, but the devil will be in the details, and we dont know the details.  Trump has indicated he would prioritize a broad mix of policies, including tax cuts, infrastructure spending, the repeal or lessening of Dodd-Frank financial regulation, and changes to global trade arrangements. Decisions made by the new administration and Congress will have a significant impact on matters small and large for CalPERS and for investors globally, Eliopoulos said during a live Webcast of the meeting, the boards first since the U.S. presidential election last week.  But it is much too early to talk with precision about these implications since we know very little, Eliopoulos added.  We do need to be prepared to address a much different policy environment, new economic and investment challenges and opportunities and be ready to adjust, act, and govern ourselves accordingly, said Eliopoulos.  CalPERS is the nations largest public pension fund with approximately $300.7 billion of total fund market value. ",politicsNews,"November 14, 2016 ",1
CalPERS shared 14 percent of private equity profits with firms,"(Reuters) - The California Public Employees Retirement System said on Monday it shared about 14 percent of the profit made on private equity investments in the past year with firms managing the money. The announcement by the nations largest public pension fund marks a milestone toward greater fee disclosures for private equity assets, which make up $26.4 billion or almost 9 percent of the total fund. The move is sure to be noticed by other state and city pension funds. CalPERS and other large public pension funds are under increasing pressure to track and disclose the costs of private equity investments. A new California law passed this year requires the states public pension funds to disclose more about the fees paid to manage the funds. CalPERS paid $228.4 million in fees in fiscal year 2015-2016, and shared $539 million in profits with private equity firms. In total, CalPERS realized $3.26 billion in gains from its private equity portfolio last year.  The asset class returned 1.7 percent in fiscal 2015-16. In fiscal year 2014-2015, when the asset class returned 8.92 percent, the pension fund paid $431.7 million in fees.  CalPERS has been working with the Institutional Limited Partners Association (ILPA) to shed more light on fees paid to manage funds and profits shared with private equity firms. Few public pension funds disclose these costs, despite a growing consensus from government officials, regulators, and the public to do so. On Monday, some members of CalPERS Board pushed for further transparency by requiring private equity firms to reveal the portfolio fees, offsets or management fee waivers that they may collect. If somebody is not willing to disclose to us these kinds of fees, Im not sure its somebody we want to play with, said CalPERS board member J.J. Jelincic. We are the gold standard, said fellow board member Richard Costigan. Every one of those funds should be disclosing and if they are not, or they are refusing, we should not be doing business with them. CalPERS consultants advised prudence when setting strict new rules that could dissuade firms from working with CalPERS. The asset remains highly competitive, said Michael Moy of Pension Consulting Alliance, and private equity firms have absolutely no trouble getting commitments from investors. You are not alone, but you are darn near it, Moy said. They are very reluctant to give any kind of ground in negotiations. ",politicsNews,"November 14, 2016 ",1
Obama says he hopes Trump sends 'signals of unity' after campaign,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Monday it was important for President-elect Donald Trump to send signals of unity after a bitterly fought campaign. At a news conference, Obama declined to comment on Trumps selection of conservative provocateur Steve Bannon as his White House chief strategist. But the Democratic president said he privately told the Republican Trump in an Oval Office meeting last week that because of the bitterness and the ferocity of the campaign that its really important to try to send some signals of unity and to reach out to minority groups, to women and others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign.

Snowden warns of increase in U.S. domestic spying after Trump victory,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Donald Trumps election as U.S. president raises concern that Washington may increase the intrusiveness of domestic intelligence gathering, former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden said on Monday, warning that democratic checks and balances were losing ground to authoritarianism. Snowden lives in Moscow under an asylum deal after he leaked classified information in 2013 that triggered an international furor over the reach of U.S. spy operations. He spoke at a teleconference hosted by Buenos Aires Universitys law school. We are starting to substitute open government for sheer authoritarianism, a government based not upon the principle of informed consent granted by people who understand its activities but rather a trust in personalities, a trust in claims, a trust in the hope that they will do the right thing, Snowden said. Washington pledged not to engage in indiscriminate espionage following Snowdens 2013 disclosures. But Snowden questioned if that policy could be modified by new officials who have a very different set of values and can govern in the dark. If government does actually win our trust, because they go for some years and they do operate in a way that we should support, what happens when it changes? he asked. This is kind of the challenge that were facing today in the United States with the result of the last election. Supporters see Snowden as a whistleblower who boldly exposed government excess. But the U.S. government has filed espionage charges against him for leaking intelligence information. Trump, who scored an upset win over Democrat Hillary Clinton in last Tuesdays election, broke with many in his own Republican Party during the campaign and emphasized his success as a businessman and reality TV show star. He promised sweeping security measures to deal with the threat of attacks on the United States. His election was greeted with concern from the American Civil Liberties Union over statements he made during the campaign supporting increased surveillance of U.S. Muslims, mass deportation of illegal immigrants, reauthorization of waterboarding and changing libel laws to increase press restrictions.     Snowden, asked if he thought the election of Trump, who has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a strong leader, might increase chances of him being pardoned by the U.S. government, responded: Who knows?

"Putin, Trump speak by phone, aim for cooperation: Kremlin","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Monday agreed to work toward constructive cooperation, including on fighting terrorism, the Kremlin said. In their first phone call since Trump won the Nov. 8 election, they agreed to channel relations between Russia and the United States and combine efforts to tackle international terrorism and extremism. The importance of creating a solid basis for bilateral ties was underscored, in particularly by developing the trade-economic component, the Kremlin said in its statement. It added that the countries should return to pragmatic, mutually beneficial cooperation, which would address the interests of both countries as well as stability and safety the world over. Trumps team issued a statement saying Putin called to offer congratulations. The statement said Trump told Putin he was looking forward to a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and its people. The two men will maintain contact by phone and seek to meet each other in person, the statement said.  Trump will succeed President Barack Obama on Jan. 20. Obamas relations with Putin have become tense over issues that include Syria and Ukraine. ",politicsNews,"November 14, 2016 ",1
Oil mogul Hamm tops Trump list for U.S. energy secretary: sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Continental Resources Chief Executive Harold Hamm is at the top of President-elect Donald Trumps list to serve as energy secretary, according to U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, a Trump energy adviser who confirmed he is also under consideration for the job. In my view, Harold Hamm has the right of first refusal, Cramer told Reuters in a telephone interview. In my view, hes likely to be asked. And, because hes a patriot and an American, hes likely to say yes. Hamm, 70, became one of Americas wealthiest men during the U.S. oil and gas drilling boom over the past decade, tapping into controversial hydraulic fracturing drilling technology to access vast deposits in North Dakotas shale fields. Continental spokeswoman Kristin Thomas said, There has never been a conversation between Trump and Hamm about the position. She declined to speculate on how Hamm would respond if asked to take the job. People close to Hamm were mixed on the possibility. I think Harold would be great in the (Energy Secretary) job. If the president calls, I think he would do it, said Mike Cantrell, a former vice president of government affairs at Continental who remains close to Hamm. Another prominent U.S. oil and gas executive who knows Hamm and asked not to be named, however, said he doubted Hamm would be willing to leave Continental and may be more interested in having a strong say in who gets the job. Aside from Hamm and Cramer, Trumps short list for energy secretary also includes venture capitalist Robert Grady, who served as associate director for Natural Resources, Energy and Science in President George H. W. Bushs Office of Management and Budget, according to Cramer and two other sources with knowledge of the situation. Grady did not respond to requests for comment.  If Hamm is nominated, the Oklahoman would be the first U.S. energy secretary drawn directly from the industry since the cabinet position was created in 1977, a move that would jolt environmental advocates but bolster Trumps pro-drilling energy platform. Trump, a Republican who will take office on Jan. 20 and succeed Democratic President Barack Obama, is also working to fill other top administration jobs in the coming weeks. Hamm addressed the Republican convention in July, calling for expanded drilling and saying too much environmental regulation threatened to limit U.S. oil production and increase the countrys dependence on Middle East oil producers.  Past heads of the U.S. Department of Energy, which is charged with advancing U.S. energy security and technology, including nuclear weapons production and labs, have typically boasted a political or academic background. Dan Eberhart, a Texas oil investor and Republican party financier who has worked with Hamm and has had conversations with the Trump campaign, said, I know Hamm is being seriously considered. And I know that he wants it. A former Capitol Hill staffer who knows both Hamm and Cramer said he thought Trump would be wise to favor the North Dakota congressman, a self-described climate change skeptic who has a history of supporting the oil, gas and coal sectors. Both Hamm and Cramer would be fantastic choices, but I think Cramer brings more balance and stability, he said, asking not to be named.  This is not the first time Hamm has been in contention for the job. The Republican Partys presidential nominee in 2012, Mitt Romney, vetted Hamm to be energy secretary but ultimately decided against him because the two men have differing positions on renewable energy sources like wind. Hamm made headlines in 2015 after settling a protracted divorce case and agreeing to pay his ex-wife $975 million - reported to be one of the biggest divorce settlement in history.

Trump poses daunting new challenge for Germany's Merkel,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Donald Trumps victory has been a shock for Americas major partners around the world. But perhaps nowhere has the blow been more painful than in Germany, a country that under Angela Merkel has come to see itself as a bastion of openness and tolerance. On virtually every issue of importance to the German chancellor, from confronting Russian aggression and promoting free trade, to combating climate change and tackling the tide of refugees fleeing Syria, Trump seems likely to turn Washington from an ally into an adversary. He invoked the German chancellors name to insult his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton during the U.S. campaign, calling her Americas Merkel. And he described her decision last year to open German borders to hundreds of thousands of migrants as insane. So although Trumps election is being seen as a rejection of the political establishment and liberal democratic values in general, it represents a very personal blow to Merkel, Europes most powerful leader. It heaps more responsibility on her at a time when she is nearing an announcement on whether she will run for a record-tying fourth term as chancellor next autumn. Despite the toll that 11 years of non-stop crisis fighting has taken on her, Merkels aides say that Trumps victory and Britains decision in June to leave the European Union have, if anything, reinforced her determination to continue. Given the challenges we face, in Europe and beyond, she cant simply walk off into the sunset. That would look very bad. She has a sense of responsibility, said an adviser. Germans have been falling out of love with the United States since George W. Bush invaded Iraq more than a dozen years ago. But the election of Barack Obama in 2008 was seen here as proof of Americas capacity to correct its mistakes. Obama was hailed as the heir to John F. Kennedy, who came to a divided Berlin in 1963, two years after construction of the Berlin Wall began, and reassured Germans with the word Ich bin ein Berliner. Obama, who developed a close relationship with Merkel in his eight years in office, will make what promises to be a bittersweet farewell visit to Berlin this week. Trumps win heralds a hard break in a relationship that grew extremely close during the Cold War, before wobbling when Germany refused to go along with Bushs Iraq war and was derided by his Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as old Europe. Last week, Germanys Suddeutsche Zeitung published a cartoon of a beaming Trump opening his jacket to reveal the message Ich bin kein Berliner (I am not a Berliner) plastered across his chest. This wont stop Merkel, a restrained politician who prefers small steps to giant leaps, from trying to work with the brash Trump, who rode to victory on the dreamy promise to Make America Great Again. She is a pragmatist who has maintained dialogue with strongmen like Vladimir Putin and Tayyip Erdogan through crises in Germanys relationship with Russia and Turkey. But Merkels statement on Wednesday, in the aftermath of Trumps election, was telling. In it, she set conditions for cooperation with Trump, a provocative message from a close ally to the democratically elected leader of the United States. Germany and America are connected by values of democracy, freedom and respect for the law and the dignity of man, independent of origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views, she said. I offer the next President of the United States close cooperation on the basis of these values. Merkels cabinet colleagues have been far more outspoken. Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier has denounced Trump as a preacher of hate. Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel has called him the pioneer of an international authoritarian and chauvinist movement. The German press has not pulled punches either. The cover of Der Spiegel magazine this weekend showed the head of a grimacing Trump hurtling toward earth like a giant flaming asteroid, above the title The End of the World (as we know it). One of Merkels biggest foreign policy successes as chancellor was rallying the European Unions disparate 28 member states behind sanctions against Russia in response to its intervention in eastern Ukraine. If Trump follows through on his promise to forge a closer relationship with Putin, the transatlantic and European front against Russia would crumble, leaving her Putin policy in tatters. Merkel was also the driving force in Europe behind the ambitious trade deal between the EU and United States, known as TTIP (the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership). That agreement, still in the negotiation phase, seems sure to die under Trump, whose protectionist promises, should they become reality, would hit few countries harder than Germany, whose economic strength depends heavily on the openness of the global trading system. Nowhere would a move toward renationalization be more dangerous, former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer wrote this week. Germany, he predicted, would pay the highest economic and political price if the wave of populism led to a further weakening, or even a collapse, of the EU. Trumps presidency will challenge Germany on a number of other fronts, from climate and fiscal policy to defense spending and financial regulation. Trump has promised to do what Merkel and her veteran Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble have resisted for years: take advantage of an ultra-low interest rate environment to invest vast amounts of public money in modernizing infrastructure. It was ironic that in the same week Trump was elected, Germany was finalizing a 2017 budget that is a model of fiscal restraint. How long Schaeuble will be able to stick to his cherished Schwarze Null, or balanced budget, with Trump demanding that Europe shoulder more responsibility for its own defense, is unclear. But one thing does seem clear: in Trump, Germany faces its biggest test since the fall of the Berlin Wall. To suggest that Germany has suddenly become the new leader of the western world is not only absurd but dangerous - because it raises expectations that simply cant ever be met, a senior German official said.

Its a very, very, very good sign of things to come, Ryan said in an interview with Wisconsin radio station WBEL. Ryan said he has spoken with Trump almost every day since last Tuesdays election.

"Election over, Congress pivots to lame-duck debate over spending","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With a bitter election campaign finally over, the Congress will reconvene this week to try to set aside its partisan differences long enough to keep the government from closing. As President-elect Donald Trump shapes his administration, Republicans are expected to move away from initial plans for compromise funding legislation and opt instead for a short-term measure to keep the government running into next year, when they will have control of Congress and the White House.   Washington has been operating since Oct. 1 under a temporary continuing resolution on the budget. It expires on Dec. 9. Lawmakers will be trying to approve a new one before then. Mired in partisan gridlock, Congress in recent years has seldom completed the entire federal budget process, falling back frequently on stop-gap measures that last a few months. During their lame-duck session starting this week, lawmakers will have little time to draft another continuing resolution to cover funding U.S. agencies and military operations. Congress is tentatively set to adjourn by Dec. 17 and has an additional break over the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. A new Congress will meet in January, with the 100-seat Senate more closely split than before last weeks elections. Neither party will have the 60 votes needed to move legislation easily through the chamber. The voters last Tuesday also preserved the Republican majority in the House of Representatives, though it is slightly smaller, giving the Democrats more power to block the Republicans. Legislation to streamline federal regulations for new drugs could come up during the lame duck session. So could funding for cancer research, precision medicine and treatments for opioid addiction, said congressional aides. Some conservative House Republicans want a budget measure that will expire in March, which would coincide with needed action on the federal debt limit, according to House aides. Others have talked about a continuing resolution that would run until sometime February, giving the new president and Congress enough time to determine their priorities for more comprehensive funding legislation for the remainder of the federal fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. Before the election shifted the political center of gravity in favor of Republicans, Republican leaders had talked about crafting funding legislation through negotiations with Democrats and President Barack Obama and approving it before Christmas.

Trump looking at fast ways to quit global climate deal: source,"WASHINGTON/MARRAKESH, Morocco (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump is seeking quick ways to withdraw the United States from a global accord to combat climate change, a source on his transition team said, defying broad global backing for the plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Since Trumps election victory on Tuesday, governments ranging from China to small island states have reaffirmed support for the 2015 Paris agreement during climate talks involving 200 nations set to run until Friday in Marrakesh, Morocco. Trump has called global warming a hoax and has promised to quit the Paris Agreement, which was strongly supported by outgoing Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama. Trumps advisers are considering ways to bypass a theoretical four-year procedure for leaving the accord, according to the source, who works on Trumps transition team for international energy and climate policy. It was reckless for the Paris agreement to enter into force before the election on Tuesday, the source told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Paris accord won enough backing for entry into force on Nov. 4, four days before the election. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday in New Zealand the Obama administration would do everything it could to implement the Paris accord before Trump takes office. The accord says in its Article 28 that any country wanting to pull out after signing on has to wait four years. In theory, the earliest date for withdrawal would be Nov. 4, 2020, around the time of the next U.S. presidential election. The source said the future Trump administration is weighing alternatives to accelerate the pull-out: sending a letter withdrawing from the 1992 international framework accord that is the parent treaty of the Paris Agreement; voiding U.S. involvement in both in a years time; or issuing a presidential order simply deleting the U.S. signature from the Paris accord. Withdrawing from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) would be controversial, partly because it was signed by former Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1992 and approved by the U.S. Senate. The action also could antagonize many other countries. [L8N1DB41L] The UNFCCC sets a goal of avoiding dangerous man-made damage to the climate to avert more heat waves, downpours, floods, extinctions of animals and plants and rising sea levels. The 2015 Paris Agreement is much more explicit, seeking to phase out net greenhouse gas emissions by the second half of the century and limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. Many nations have expressed hope that the United States will stay. But the host of the current round of climate negotiations, Morocco, said the pact that seeks to phase out greenhouse gases in the second half of the century was strong enough to survive a pullout. One party deciding to withdraw would not call the agreement into question, Foreign Minister Salaheddine Mezouar told a news conference. In Beijing on Monday, the foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, told a regular news briefing that China would like to continue working with all countries, including the United States, in the global fight against climate change.  The agreement was reached by almost 200 nations in December and, as of Saturday, has been formally ratified by 109 representing 76 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, including the United States with 18 percent. The accord seeks to limit rising temperatures that have been linked to increasing economic damage from desertification, extinctions of animals and plants, heat waves, floods and rising sea levels. U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa declined to comment on the Trump sources remarks to Reuters. The Paris Agreement carries an enormous amount of weight and credibility, Espinosa told a news conference. She said the United Nations hoped for a strong and constructive relationship with Trump. The Trump source said the president-elects transition team is aware of the likely international backlash but said Republicans in the U.S. Congress have given ample warning that a Republican administration would take action to reverse course. The Republican Party on multiple occasions has sent signals to the international community signaling that it doesnt agree with the pact. Weve gone out of our way to give notice, the source said. The source blamed Obama for joining up by an executive order, without getting approval from the U.S. Senate. There wouldnt be this diplomatic fallout on the broader international agenda if Obama hadnt rushed the adoption, the source said. ",politicsNews,"November 12, 2016 ",1
"Trump hires Republican insider, conservative firebrand for White House","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday picked Reince Priebus, a Washington insider who heads the Republican National Committee, as White House chief of staff, signaling a willingness to work with Congress to advance his agenda when he takes office in January. But while giving the influential post to the low-key  Priebus, Trump handed another senior White House job to rabble-rousing conservative media figure Stephen Bannon, his campaign chairman who helped engineer his surprise victory on Tuesday over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Priebus is a friend of U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who distanced himself from Trump during the campaign but embodies the Republican establishment in Washington and will play a critical role in shepherding Trumps agenda in Congress. Both Priebus and Ryan are from Wisconsin. But Bannon, former head of the right-wing Breitbart News website, has been fiercely critical of Ryan. Trumps statement announcing the appointments said Bannon and Priebus would be working as equal partners to transform the federal government, with Bannon serving as chief strategist and senior counselor to the president. The White House chief of staff serves as a gatekeeper and agenda-setter for the president, but Trumps statement mentioned Bannons job first. I am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country, Trump said in a statement. Steve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. Now I will have them both with me in the White House. Before joining Trumps team, Bannon spearheaded Breitbarts shift into a forum for the alt-right, a loose online confederation of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semitics. Bannons hiring by Trumps campaign this year signaled the businessmans dedication to operating outside the norms of Washington. Under Bannons leadership, the Breitbart site presented a number of conspiracy theories about Clinton as well as Republicans deemed to be lacking in conservative bona fides.  Critics have accused Bannon of harboring anti-Semitic and white nationalist sentiments. In a 2007 court filing during divorce proceedings, Bannons former wife accused him of making anti-Semitic comments on at least three occasions.  As head of Breitbart, he repeatedly attacked the Republican Party establishment including Ryan, alienating many veteran Republicans. Bannon showed his willingness to engage in brutal political tactics when he instigated the appearance before a presidential debate of three women who said they had been sexually abused by his Democratic rivals husband, former President Bill Clinton. Trump, who will succeed Democratic President Barack Obama on Jan. 20, has been contemplating the candidates for top jobs in the White House and in various Cabinet positions since Tuesdays victory. Priebus appointment could anger some hardline Trump supporters who were counting on Trump to keep his campaign promise to drain the swamp of business-as-usual Washington insiders. Priebus is a longtime Wisconsin political operative who was credited with marshaling party resources for Trumps White House bid. The Republican National Committee stepped in and ran most of the partys get-out-the-vote effort this year in the absence of such an operation by the Trump campaign. While some Republicans fled from Trump during the campaign, Priebus was unwavering in his backing for the New York real estate developer. Priebus frequently traveled with Trump on the campaign trail and was seen as a positive force who helped rein in the unpredictable Trump in the closing weeks. Trump made his high regard for Priebus known on election night when he pulled him to the microphone to take a bow for his campaign efforts. Trump and his advisers already have hedged on some of his major campaign promises, including on immigration, healthcare and appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton. Trump, in an interview that aired on Sunday, backed away from his promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, saying some areas could instead be fencing. Trump, whose pledge to force Mexico to pay for a border wall was a centerpiece of his White House, said in certain areas he would accept fencing instead of a brick-and-mortar wall, according to his interview with the CBS program 60 Minutes. But certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. Im very good at this, its called construction, there could be some fencing, he said. In the 60 Minutes interview, Trump said Americans alarmed by his election had nothing to fear. Dont be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, dont be afraid, he said. Demonstrators in major U.S. cities took to the streets on Sunday for a fifth straight day to protest against Trump. Trump said in the interview that once he takes office, he would remove immigrants with criminal records who are in the country illegally. During the campaign, Trump said he would deport the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally, most of whom are Hispanic. Ryan on Sunday backed away from Trumps promise during the campaign of a deportation force to round up and deport immigrants in the country illegally. We are not planning on erecting a deportation force. Donald Trumps not planning on that, Ryan told CNNs State of the Union program. I think we should put peoples minds at ease. That is not what our focus is. That is not what were focused on. Were focused on securing the border. ",politicsNews,"November 13, 2016 ",1
U.S. protesters march against Trump presidency for fifth day,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Demonstrators in major U.S. cities took to the streets on Sunday for a fifth straight day to protest President-elect Donald Trump, whose campaign manager said President Barack Obama and Democrat Hillary Clinton should do more to support a peaceful transition. Following several nights of unrest, crowds of people marched in parks in New York City, San Francisco and Oakland, California, according to social media. A few thousand joined a march at the south end of Manhattans Central Park, beginning at a Trump property on Columbus Circle and walking toward the real estate moguls skyscraper headquarters less than a mile (1.6 km) away. They chanted: Say it loud, say it clear, immigrants are welcomed here, and held signs such as White silence = violence and Dont mourn, organize.  One protester said demonstrators were reclaiming what the American flag he was holding stood for. The flag means freedom of speech, freedom of religion, equal protection under the law and other values like diversity, respecting differences, freedom of assembly and freedom of the press, said Daniel Hayman, 31, of Seattle, who was in New York for work. Were trying to reclaim the flag and push forward those values. Thousands in several cities have demonstrated since the results from Tuesdays election showed Trump, a Republican, lost the popular tally but secured enough votes in the 538-member Electoral College to win the presidency, surprising the world. Largely peaceful demonstrators in urban areas have said Trump threatens their civil and human rights. They have decried Trumps often inflammatory campaign rhetoric about illegal immigrants, Muslims and women, as well as allegations, which he denies, that the former reality TV star sexually abused women. Dozens have been arrested, including 71 in Portland, Oregon, on Saturday night, according to police, and a handful of police injured. In San Francisco on Sunday, about 1,000 people marched through Golden Gate Park toward a beach where they chanted: Lets make waves. They held signs such as I resist racism and Down with the Trumps.  Across the bay in Oakland, thousands of protesters joined a festival-like atmosphere, holding peace signs and blowing soap bubbles in the sunshine. Many had brought their children, aiming to hold hands around the 3.4-mile (5.5-km) circumference of Lake Merritt in a popular urban park. Civil rights groups have monitored violence against U.S. minorities since Trumps win, citing reports of attacks on women in Islamic head scarves, of racist graffiti and of bullying of immigrant children. They have called on Trump to denounce the attacks. Trump said he was so saddened to hear of instances of violence by some of his supporters against minorities, according to a transcript released on Sunday of an interview with the CBS program 60 Minutes. Kellyanne Conway, Trumps campaign manager, said on Fox News on Sunday that she was sure many of the protesters were paid professionals, although she offered no proof. Suggesting a double standard, Conway said on NBCs Meet the Press that if Clinton had won the election and Trump supporters had protested, people would be freaking out that his supporters were not accepting election results. Its time really for President Obama and Secretary Clinton to say to these protesters: This man is our president, she said. Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan told CNN on Sunday that protests were protected by the First Amendment as long as they were peaceful.  Neither Obama nor Clinton has called for an end to the protests. Obama told Trump at the White House on Thursday that he was going to help Trump succeed, because if you succeed, then the country succeeds. Clinton told supporters at a New York hotel on Wednesday: Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. Trump on Sunday attacked the New York Times for coverage he said was very poor and highly inaccurate.  The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it? Trump wrote on Twitter. The newspaper published a letter in Sundays editions from publisher Arthur Sulzberger and executive editor Dean Baquet, not apologizing, but thanking readers for their loyalty and asking how news outlets underestimated Trumps support. The Times plans to hold power to account, impartially and unflinchingly during the Trump presidency, they wrote. ",politicsNews,"November 12, 2016 ",1

For-profit colleges could prosper under Trump: Barron's,"(Reuters) - For-profit education stocks have surged on expectations that President-elect Donald Trump and a Republican Congress may ease regulations imposed on the industry by the Obama administration, Barrons said in a report. Stocks such as Grand Canyon Education, DeVry Education Group and Capella Education rose about 14 percent last week. Trump won an upset victory in Tuesdays presidential election.  Jeff Silber at BMO Capital Markets said Trumps election could be good news for for-profit education companies, according to Barrons. A federal court trial in San Diego is set to begin on Nov. 28 over claims by former students of now-defunct Trump University that they were defrauded by a series of real estate seminars. A Trump lawyer has requested that the trial be delayed until after Trumps inauguration on Jan. 20. Trump denies the students allegations.  ",politicsNews,"November 13, 2016 ",1
Zuckerberg again rejects claims of Facebook impact on U.S. election,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facebook Inc chief executive Mark Zuckerberg again rejected the idea that the social network affected the U.S. presidential election, saying late Saturday it is extremely unlikely news hoaxes changed the outcome. Ensnared in a string of content controversies in recent months, Facebook has insisted that it is a technology company, not a media firm. But scrutiny of the site has heightened since the surprise election of Republican Donald Trump on Tuesday, with critics alleging the site helped spread lies via fake news stories and hoaxes.  Zuckerberg has vehemently defended the network against such criticism, calling the idea that Facebook affected the election  crazy at a conference on Thursday. He echoed that stance in his late Saturday post, though he said the company would do more to prevent fake news.  Such hoaxes represent a sliver of content shared on Facebook and because they are not limited to partisan views or politics, it is unlikely they could have changed the elections outcome, Zuckerberg said. Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic, he said, noting the networks goal is to give every person a voice. Still, Facebook has launched work to enable people to flag hoaxes and fake news, the statement said. Facebook has faced a number of content controversies this year, including international outcry after it removed an iconic Vietnam War photo due to nudity, a decision that was later reversed. The thorniest content issues are decided by a group of top executives at Facebook. Questions over content policing have returned to the fore in the tense days since the election, which has led to protests against Trump and his proposed policies in major U.S. cities. Ahead of the Nov. 8 election, Facebook users saw fake news reports erroneously alleging that Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump and that a federal agent who had been investigating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was found dead. Senior management have launched a conversation to examine Facebooks involvement in affecting opinions and votes, The New York Times reported on Saturday, saying a group of vice presidents and executives began discussing late Tuesday the companys role in the elections outcome.  Facebooks policy team was called together and the firm plans to address staff concerns at a broader meeting, the paper reported, citing anonymous sources.  Facebook representatives were not immediately available to comment on the report. After the election, many people are asking whether fake news contributed to the result, and what our responsibility is to prevent fake news from spreading, Zuckerberg said on Saturday.  These are very important questions and I care deeply about getting them right. ",politicsNews,"November 13, 2016 ",1
Trump University asks for trial delay until after inauguration,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has requested that a trial over a lawsuit by former students of his now-defunct Trump University be put on hold until after the presidential inauguration, according to a motion filed by his lawyer late Saturday. A trial in federal court in San Diego over former Trump University students claims that they were defrauded by a series of real-estate seminars is scheduled to begin on Nov. 28, but Trump lawyer Daniel Petrocelli said the president-elect needs to devote all of his time and attention to the transition process. Trump is due to assume office on Jan. 20, 2017.  The 69 days until inauguration are critical and all-consuming, Petrocelli said in the filing, arguing that the president-elect should not be required to stand trial during that time. Petrocelli had said at a hearing in San Diego on Thursday that he would request the delay, though U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is overseeing the lawsuit, told lawyers he was not inclined to put off the six-year-old case further and encouraged the parties to settle. The lawsuit involves students who claim they were lured by false promises to pay up to $35,000 to learn Trumps real estate investing secrets from his hand-picked instructors. Trump owned 92 percent of Trump University and had control over all major decisions, the students court papers say. The president-elect denies the allegations and has argued that he relied on others to manage the business.  Curiel also tentatively rejected last week a bid by the president-elect to keep a wide range of statements from the presidential campaign, which included attacks against Curiel himself, out of the fraud trial.  Trump attacked the judge as biased against him. He claimed Curiel, who was born in Indiana but is of Mexican descent, could not be impartial because of Trumps election campaign pledge to build a wall between the United States and Mexico.  Trumps lawyers have argued that Curiel should bar from the trial accusations about Trumps personal conduct including alleged sexual misconduct, his taxes and corporate bankruptcies, along with speeches and tweets. Curiel is presiding over two cases against Trump and the university. A separate lawsuit by New Yorks attorney general is pending. While presidents enjoy immunity from lawsuits arising from their official duties, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that this shield does not extend to acts alleged to have taken place prior to taking office.

Clinton blames FBI's Comey for her defeat in call with donors,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton blamed FBI director James Comey for her stunning defeat in Tuesdays presidential election in a conference call with her top campaign funders on Saturday, according to two participants who were on the call.  Clinton was projected by nearly every national public opinion poll as the heavy favorite going into Tuesdays race. Instead, Republican Donald Trump won the election, shocking many throughout the nation and prompting widespread protests. Clinton has kept a low profile since her defeat after delivering her concession speech on Wednesday morning.  Clinton told her supporters on Saturday that her team had drafted a memo that looked at the changing opinion polls leading up to the election and that the letter from Comey proved to be a turning point. She said Comeys decision to go public with the renewed examination of her email server had caused an erosion of support in the upper Midwest, according to three people familiar with the call. Clinton lost in Wisconsin, the first time since 1984 that the state favored the Republican candidate in a presidential election. Although the final result in Michigan has still not been tallied, it is leaning Republican, in a state that last favored the Republican nominee in 1988. Comey sent a letter to Congress only days before the election announcing that he was reinstating an investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information when she used a private email server while secretary of state from 2009 to 2012.  Comey announced a week later that he had reviewed emails and continued to believe she should not be prosecuted, but the political damage was already done. Clinton told donors that Trump was able to seize on both of Comeys announcements and use them to attack her, according to two participants on the call. While the second letter cleared her of wrongdoing, Clinton said that it reinforced to Trumps supporters that the system was rigged in her favor and motivated them to mobilize on Election Day. The memo prepared by Clintons campaign, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, said voters who decided which candidate to support in the last week were more likely to support Trump than Clinton. In the end, late breaking developments in the race proved one hurdle too many for us to overcome, the memo concludes. A spokesperson for the FBI could not immediately be reached for comment. On the phone call, Dennis Chang, who served as Clintons finance chair, said her campaign and the national party had raised more than $900 million from more than 3 million individual donors, according to the two participants who spoke to Reuters. As Clinton gave her account to donors, Trump hunkered down at Trump Tower with members of the transition team announced on Friday and tasked with selecting the 15 Cabinet posts and thousands of political appointment jobs. Kellyanne Conway, who served as his campaign manager, said on Saturday that the an announcement of a new chief of staff is imminent. Two candidates whose names have surfaced as contenders for the top White House job are campaign CEO Steve Bannon and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. Trump will deliver a speech about his plans moving forward in the coming days and may undertake a national victory tour, Conway said, without providing further details. He will be sworn in on January 20. The president-elect plans to keep his communication channels open. In an interview with CBS 60 Minutes that will air on Sunday, Trump said he isnt ready to give up his Twitter account, where he routinely posted controversial statements during the campaign that unleashed harsh criticism.  Im going to be very restrained, if I use it at all, Im going to be very restrained, Trump said.  ",politicsNews,"November 12, 2016 ",1
Britain's Brexit firebrand Farage meets Trump in New York,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Leading Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage visited Donald Trump at his home on Saturday, after suggesting he could act as a go-between to help smooth British relations with the U.S. president-elect. British Prime Minister Theresa May is not expected to meet the incoming leader until early next year and Farage has suggested her criticisms of Trump in the early days of the campaign could damage ties with Washington.     Were just tourists! Farage, head of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), told reporters as he waited for an elevator to take him up to the meeting at Trump Tower in New York City. He later tweeted a photograph of himself with Trump standing in front of a pair of golden doors and smiling broadly, the president-elect giving the camera a thumbs-up. It was a great honor to spend time with @realDonaldTrump, Farage tweeted. He was relaxed and full of good ideas. Im confident he will be a good President.     Trumps election campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said: I think they enjoy each others company, and they actually had a chance to talk about freedom and winning and what this all means for the world.  In a separate photograph posted on Twitter, UKIP donor Arron Banks, Breitbart London Editor in Chief Raheem Kassam, and Gerry Gunster, an American whose advocacy firm worked on the Brexit campaign, were also pictured with Trump and Farage.  May - who spoke to Trump by phone on Thursday - and her predecessor David Cameron last year described Trump as divisive and wrong over his call to ban Muslims from entering the United States. At that time he was not considered likely to win the presidency. In a leaked diplomatic telegram, sent on Nov. 9 and printed in the Sunday Times newspaper, Britains ambassador to Washington, Kim Darroch, said he believed Britain had built better relationships with Trumps team than other foreign diplomats. (Trump) is above all an outsider and an unknown quantity, whose campaign pronouncements may reveal his instincts, but will surely evolve and, particularly, be open to outside influence if pitched right, he said. We should be well placed to do this. While the British government has congratulated Trump on his election, the head of the opposition, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, said he should grow up on the immigration issue and recognize that the U.S. economy depends on migrant workers.  The treatment of Mexico by the United States, just as much as its absurd and abusive language towards Muslims, is something that has to be challenged and should be challenged, Corbyn, whose wife is Mexican, told the BBC on Sunday. UKIP, which has only one member of parliament in London, said Farage and Trump spent more than an hour discussing Trumps victory, global politics and Brexit. A UKIP official has suggested Farage could even be the next ambassador to the United States, but British media reported that Mays office rejected the idea of any role for Farage, citing unnamed sources who described him as an irrelevance. A day after Trumps election victory, Farage called on the real estate mogul to reverse loathsome Barack Obamas policy by making Britain his top priority.  Farage said he had been pleased at Trumps very positive reaction to the idea that a bust of former British prime minister Winston Churchill be put back in the Oval Office. He has also joked about sexual assault allegations against Trump, urging him to schmooze May but not touch her. He proposed that in any meetings between the British and American leaders, he could attend to be the responsible adult to make sure everything is OK.     Farage, who spoke at a Trump rally during the election campaign, had predicted the former reality TV host would tap into the same dissatisfaction among voters that led to Britain deciding on June 23 to leave the European Union. Trump made repeated references to Brexit during his campaign, saying it had highlighted the desire for change among voters frustrated with traditional politics.

Obama officials work against time to wrap banking rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials are striving to put finishing touches on a slew of banking rules before President Barack Obama leaves office and hands regulatory power to Donald Trump who has vowed to rewrite the existing financial rule book. President-elect Trump will take over on Jan. 20 and his fellow Republicans will have control of Congress and government agencies, allowing the new administration to block or roll back many of the last-minute changes. But by completing far-advanced work on some banking standards in the next 10 weeks, Obama officials would raising the chances that some elements of the regulatory framework will survive. Some rules are meant to flesh out the Dodd Frank Act of 2010 designed to prevent the next global financial crisis. Trump campaigned on a pledge to scrap the law but now he says only some provisions must go to lighten the regulatory burden. The Federal Reserve is working on rules to govern matters such as executive pay, market stability and what investments Wall Street may hold. Last month, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White said her agency would in the near term finish a rule on one thorny issue: how mutual funds manage derivatives. The SEC and bank regulators have also for years struggled to finalize a rule that would tie more banker pay to the long-term health of their firms rather than short-term performance of Wall Street firms. With only about 40 working days until the handover, it is not clear which, if any, of those standards will get across the finishing line. Just look at the calendar, said Tom Quaadman of the Chamber of Commerce. These are intricate rules and theres not much time. The executive pay rule exemplifies the challenge. Six federal agencies have a say on the compensation standard meant as part of Dodd Frank and a final draft has not yet been offered, industry officials told Reuters. It would be nearly impossible to circulate a final rule and get the agencies to endorse it while still satisfying standards for clearing such paperwork, several lobbyists who have opposed the rule said. Banking regulators declined to comment on when the compensation rule might be completed. Simple logistics also pose a challenge. New federal rules come into force once they have been published in the Federal Register and employees there typically need several days to typeset a rule. That means Obama officials need to lodge paperwork with the Federal Register at the beginning of the inauguration week at the latest. Some sixteen copy editors are due to forego leave and be on hand in the coming weeks to process final rules expected from dozens of agencies, said an official familiar with the operation, but not authorized to speak to the media. These days, people do not spend a lot of time hanging around the coffee maker, he said. Some freshly-minted rules also face the prospect of getting erased under a 1996 law known as the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to block a regulation within 60 working days of being drafted. One such rule allows students who were defrauded by for-profit colleges to seek loan forgiveness. The Department of Education finalized it days before the Nov. 8 election, meaning Republicans who have raised objections to it will have a chance to block it. President George W. Bush was the first to trigger the Review Act when he block labor regulations that his predecessor Bill Clinton had enacted at the end of his term. ",politicsNews,"November 13, 2016 ",1
U.S. to push ahead on climate pact before Trump takes over: Kerry,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday the Obama administration would do everything it could to implement a global agreement to combat climate change before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Kerry made the comments during a visit to New Zealand just before setting off to Marrakesh, Morocco to take part in climate talks between 200 nations. Donald Trump, who calls global warming a hoax and has promised to quit the Paris Agreement, was considering ways to bypass a theoretical four-year procedure for leaving the accord, according to a source on Trumps transition team. Kerry declined to speculate on what Trump might do about the Paris Agreement and noted that there was sometimes a difference between campaigning and governing.  But the top American diplomat was clear he thought further action to prevent climate change should be a priority. The evidence is mounting in ways that people in public life should not dare to avoid accepting as a mandate for action, Kerry told journalists at a press conference in Wellington with New Zealand Prime Minister John Key Until January 20 when this administration is over, we intend to do everything possible to meet our responsibility to future generations to be able to address this threat to life itself on the planet. Kerrys visit to Wellington followed a two-day trip to Antarctica where he flew in a helicopter over the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which would add to rising sea levels if it melts, and spoke to scientists researching how fast climate change is likely to occur. The U.S. accounts for just under 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions so is considered a key player in the Paris Agreement, which has been ratified by 109 countries so far. The accord seeks to limit rising temperatures that have been linked to increasing economic damage from desertification, extinctions of animals and plants, heat waves, floods and rising sea levels.

Abe aims to underscore importance of Japan-U.S. alliance with Trump,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe aims to underscore the importance of the Japan-U.S. alliance when he meets President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday, Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said on Sunday. This is going to be an important meeting to build trust, Kishida told public broadcaster NHK. We also would like to use this opportunity to input the importance of the Japan-U.S. alliance, as well. With Abe set to meet Trump in New York on his way to an Asia-Pacific summit in Peru, Tokyo has been seeking clarity on what direction the Republican political novice wants for bilateral relations after he made comments on the campaign trail that were at odds with longstanding policies. Kishida reiterated Japans long-standing position that it has no plans to possess nuclear weapons. During his campaign, Trump left open the possibility that Japan - the only country to have suffered a nuclear bombing - might adopt nuclear weapons. I dont believe Japan will possess nuclear arms. This principle wont change, Kishida said. Trumps campaign comments on Japans nuclear armament and his demand that Japan pay more for the upkeep of U.S. forces on its soil have worried Tokyo about a possible rift in a security alliance with Washington that has been the bedrock of its defense since World War Two. Defence Minister Tomomi Inada told the same NHK program that Japan is already shouldering enough financial burden to support U.S. troops deployed in Japan.  Japan is making sufficient contribution, she said. I would like to continue underscoring that Japan is going to strengthen its own defense posture both in quality and quantity, strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance and strengthen ties with other relevant countries.

Turkey issues warning over travel to U.S. after Trump protests,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey warned its citizens about travel to the United States on Saturday in response to what the foreign ministry called increasingly violent protests against President-elect Donald Trump. Within the context of risks caused by the incidents and of social tension, our citizens who live in the U.S., or who are considering traveling there, should be cautious, the ministry said in a statement. Demonstrators planned to gather again on Saturday in U.S. cities nationwide to protest against Trump, whose election they say poses a threat to their civil and human rights, a day after a protester was shot in Portland, Oregon. Last month, the U.S. State Department updated its travel warning on Turkey, ordering family members of consulate employees in Istanbul to leave the country, citing threats against U.S. citizens. There has been growing tension between the two NATO allies after repeated calls from Turkey to extradite U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara blames for a failed coup in July. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said on Wednesday he hoped for an improvement in bilateral ties after Trumps victory, and again called for Gulens extradition.

Some Republicans see attacking Obamacare through regulation,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Republicans are looking for the quickest ways to tear down Obamacare following Donald Trumps election as U.S. president, including rapidly confirming a new health secretary who could recast regulations while waiting for lawmakers to pass sweeping repeal legislation. Trumps victory on Tuesday means Republicans will control the White House, Senate and House of Representatives. But congressional Democrats are expected to put up a huge fight against Republican efforts to repeal the 2010 law considered President Barack Obamas signature domestic policy achievement. The Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, has provided 25 million previously uninsured Americans with health coverage. Republicans have launched repeated legal and legislative efforts to dismantle the law, which they call a government overreach. Wyoming Senator John Barrasso, a member of Senate Republican leadership, said one way for the incoming president and Congress to attack Obamacare immediately after Trump takes office on Jan. 20 would be to quickly confirm a new secretary of Health and Human Services, the official who writes the rules and regulations that enforce the law. We could confirm someone on Jan. 20 who could come in immediately and could be working right now on rewriting rules and regulations to give more freedom and choice to the states, to insurance companies and to businesses that are trying to provide affordable care to their workers, Barrasso said in a telephone interview. Barrasso noted that the Senate needs only a simple majority vote in the 100-seat chamber to confirm Cabinet members, as opposed to 60 votes to overcome procedural hurdles the Democrats could present to repeal legislation. Passing repeal legislation is not a Day One activity. But a new secretary of HHS going after the regulations can be a Day One activity, Barrasso added. Trump during the campaign called Obamacare a disaster and joined fellow Republicans in vowing to repeal and replace it with proposals like tax-free health savings accounts. His transition website says Trump wants a solution that returns the historic role in regulating health insurance to the states. In repealing Obamacare, congressional Republican may have to resort to a special procedure known as reconciliation to get around Democrats in the Senate, where rules protect the rights of the minority party. Republicans in Congress used reconciliation to try to undo large chunks of Obamacare in January, but Obama vetoed the legislation. The bill would have wiped out tax subsidies provided to help people afford insurance coverage, as well as tax penalties on people who do not obtain insurance as required by the law, and would have eliminated expansion of the Medicaid insurance health insurance program.  Republican Representative Chris Collins of New York, one of Trumps earliest supporters on Capitol Hill, said he hopes Congress can pass a similar bill gutting Obamacare within Trumps first 100 days in office, a promise Trump made during the presidential campaign. But some changes will doubtless be phased in over time, Collins said. Theres nothing that we will be able to do or would want to do that would impact anyones health insurance plan for 2017, Collins said in an interview. From a replacement standpoint, our position has always been as Republicans to move forward in astep-by-step fashion, Barrasso said. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Friday, Trump said he was considering retaining parts of Obamacare including provisions letting parents keep adult children up to age 26 on their insurance policies and barring insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions. While waiting for Congress to act on legislation, the new HHS secretary could be reworking Obamacare regulations, Barrasso said. For example, regulations could give U.S. states more flexibility under a provision that lets states seek waivers from key provisions of the law, such as exemptions from the so-called individual mandate requiring Americans to obtain insurance and the employer mandate to provide it. Kim Monk, an analyst at Capital Alpha Partners, which provides policy research to financial institutions, said Trumps HHS might be able to tighten up the rules governing special enrollment periods for Obamacare. Insurers complain that these periods have allowed some people who initially skipped buying insurance to sign up after becoming ill. HHS might also be able to alter the language on essential benefits that the law requires insurance plans to cover, which include trips to the emergency room, maternity and newborn care, and mental health services, Monk said. The law requires they have to cover 10 essential health benefit categories, but how that gets defined, a lot of that is interpretative, Monk said. And of course, everything the Obama administration interpreted was more, more, more, more expensive coverage, and all these things lead to premium increases. Collins, a member of the Trump transition teams executive committee, said the job of HHS secretary or surgeon general would be great for Ben Carson, referring to the neurosurgeon who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination and later endorsed Trump.

"Trump threat fires up U.S. climate activists, draws in more","(Reuters) - Seattle financial worker Harrison Karlewicz had been considering joining an environmental activist group for a while. The day after Donald Trump won the White House, he signed up. That was a big push for me, kind of a wakeup call, the 25-year-old said, after joining 350 Seattle, a group that stages mass protests against fossil fuel use. I thought, I dont feel involved. I want to get out there. During his campaign, Trump said global warming was a hoax and called for the Environmental Protection Agency to be gutted. He promised to cancel the Paris climate agreement between the United States and nearly 200 other countries to slow climate change, and he pledged to revive the coal industry. Karlewicz represents what environmental activists say is the silver lining of Trumps electoral victory: Environmentally minded people angered by the outcome are rallying to their cause. At 350 Seattle, people packed a volunteer drop-in meeting  after news of Trumps confirmed win, said organizer Emily Johnston. The group blocked a rail line in Washington state that transports oil to Shell and Tesoro refineries earlier this year.  This was surprising to me, because I personally was so shaken that I felt practically paralyzed, and I know many other people did, too, Johnston said. The fact that many others responded by immediately engaging is incredibly heartening. Jay OHara, a Vermont-based climate-change activist with the Climate Disobedience Center and a mastermind behind a coal shipment blockade in 2013 that spurred more radical fossil fuel activism, said Trumps win represents an opportunity for environmentalists to focus on a clear enemy. In some ways, it can almost be seen as a relief, he said of Trumps win. We are going to have a real fight here, or maybe an actual argument. Johnston, of 350 Seattle, who camped for a week at North Dakotas Standing Rock Sioux reservation to protest pipeline construction, said that protesters would continue to take advantage of the vulnerability of energy infrastructure. All these pipelines, all these tankers, all these trains have to go through thousands of miles and could be potential protest targets, she said. Some of the well established national environmental organizations that helped draft the Obama administrations environmental initiatives, like the Clean Power Plan to curb carbon dioxide emissions, will be shifting to a defensive posture under Trumps leadership. Well be in the Congress, in the courts, in the boardrooms and in the streets, said Gene Karpinski, president of the Washington-based League of Conservation Voters, which backed Trumps Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and spent over $45 million to support candidates in the 2016 elections. Karpinski said he expected legal action to prevent Trump from following through on his agenda.  Trump has appointed Myron Ebell, a known climate skeptic, to guide the reshaping of the EPA, and Trump energy adviser Kevin Cramer, a U.S. representative from North Dakota, said Trump is likely to target the Clean Power Plan and Waters of the United States rules during his first 100 days in office. Dan Farber, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, said the best that advocates for climate change action could hope for from  courts is to play successful defense against an anti-environmental onslaught from the new administration.  Its a fairly grim situation, he added. Several groups also said they would put a greater focus on state-level environmental initiatives to sidestep Trumps administration.  The Sierra Club, which is headquartered in California, said it would push ahead with its Beyond Coal campaign, which has led to the retirement of hundreds of coal plants since it was launched more than a decade ago. The campaign mobilizes local activists and lawyers to push utilities and state regulators to shutter older plants and replace them with renewable energy.  Clearly, we are going to have to fight and resist the worst impulses of the next administration, said Michael Brune, Sierra Clubs executive director. But we are also mindful that despite all odds, we were able to make great progress during the Bush administration and we hope to do it again. ",politicsNews,"November 11, 2016 ",1
"Anti-Trump protesters gather for third night, one shot in Portland","MIAMI (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters took their frustrations over Donald Trumps election as the next U.S. president onto the streets on Friday and into Saturday in several cities, including Portland, Oregon, where one protester was shot. The unidentified man was wounded on Portlands Morrison Bridge at 12:45 a.m. local time as he and dozens of other protesters crossed it during their demonstration, one of several across the country denouncing Trumps campaign rhetoric about immigrants, Muslims and women. In the Portland incident, police said in a statement that a man got out of a vehicle on the bridge where he confronted and then shot a protester, who was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries. The suspect is still at large, police added. Earlier in the night, protesters blocked traffic and threw objects at Portland police dressed in riot gear who responded with pepper spray and flash-bang devices. At one point, police pushed protesters back and appeared to take at least one person into custody, according to footage on a local NBC affiliate.  Hundreds of protesters also marched through the streets of Los Angeles, blocking traffic as they waved signs in opposition of Trump and chanted We reject the president elect and Whose streets? Our Streets.  Several thousand activists marched through downtown Miami, with a few hundred making their way onto a highway, halting traffic in both directions. In New York, demonstrators again gathered in Washington Square Park and by Trump Tower, where the Republican president-elect lives, on Fifth Avenue. Trump, who initially denounced Americans who protested against his election, saying they had been incited by the media, reversed course and praised them on Friday. Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud! Trump said on Twitter. The tweets were further evidence of Trumps mixed messages since he announced his candidacy 17 months ago. After Democrat Hillary Clinton conceded defeat early on Wednesday, he took a far more conciliatory tone than he had often displayed during his campaign and promised to be a president for all Americans.  Anti-Trump demonstrators have voiced concerns that his presidency, due to start on Jan. 20, would infringe on Americans civil and human rights.  They cited his campaign promises to restrict immigration and register Muslims, as well as allegations the former reality-TV star sexually abused women. Protesters in various cities have chanted slogans, including No hate! No fear! Immigrants are welcome here! and carried signs reading Impeach Trump. White supremacist groups including the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) have praised Trumps election, and some civil rights advocacy groups have reported a spike of attacks on minorities following Trumps victory on Tuesday. Trump has rejected the KKKs support. Most of the protests across the country, which have also taken place in Washington, D.C., have been largely comprised of young adults and college students. With the country evenly divided, many voters were shocked by the result given that opinion polls failed to predict Trumps triumph. The Republican Party also managed to maintain its majorities in both houses of Congress in Tuesdays vote. More anti-Trump demonstrations were planned for the weekend, including in New York and Los Angeles. A group calling itself #NotMyPresident has scheduled an anti-Trump rally for Washington on Jan. 20, Inauguration Day, when the New York real-estate developer formally succeeds President Barack Obama. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus acknowledged on Friday the tight race with Clinton, but said anti-Trump protesters have to accept the election results. He pointed to Trumps call for unity and meetings on Thursday with Obama and Republican leaders as reasons for reassurance. Security barricades now shield some of Trumps most visible properties, including the newly opened Trump International Hotel near the White House and Trump Tower in New York. Trumps base of support in the election was the broad middle of the country, with voters in states that had long supported Democrats shifting to him after he promised to renegotiate trade deals with other countries.

Trump packs transition team with loyalists and family,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump began laying the groundwork on Friday to take office on Jan. 20, 2017, gathering the most loyal advisers from his insurgent campaign and three of his children to plot his transition strategy. Trump put Vice President-elect Mike Pence in charge of his White House transition team, while demoting his former transition chief, tarnished New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, to one of the six vice-chair posts.  Daughter Ivanka and sons Eric and Donald Jr. and son-in-law Jared Kushner accounted for a fourth of the 16-member executive committee, which was filled with politicians and advisers who stuck with Trump during his rollercoaster first run for public office.  Aides huddled in the real-estate moguls Trump Tower in New York City to begin prioritizing policy changes and considering Cabinet picks and other candidates for the 4,000 positions he will need to fill shortly after he takes the reins of the White House. A member of the Trump transition team told Reuters there were more than 100 people now involved in developing white papers on what regulations to roll back after Jan. 20. Some environmental measures and a rule requiring retirement advisers to act in their clients interests could be among the first on the chopping block, an industry lobbying source said. Trump promised during his campaign to cut taxes, clamp down on immigration and repeal President Barack Obamas signature Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.  But in interviews with the Wall Street Journal and CBS 60 Minutes on Friday, he said he was open to keeping some provisions of Obamacare. James Woolsey, a former CIA director who has advised Trump on foreign policy, said several of Trumps campaign promises were advocacy of a general direction that may require compromise - including his signature pledge to build a wall on the border with Mexico. Woolsey told CNN that border security could be achieved with a combination of fence and wall. I dont think we ought to fall on our sword about the difference between a wall and fence. Maybe this will be cheaper because its mainly fence, but its a good fence. I wouldnt have any problem with that myself, he said. Trump, a billionaire real estate magnate, also moved on Friday to extricate himself from his sprawling business empire, which will be overseen by his three grown children on the transition team.  His company said it was vetting new business structures for the transfer of control to the three and the arrangement would not violate conflict-of-interest laws. But government ethics experts said the move would fall short of blind trust standards and was unlikely to prevent potential conflicts of interest. Trump said that Pence - who has strong ties to Republican leaders in Congress - will build on work done by Christie and has the mission of assembling the most highly qualified group of successful leaders who will be able to implement our change agenda in Washington.  Christie, once viewed as a top candidate for attorney general, is dealing with political fallout from the Bridgegate lane closure scandal. Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani is now the leading contender for the top law enforcement job, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.   Trumps campaign spent relatively little time on transition planning during the campaign, and even his Republican supporters had been bracing for a loss to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in Tuesdays election. I was on Romneys transition team, and it was a well-oiled machine months before the election. Now theres a scramble, said one Republican source, referring to the partys 2012 presidential nominee, Mitt Romney. Since Tuesday, dozens of possible cabinet appointees have been floated, from grassroots conservative heroes like Sarah Palin to seasoned Washington hands like David Malpass. During his campaign, many establishment Republicans condemned Trumps racially inflammatory rhetoric as well as his attacks on trade deals and the NATO alliance, which could take many traditional names out of the running. But outgoing Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte - who had distanced herself from Trump at points in her unsuccessful reelection campaign in New Hampshire - was being floated as a potential defense secretary on Friday, the Washington Post reported. Trumps relatively small cadre of steadfast supporters is expected to play a prominent role in his administration. Campaign sources say Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions could serve as Defense Secretary, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich might be named as Secretary of State and retired General Michael Flynn could serve as national security adviser.  Those three, along with Giuliani and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, were named as vice chairs of the transition team. Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus is a strong candidate for White House chief of staff, according to sources close to the campaign. Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon, a conservative provocateur, is also being considered for the job. As Trump mulled his team, demonstrators hit the streets in major cities for the third straight night to denounce his election and the inflammatory campaign rhetoric on immigrants, Muslims and women. Thousands marched through Miami, Atlanta, Philadelphia, New York and San Francisco as night fell. Trump appears to be leaning toward seasoned Republicans for many economic positions. David Malpass, a former Treasury and State Department official, and Paul Atkins, a former Securities and Exchange Commission official, are guiding the transition team on economic issues. This is one area where the most Republican orthodoxy will come out, said Brandon Barford, a former Republican congressional staffer. The Trump transition website, www.greatagain.gov, picked up on the tone of legislation aimed at weakening Dodd-Frank financial regulations that was released this summer by Republican chair of the House Financial Services Committee, Jeb Hensarling. Trumps victory is forcing President Barack Obama to scale back his ambitions for his final months in office. Obama, who is set to meet with key allies from Europe and Asia next week during his final foreign trip, is giving up on a last-ditch attempt to seek congressional approval for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal before leaving office. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a TPP partner, is slated to meet with Trump next week in New York, and the president-elect also fielded calls from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande on Friday. But EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had a blunter reaction to the Trump transition. I think we will waste two years before Mr. Trump tours the world he does not know, Juncker said on Friday. ",politicsNews,"November 11, 2016 ",1
Anti-Trump protest leaders say preparing for long fight,"BOSTON (Reuters) - The protests in major U.S. cities against Republican Donald Trumps surprise presidential election victory have been impromptu affairs, quickly organized by young Americans with a diverse array of backgrounds and agendas. But as they look out at the next four years with Trump in the White House while his party controls both houses of Congress, activists are starting to prepare for what they hope will be the nations strongest protests since the Occupy Wall Street movement. Rallies scheduled for Saturday in New York and Los Angeles, and a protest planned for Washington on Jan. 20, when the New York businessman succeeds President Barack Obama, will be just the beginning, activists said in a series of interviews. The Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights leader from New York, said anti-Trump protesters should borrow a page from the playbook that Republicans used to oppose Obamas policies. That movement started organically, later developed as the Tea Party movement and eventually resulted in the election of Trump, said Sharpton, whose National Action Network plans to launch a new organizing effort at its New York headquarters on Saturday. We are not going to be as ugly as them, but we are going to be just as persistent, Sharpton said. This is not going away.  Sizable protests sprung up this week in about a dozen major U.S. cities, including Boston, Baltimore and San Francisco. Demonstrations in Portland, Oregon, and Berkeley, California, turned violent, with protesters setting fires and clashing with police. Trump initially dismissed the crowds on Twitter, calling them professional protesters, incited by the media, but later reversed course, saying he admired their passion. T.J. Wells, who had volunteered to work for Democrat Hillary Clintons failed presidential campaign, said his decision to organize a Thursday night protest at Washingtons Trump International Hotel near the White House was spontaneous. I literally shared it with a few friends, and within a few hours I had a couple hundred people show up, said Wells, who is 27 and lives in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, Maryland, where he works in human resources. He said he hoped it would be the first of many such demonstrations. From Inauguration Day to the time hes out of office, we have to make sure that if theres something hes going to pass that the majority of Americans who voted for Hillary Clinton are not OK with, that we are forceful about that, Wells said. Some 59.5 million people voted for Trump, fewer than the 59.7 million who cast ballots for Clinton, but Trumps strong showing in swing states, including Michigan, earned him a decisive victory in the Electoral College that ultimately picks the president. Opponents have cited Trumps history as a leader of the birther movement that claimed wrongly that Obama had not been born in the United States, his promises to deport the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country and his calls to register Muslims. Members of the ANSWER Coalition, a broad-based U.S. protest group, have marched in this weeks protests and aim to draw tens of thousands to an anti-Trump Inauguration Day rally, said Walter Smolarek, an organizer. The people are going to fight back against the Trump agenda from day one, Smolarek said. He said the group planned to continue to protest throughout Trumps four-year term. Since his victory on Tuesday, Trump has taken a more measured public tone than he had during the campaign. That has some civil-rights advocates ready to wait and see what Trump does before joining in protests. I dont think that Donald Trump responds very well to protests, to be honest with you, said Brent Wilkes, national executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens.  He said he was willing to see whether Trump would be more moderate in his actions than he had been in the campaign, adding: If he doesnt, well be out there in the streets.

Trump considering outgoing Senator Ayotte for defense secretary: Washington Post,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is considering outgoing Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire for the post of defense secretary, the Washington Post reported on Friday, citing two sources familiar with the discussions.

Obama administration suspends Pacific trade deal vote effort,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obamas administration has suspended its  efforts to win congressional approval for his Asian free-trade deal before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, saying on Friday that TPPs fate was up to Trump and Republican lawmakers. Administration officials also said Obama would try to explain the situation to leaders of the 11 other countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact next week when he attends a regional summit in Peru.   Obamas cabinet secretaries and the U.S. Trade Representatives office had been lobbying lawmakers for months to pass the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership deal in the post-election, lame-duck session of Congress. However, Trumps stunning election victory that sends him to the White House in January and retains Republican majorities in Congress has stymied those plans. We have worked closely with Congress to resolve outstanding issues and are ready to move forward, but this is a legislative process and its up to congressional leaders as to whether and when this moves forward, USTR spokesman Matt McAlvanah said in a statement. On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would not take up TPP in the weeks before Trumps inauguration and said its fate was now up to Trump. House Speaker Paul Ryan had earlier said he would not proceed with a lame-duck vote.  Trump made his opposition to the TPP a centerpiece of his campaign, calling it a disaster and a rape of our country that would send more jobs overseas. His anti-free-trade message and pledges to stem the tide of imported goods from China and Mexico won him massive support among blue-collar workers in the industrial heartland states of Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, helping to swing the election his way. Trump has said he will scrap TPP, renegotiate the 22-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement and adopt a much tougher trade stance with China. The TPP agreement, negotiated for more than five years and signed in October 2015, was aimed at reducing trade barriers erected by some of the fastest growing economies in Asia and boosting ties with U.S. allies in the region in the face of Chinas rising influence. White House Deputy National Security Advisor Wally Adeyemo told reporters on Friday that Obama will tell TPP member countries at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit that the United States will remain engaged in Asia, and that it recognizes the benefits of trade and such deals still make sense. In terms of the TPP agreement itself, Leader McConnell has spoken to that and its something that hes going to work with the President-elect to figure out where they go in terms of trade agreements in the future, Adeyemo said. But we continue to think that these types of deals make sense, simply because countries like China are not going to stop working on regional agreements. ",politicsNews,"November 11, 2016 ",1
Three Trump children seen managing president-elect's company,"(Reuters) - The Trump Organization said on Friday it was vetting new business structures aimed at transferring management control to three of President-elect Donald Trumps children and a team of executives. The Trump Organization said in a statement it was planning to transfer control of the portfolio of businesses to Donald Trump Jr, Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump and other executives. Earlier on Friday, the three Trump children - the oldest of Trumps five children - were also named as members of Trumps Presidential Transition Team Executive Committee.   This is a top priority at the organization and the structure that is ultimately selected will comply with all applicable rules and regulations, a spokesperson for the Trump Organization said in a statement. Federal conflict-of-interest law does not apply to the president, but most White House occupants in the last few decades have voluntarily placed their assets in a blind trust to avoid any suggestion of impropriety. Experts in government ethics said that giving over control to Trumps children would do virtually nothing to prevent potential conflicts of interest, since theres usually no daylight between ones personal interest and the interest of ones immediate family members. It doesnt meet any of the standards of a blind trust if the kids are running the company, said Kenneth Gross, a Washington lawyer who specializes in advising political clients on compliance and ethics. Gross noted that the official transition team roles that Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump now have would appear to complicate matters further. If theyre going to be involved in government functions -  and theyre starting down that road - and running the business, thats going to make it very difficult to separate the government and business functions and deal with the conflicts of interest, Gross said. All three children already have roles in the Trump Organization, according to the companys website. Ivanka Trump is executive vice president of development and acquisitions, charged with domestic and global expansion of the companys real estate interests. Donald Trump Jr is an executive vice president, and works to expand the companys real estate, retail, commercial, hotel and golf interests nationally and internationally. Eric Trump is executive vice president of development and acquisitions, responsible for new project acquisition, development and construction globally. Typically, a blind trust involves turning over assets to an independent financial manager with no prior relationship to the owner. In addition, a blind trust derives its name from the idea that the owner would no longer know what assets are sold or bought. For instance, someone with extensive stock holdings would have no way of knowing which companies shares he or she still owned in a blind trust. Trumps portfolio includes interests in hundreds of limited liability companies, many overseas, as well as numerous real estate properties both domestic and foreign. Short of selling the entire Trump empire, experts said, he will find it difficult to create a trust sufficiently blind to avoid the possibility of any conflicts. ",politicsNews,"November 11, 2016 ",1
Illinois governor reports $188.1 million in 2015 personal income,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner reported personal income of more than $188.1 million in 2015, and 90 percent of the former private equity investors earnings came from capital gains, according to income tax returns he released on Friday. Rauner, a Republican, and his wife, Diana, paid federal taxes of $51.6 million and $6.9 million in state taxes in 2015. Of the total income, $169.5 million was from capital gains, though no details were released on the source of those profits. I believe as the good book says to whom much has been given from whom much is expected in return, Rauner said at a news conference when asked about his tax returns. Rauner, who has led a fight against Democrats controlling Illinois legislature in the countrys longest-running state fiscal impasse, and his wife contributed $21.7 million individually to various Illinois political campaigns this year to weaken Democratic control of the state legislature and dislodge the states long-running budget stalemate, campaign records show. Illinois has not had a full operating budget for 17 months. Republicans netted four seats in the Illinois House and two seats in the state Senate in Tuesdays elections, but Democrats retained control of both legislative chambers and defeated Rauners choice for comptroller. A separate filing from Rauners familys foundation showed $53.6 million in assets at the end of 2015 and $11.6 million in charitable giving for the year. In 2014, Rauner and his wife reported $58.3 million in earnings. Because the Rauners assets are in a blind trust, an aide said the couple is screened from all financial decisions and cannot explain the increase in their income. A spokesman for Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan  declined comment on the governors earnings, but a top Madigan ally said Rauners wealth puts him out of touch with the electorate. I dont know how he can claim to ever understand the problems of regular, ordinary Illinoisans, said Democratic Representative Lou Lang. Madigan and Democratic Senate President John Cullerton, Chicago attorneys who maintain property-tax appeal practices, do not release their tax returns. ",politicsNews,"November 11, 2016 ",1
Trump says he's considering keeping parts of Obamacare: WSJ,"(Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump told the Wall Street Journal he is considering retaining parts of President Barack Obamas healthcare law including provisions letting parents keep adult children up to age 26 on insurance policies and barring insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. The Republican businessman during the U.S. presidential campaign called for repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and labeled the 2010 law a disaster. In an interview published on Friday, his first since winning Tuesdays election, Trump told the Journal a big reason for his shift was his meeting at the White House on Thursday with Obama, who suggested areas of the Affordable Care Act to preserve. I told him I will look at his suggestions, and out of respect, I will do that, Trump said. Either Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced, Trump told the Journal. Some Republican lawmakers and advisers have recommended keeping those two provisions in place even if they are able to repeal the law in Congress, as they have attempted to do for years. The law has enabled millions of Americans who previously had no health insurance to obtain coverage, but Republicans oppose it and call it a government overreach. Other urgent priorities during his first few weeks as president, Trump said, would be deregulating financial institutions to allow banks to lend again, and securing the U.S. border against drugs and illegal immigrants. Asked whether he would pursue a campaign promise to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate defeated Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton over her use of a private email server while secretary of state, Trump told the paper: Its not something Ive given a lot of thought, because I want to solve healthcare, jobs, border control, tax reform. Trump also told the Journal he would create jobs through infrastructure projects and improved trade deals, and would preserve American jobs by potentially imposing tariffs on the products of U.S. companies that relocated overseas.

Supporters to Trump: break campaign promises at your peril,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Kathryn Stellmack expects the world from Donald Trump. After listening to his speeches and casting her vote for him, she expects Trump to toughen immigration laws, restore lost jobs, upend a corrupt political system, build a wall on the border, and be, as the millionaire put it, the greatest jobs president that God has ever created. We expect him to move forward on all the items he has promised to move forward on, said Stellmack, 69, a retiree in West Palm Beach, Florida. And if he doesnt, we will hold his feet to the fire. After a presidential race fueled by brash but constantly shifting policy proposals, Trumps millions of followers  from social conservative activists to struggling blue-collar workers to hardline militant groups  say if he does anything less than take a wrecking ball to business-as-usual Washington, they will be disappointed. Well be watching, Mr. Trump, said Stellmack. Trumps promises have been hard to pin down, with many policy details left elusive and vague. NBC News identified 141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues since Trump announced his candidacy on June 16, 2015.  Still, his fiery rhetoric had an unmistakable message of ending big government and the entrenched power of establishment elites in both parties. That inspired hope that Trump can break through Washingtons gridlock to make progress on plans to invigorate the economy, eliminate terrorist threats, rip up trade agreements and repeal President Barack Obamas healthcare plan known as Obamacare. I totally trust him, said Laura Czarniak, 56, of Manistee, Michigan, a Rust Belt state that leans Democrat in presidential elections but which flipped to Trump on Tuesday.  I know hell build the wall. I know hell take care of the Syrian refugee problem. I know hell get rid of Obamacare. There is not a chance in hell he wont do those things, she said. But even with Republicans retaining control of Congress, Trump will have to accept limits and compromises on some of his plans. Many Republicans, for example, are wary of his proposals to scrap trade deals and boost spending on infrastructure improvements. Some of his plans have already been rolled back. Trump faces his highest expectations on the issue of immigration, given his intense focus on attention-grabbing campaign proposals like forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall, and temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country. But he recently indicated he would at first deport only criminal undocumented immigrants, after previously pledging to deport all undocumented aliens, while the Muslim ban has softened into extreme vetting of immigrants from some countries. He told the Wall Street Journal in an interview on Friday that he would consider keeping parts of Obamacare intact  easing off his calls for a total repeal  after Obama spoke to him on the issue at the White House on Thursday. Mark Morris, a leader of the Colorado-based Three Percent United Patriots militia group, said he understood Trump would need time on some issues, but he expected quick movement on repealing Obamacare and appointing a conservative Supreme Court justice to fill the seat of the late Antonin Scalia. He said he hoped Trump would stand with ranchers in their disputes with the federal government over fees charged for cattle grazing on public land  a call to arms for many in the patriot and militia movement. Morris warned Trump should not count on his followers to stay with him if he did not produce results. People voted with a lot of faith that he will come through, he said. I dont think it is going to work out very well if he doesnt get the things done and he comes back at the end of four years and says I need four more years to accomplish what I need to accomplish. Trump had to take strong action on immigration given his rhetoric, said Roy Beck, head of Numbers USA, a group that favors reduced immigration levels. He said Numbers USA and other grassroots groups would pressure Trump to keep his promises to bolster enforcement and cut back on legal immigration and foreign workers, including eliminating immigration by low-skill and non-extraordinary-skilled workers. Theres no way he would have been elected president if he had not so boldly made immigration his top issue, Beck said. You have to come through on your top issue. The question is in the details. He said many Trump supporters understood his talk about the border wall was shorthand for restoring the rule of law in immigration, although it was a promise by which he would be judged. Were in the best position weve ever been in since the 1950s to get control of this issue, but we still have big challenges, Beck said. For many activists in the anti-abortion movement who are suspicious Trumps promises are fueled by politics more than conviction, he still has plenty to prove. I think were seeing a mix of emotions, from excitement and some fear to somewhere in between, Jeanne Mancini, president of the anti-abortion group March for Life Education and Defense Fund said of Trumps election. For us the most important thing will be to hold him to his campaign promises, particularly on the Supreme Court. We want to be sure he is true to his word, she said of Trumps vow to appoint justices who will vote to overturn Roe vs Wade, the 1973 decision legalizing abortion. But Trump needs to move quickly, said Thomas Pyle, a Trump supporter and president of the free-market advocacy group American Energy Alliance. Washington is a very, very difficult place to turn the ship. He has a limited window before the culture in Washington seeps in, Pyle said. But if he acts boldly, he can do a lot.

Trump may already have a plan ready to revamp Dodd-Frank,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chair of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, released legislation this summer to weaken the major financial law known as Dodd-Frank, many said it was a prt-a-porter plan that his partys nominee, Donald Trump, could easily adopt. Now that Trump is president-elect, he appears to be doing just that.  Language about financial services posted on the Trump transition website, www.greatagain.gov, echoes the tone of Hensarlings bill, known as the CHOICE Act.  It calls Dodd-Frank, passed in the wake of the 2007-09 financial crisis and recession, as a sprawling and complex piece of legislation that has unleashed hundreds of new rules and several new bureaucratic agencies and promises to dismantle and replace it with new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation. Hensarlings legislation, which his committee approved in September, also takes a replacement approach. The Texas Republican had unveiled his proposal in Trumps hometown of New York in June, and then met with the businessman later in the day. At the same time, Hensarling was mentioned as a possible Treasury secretary by Trumps team. He has said he is  not pursuing a Cabinet position.  The CHOICE Act accurately reflects the priorities that President Trump has placed on the Dodd-Frank problem, said J.W. Verret, an associate professor at the George Mason University Antonin Scalia Law School and financial regulation expert. Verret regularly meets with and briefs members of Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission on financial regulation. I think it is a great blueprint for everything that he has promised, said Verret, a former Republican congressional staffer.  The Hensarling blueprint would primarily allow banks to choose between complying with Dodd-Frank or meeting tougher capital requirements - primarily to maintain a ratio of tangible equity to leverage exposure of 10 percent.  It would also reorganize the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, throw out the Volcker Rule restricting banks from making speculative investments and eliminate the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to designate non-banks as systemically important.  It also differs from the Dodd-Frank legislation in the way it treats insolvent banks. Hensarling says his approach will prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to bail out failed institutions.  Alongside Obamacare, Dodd-Frank is considered one of Democratic President Barack Obamas signature domestic policies. The most senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, Sherrod Brown, has been a vocal defender of it, as has liberal firebrand Senator Elizabeth Warren. That means a Dodd-Frank revamp could stall in one chamber of Congress. Senate rules allow a single member to block a bill from proceeding to a vote. Trump said last May that he would dismantle Dodd-Frank, primarily because the law makes it hard for banks to loan money.  But few have called for total demolition of it, with bank industry sources privately saying they would like to see an easing of Dodd-Frank rules.  Trump campaign adviser Anthony Scaramucci, a Wall Street financier, said this week that the administration will review the law and the worst anti-business parts of it will be gutted. Verret said he believes some components of the CHOICE Act will appeal to the populist anger felt by Tea Party members and Trump supporters toward big banks. One such provision, he said, would place limits on how central banks can lend to financial institutions in times of crisis, an in effort to prevent future bailouts. This kind of reform, he added, appeals to both populists and free market thinkers at the same time. ",politicsNews,"November 11, 2016 ",1
"Scared by Trump, some migrants on Mexico border give up American dream","NOGALES, Mexico (Reuters) - Donald Trumps election victory and his plans to crack down on illegal immigration is so troubling for the groups of men gathered just south of a rusty, towering fence on the U.S.-Mexico border that some are even considering going home. For most poor Central Americans and Mexicans at travelers  shelters in the desert town of Nogales, Trumps threats to build a wall along the whole border and deport millions of illegal immigrants have not made them abandon their harrowing journeys and hopes of a better life in the north.  But for some like Juan Alberto Lopez, the prospect of living in a country they believe will become more hostile to people like them no longer holds enough appeal to make the risky crossing across the desolate Arizona borderland. Now everythings changed, said the despondent Lopez, 25, as he sat staring blankly at the ground in outside one migrant center, under a cobalt sky. Lopez hails from the southern state of Chiapas, Mexicos poorest, and lived for two years in Arizona and Utah working in construction before being deported in January. Under one of Trumps proposals, he would face a two-year federal prison sentence for returning after deportation. He had decided to go back to the United States when Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was projected to win the election. Now, he plans to seek work in Nogales instead, or go home.  Theyre going to detain all the migrants, and if its like that, its better to stay here with your own people, be happy, and just endure it, he added, echoing the sentiments of a third of more than a dozen migrants interviewed by Reuters in Nogales following Trumps victory. In running for president, Trump promised to deport millions of illegal immigrants as well as build a wall along the border to stop others entering the United States, and make Mexico pay for it. His uncompromising stance helped drive a rush over the U.S. border as some migrants calculated it was better to cross over before the election in case Trump won. That could continue in coming months even as some like Lopez decide they no longer want to live in the United States. During fiscal year 2016, which ended in September, the number of people detained along the U.S.-Mexico border surpassed 408,000, a 23 percent jump from last year, although it was less than in 2014, official U.S. data published last month showed. I really dont care about President Trump. Im always going to cross regardless of any walls he wants, said Alexi Solano, 20, a migrant from El Salvador, whose wife and young son are already in Los Angeles. That doesnt matter to us. What we want is to be together with our families. Mexicos deputy interior minister for migration, Humberto Roque Villanueva, said he expected that flow to peak in 2016 as Trump will ramp up already tough deportation policies applied by President Barack Obama. A certain radicalization of the North American immigration policy is coming, Roque Villanueva said. In Nogales, a city of 230,000 dotted with factories of multinational firms like Motorola and B/E Aerospace, migrants say people smugglers typically charge $4,000 per person for a one-way ticket across the border. As with long stretches of the 2,000-mile (3,200-km) border, a 25-foot-tall fence already exists along the international boundary here, built in 2011 and made up of thick rust-colored metal beams that follow the rocky terrain for miles to the west and east of the city.  Beyond the fence on the U.S. side, a parallel set of wooden posts are topped with cameras and sensors. In the distance, U.S. immigration vehicles slowly patrol the border.  Some 25 miles (40 km) to the east of town, the towering fence comes to an end and is replaced with a waist-high barrier that mainly serves to stop trucks plowing through the desert. While some migrants trudge around the barricade, risking weather exposure on foot through rugged terrain menaced by drug cartel thugs and poisonous snakes, others opt to ride hidden in trucks that drive through official crossings, a route made possible, several said, by bribes. Maria Engracia Robles, a Roman Catholic nun who runs El Comedor center for deportees and migrants within sight of the border fence in Nogales, thinks Trumps victory will likely bring more hardship and worries about the challenges that mass deportations would bring.  More anguish, tears, laments, and lots of people in Mexico without work, without anything to do and no place to go, said Robles, whose center provides free meals, clothes and basic medical care. Braced against the dry wind, dozens of hungry migrants line up around El Comedors entrance for breakfast each morning. On Thursday, two men just inside the shelter could be overheard on mobile phones asking for a coyote, or human trafficker, to attempt another crossing. Here there is no work, and salaries are terrible, said Robles.  The U.S.-Mexico border is home to the largest per capita wage differential of any land border on the planet, with average U.S. wages about five times higher than Mexican wages.  Further south, in Central America, incomes are even lower, and crime worse, fueling a surge of migration in recent years. More Central American migrants were apprehended on the U.S. southern border than Mexicans this year.   Jose Flores, 19, a Honduran migrant who set out for the United States three months ago, ticked off the perils posed by violent gangs and dismal job prospects in his home country. I imagine its going to get a lot harder to cross, he said. But what hasnt changed is were looking for a better life.

"In rural-urban divide, U.S. voters are worlds apart","JANESVILLE, Wisc. (Reuters) - Semi-retired Wisconsin pig farmer John Lader does not think much of Donald Trump as a messenger, but voted for what he described as the Republican president-elects message of change and economic hope for America. The last few years, there hasnt been much optimism and hope among working people in rural areas in this country, said Lader, 65, who lives in the farmland outside the southern Wisconsin city of Janesville. Around 65 miles (105 km) to the northeast in the states biggest city of Milwaukee, Jose Boni, who cleans offices at a local university and rents out several homes, heard a different message: Trumps plan to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and vow to deport the estimated 11 million immigrants who are in the United States illegally, most of whom are Hispanic.  He doesnt care about our community or working people, he only cares about himself, said Boni, 57, an Ecuador-born U.S. citizen. The different worlds of Lader and Boni help illustrate the rural-urban divide that was critical to the outcome of Tuesdays U.S. presidential election. A country once defined by regional voting now is more clearly divided by the differences between rural and urban voters. The combination of a strong Trump turnout in the countryside and a weak showing by Democrat Clinton in the cities went a long way toward deciding the election. Rural and small-town working-class white voters, who already tended to vote Republican, propelled Trump. Urban areas, where black and Hispanic voters are concentrated along with college-educated voters, already leaned toward the Democrats, but Clinton did not get the turnout from these groups that she needed. For instance, black voters did not show up in the same numbers they did for Barack Obama, the first black president, in 2008 and 2012. Trump beat Clinton by 26 percentage points among voters who live in non-metropolitan areas, while Clinton bested Trump by about 7 percentage points in urban areas, according to the nationwide Reuters/Ipsos national Election Day poll. Steven Schier, a political science professor at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, said rural voters feel theyve lost something, that America is moving away from them. Trump came up with the perfect slogan for them in Make America Great Again because it hits them exactly where they live,Schier said. Democratic presidential candidates had won in Wisconsin in every election since 1988, until Trumps victory on Tuesday. In Wisconsin, overall turnout was lower than in the 2012 presidential election. Trump actually was a few hundred votes shy of 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romneys total in the state, but Clinton was around 240,000 votes short of Obamas 2012 tally. She ended up around 24,000 votes behind Trump in the state. Those couple hundred thousand Democratic voters for whatever reason decided not to vote, Mordecai Lee, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. They stayed home, and Wisconsin went Republican. I think that was the pattern around the country.  Turnout in Milwaukees Hispanic neighborhoods was down 9 percent versus 2012, while citywide turnout in Milwaukee fell 14 percent.  Clinton took 65.6 percent in Milwaukee County, which includes the city, to Trumps 28.6 percent. But Trump won in rural counties, for example taking 59.9 percent to Clintons 33.6 percent in Fond du Lac County in the middle of the state and 71.4 percent to 25.1 percent in Florence County in the far north. In Milwaukee, Election Day canvassers found Trumps comments about immigrants were not enough to get people to the polls. Christine Neumann-Ortiz, director of community group Voces De La Frontera, said about 15 percent of the voters reached by the group in Milwaukee raised concerns about Clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state or were undecided.  If we reached people, we were able to convince them to vote, but I dont think we could ever have reached enough by ourselves to overcome Trumps advantage with white working-class voters, Neumann-Ortiz said. The rural landscape was rich Trump territory, with people concerned about a slump in commodity prices and layoffs among manufacturers. Rural areas, especially in the Midwest and Northeast, have also seen a demographic shift in recent years with the arrival of Hispanic immigrants. Demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington said census data from 2008 to 2015 showed Hispanic populations in non-metro counties in the Midwest rose 18 percent while the white population fell 9 percent.  The counties still are 84 percent white, but those voters are feeling the change, Frey said. Theyre a little bit fearful of it, and if theyre being hit hard economically, that can add to it, Frey added. Austin Arndt, a beef cattle farmer and neighbor of John Lader outside Janesville, hometown of Republican speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Paul Ryan, said his vote was more against Clinton than for Trump. He said his vote was based on Trumps promise to cut taxes and repeal Obamas signature 2010 healthcare law, which has enabled millions of previously uninsured Americans to gain medical coverage but is detested by conservatives as a government overreach. From the social point of view as candidates, they were both terrible people, said Arndt, 33. For me, it was all about the economics.  ",politicsNews,"November 11, 2016 ",1
"Trump seen more moderate on criminal justice, law enforcement","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Criminal justice reform advocates said they expect Donald Trump will embrace moderate change once he is in the White House, toning down the punitive but undefined law and order image he projected on the campaign trail. In another instance of experts trying to pin down Trump on an issue he used on the stump without offering much detail, two groups that have met recently with his staff said they expect him to back mainstream sentencing and corrections reforms. A Trump spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment. In a meeting a few weeks ago, Trumps staff was very receptive to arguments that crime rates have dropped in states that have reduced prison populations through sentencing reform, said Holly Harris, executive director of the U.S. Justice Action Network, a bipartisan coalition that spearheads legislative efforts to lower sentences for nonviolent offenders. Democratic President Barack Obama, many Republicans in Congress and several of Trumps conservative mentors have embraced changing sentencing standards and better prisons. During the campaign, Trump denounced Obama as being too soft on inner-city violence and for extremist plots against the United States and attacks on police officers. For instance, in the Oct. 19 presidential debate with Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, Trump said: We need law and order, but we need justice, too. Our inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store. They have no education. They have no jobs. But in the same month, Trumps vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, said he was proud that Indiana approved criminal justice reform during his tenure as governor.  We have got to do a better job recognizing and correcting the errors in the system that do reflect an institutional bias in criminal justice, he said. Tim Head, executive director of the conservative Christian Faith and Freedom Coalition, said his group has held advisory talks with the president-elects staff in recent days. Head said Trumps Justice Department is likely to emphasize greater support for law enforcement, maybe deference for law enforcement than Obama did. But Head and Harris also both noted that Republicans close to Trump, such as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie have advocated for reforms such as lowering sentences for some nonviolent crimes, improving prison conditions and helping former prisoners find jobs and housing. Christie and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani are reportedly on a short list of conservatives whom Trump is considering for U.S. attorney general. Inimai Chettiar, director of justice programs at the Brennan Center for Justice of New York University, said Trump made some  troubling campaign-trail claims. One, she said, was arguing that rising crime justifies stop-and-frisk tactics and other police methods that critics say unfairly target minorities. However, she said, she also hoped the president-elect would fall in line with members of the Republican Party who support bipartisan criminal justice reform. ",politicsNews,"November 11, 2016 ",1

A discontented Michigan town: America should have seen Trump coming,"ALGONAC, Mich. (Reuters) - Back in April, there were already early signs in this quiet Michigan town of the rural American discontent that helped propel Donald Trump to election victory, even if it was underestimated by the Washington establishment, pollsters and Hillary Clintons campaign. On a return visit after Tuesdays election, Reuters found that many of Algonacs 4,000 residents were jubilant that Trump had captured the White House, although there were also echoes of what some people said seven months ago: that he is an uncertain, high-stakes gamble. But the bare fact of his success drew only shrugs: Who else did city folks really expect would win? Reuters first visited this town on a bend of the St. Clair River in April after results from the Republican and Democratic parties' primary elections suggested it might be a hotbed of the  dissatisfaction with the status quo that would become a dominant force by November. (reut.rs/2fAVJQY) It was a town in a county in a state that all disproportionately turned out in the primaries for the unexpected outsider candidates: the Republican Trump, a rich real-estate developer and television star who had never held political office; and democratic socialist Bernie Sanders, a  U.S. senator from Vermont who had emerged as Clintons closest rival for the Democratic Party nomination. Trump went on to win his partys nomination, while Sanders was beaten by Clinton.  Even though they came at the problem from very different perspectives, both men had fired up a town that was in a sour mood, striking a chord with their talk of a rigged economic system and their loud disgust at the decline of American manufacturing. Algonac leans Republican, and, on both visits, it took no time at all to find Trump fans, and only a little longer to find Sanders fans. But it took days of asking around to find someone with a warm word for Clinton. On Tuesday, the vote in Algonac was 68 percent for Trump, 27 percent for Clinton. Residents of Algonac can easily list the relatives and neighbors who have struggled with the painful decline of manufacturing or who were forced to move after auto factories with well paid union jobs an hour away in the Detroit area shut down or moved abroad. Older residents recall decades back when Algonac was still a proud self-sufficient manufacturing hub, employing scores of locals at the Chris-Craft factory, which turned out photogenic wooden boats that remain prized by wealthy collectors.  Pete Beauregard has turned the factory into a harbor club where the towns summer visitors stow their boats.  The rural area is going to want to be heard, he said, delighting in Trumps victory. Up the road, Jay DeBoyer was in a dive bar he had worked in as a younger man, drinking an afternoon glass of water and dressed in a suit he had worn to deliver St. Clair Countys final elections results to the courthouse in his role as county clerk. The center of the country is what put Donald Trump in office, he said.  If the economys okay, they shut their mouths and go to work, he said, describing the sort of people who live in places like Algonac, where 97 percent of residents are white.  But if you start to smack them, when you start telling the guys working in a coal mine in West Virginia, For the good of the country, were going to put you out of a job, for the good of cleaner air were going to put you out of a job, then you start to create a constituency of people that fall into a category of the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Mentioning Clinton, a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady, tended to draw scorn among Algonac residents in April, even among some Democrats who said they viewed her as untrustworthy. Her election loss and emotional concession speech this week appeared not to soften this, with some expressing their ill-feeling in crude terms. Trump That Bitch, reads a tall wooden sign alongside the main road into town, evoking a familiar anti-Clinton slogan among Trump fans. Seeing it being photographed, Paul Paulus, 73, wandered out from the building where he was regreasing old tractors to boast he had built it entirely himself.  Some of his neighbors, particularly women, had told Reuters on both visits that, even if they disliked Clinton, they despaired at the insults and coarse language that Trump and his fans had reveled in. Paulus described his victory over such qualms. They had tried to get the township to take it down, he said, smiling at the memory of the fight as he looked up at his sign. But the township said its not coming down as bitch is not a bad word. Its a female dog. Jan Evans, a devout 64-year-old Christian who runs a store making slogan t-shirts for the local schools sports teams, said she thought there were better ways to talk about people. But she sympathized with the sort of anxiety that moved people to support Trump. She recently learned that her monthly health insurance premiums under Obamacare, a healthcare law that Trump has said he will repeal and replace, would go from $120 to $357. But she worried that Trumps victory would not help, either; she did not know what his healthcare plans were as he has not given details. She said that when she voted, she filled out down-ballot lines for local and state elections and left the presidential vote until the end to give her more time to think.  Neither one really deserved it, she said of Clinton and Trump. Her pen hovered for quite a while, but she declined to say where on the ballot it landed. Everybody, theyre a little bit frightened, theyre hopeful, they know we need change, she said of Trumps victory. But this is the change? ",politicsNews,"November 11, 2016 ",1
"U.S. consumers will want Trump, Congress to take on drug prices","LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans growing alarm over rising prescription drug costs will pressure a new U.S. administration and Congress to take action on pharmaceutical pricing, industry executives and healthcare experts say. Drugmaker stocks, battered in recent months, soared this week after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps victory. Democratic rival Hillary Clinton had vowed to take on pharmaceutical price gouging, and some pundits predicted the Democrats would gain control of the Senate, giving her a stronger hand. The Republican sweep of Congress eliminated those fears, while boosting chances for other measures, such as corporate tax reforms that would benefit industry. However, the vote did not change a key dynamic: U.S. consumers are paying more of the cost of drugs through higher health insurance deductibles and copayments, making them more sensitive to manufacturer price hikes. Most recently, a sixfold increase in the price of Mylan NVs EpiPen stoked outrage for families who rely on the lifesaving allergy shot and prompted investigations by state attorneys general and Congress. If a manufacturer sharply raises the price of a drug, it will be in the headlines. I dont think it matters which party is in office, said Sandra Hunt, principal at PricewaterhouseCoopers health industry practice. Republican lawmakers have taken up drug pricing alongside Democrats. Republicans Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Representative Jason Chaffetz, chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, led inquiries into Mylans EpiPen pricing. A very strong majority of Republican voters want the Congress to address drug prices, said John Rother, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care, which campaigns for lower prices. An October Kaiser Family Foundation survey showed that 74 percent of respondents said making drugs for chronic conditions affordable should be a top health care priority for the federal government. Among Republican respondents, 68 percent put drug prices as a top priority. A poll conducted by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that 64 percent of voters - including 78 percent of likely Clinton voters and 48 percent of Trump supporters - believe the federal government should be able to limit pharmaceutical drug price hikes. Trump and Republican leaders have vowed to repeal President Barack Obamas healthcare reform law, known as Obamacare, which has extended medical insurance to more than 20 million Americans. Despite complaints about Obamacare insurance premium increases, just 37 percent of Kaiser poll respondents said that overturning it was a high priority. Chaffetz is evaluating his next steps on the drug pricing issue when the next Congress convenes, an aide said. A representative for Grassley said he would press forward with a scheduled Nov. 30 hearing into Mylans EpiPen pricing. The U.S. has always been a country that supports innovation ... and we hope it will remain the same, said Pascal Soriot, chief executive of AstraZeneca Plc, which sells drugs like cholesterol-fighter Crestor. But we also believe we will continue to have to deal with price ressures.   Clintons proposals to curb drug prices included capping consumers monthly out-of-pocket costs. In the past, Trump has suggested allowing the governments Medicare health program for seniors to negotiate prices and making it easier to import drugs from countries where they sell for less. A Trump administration also could provide extra funding to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to speed approval of generic drugs, which still tend to cost far less than their brand name equivalents, health policy experts said. Capital Alpha Partners analyst Kim Monk, in a research note on Wednesday, said she expects advisors and Congress to steer Trump toward more Republican-oriented ideas, including pricing drugs based on their relative health benefit and requiring more disclosure of pricing details. Consumer advocate Rother cited the FAIR Drug Pricing Act, introduced in September by Senators John McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Tammy Baldwin, Wisconsin Democrat, as a potential vehicle for federal action. The bill would require manufacturers to explain annual price increases of more than 10 percent. It is a bipartisan bill consistent with traditional Republican health policy based on transparency and competition, Rother said. In California, voters on Tuesday rejected a ballot measure that would have require drugmakers to provide state health plans with discounts similar to those given to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA pays the lowest prices in the country.    Drugmakers spent more than $106 million on a campaign to defeat the measure.      A similar measure will go before Ohio voters, who backed Trump in the election, next November. The coalition behind Californias proposition on Wednesday urged legislators to come up with a more comprehensive solution to lower sky-rocketing drug prices. ",politicsNews,"November 11, 2016 ",1
Trump win puts U.S.-Russia hostility on hold - but for how long?,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After years of rising U.S.-Russia tensions over Ukraine, Syria, cyber attacks and nuclear arms control, Donald Trumps election as U.S. president may offer a narrow window to repair relations as he and Russian President Vladimir Putin size up each other. But Trumps ascent to the White House carries the risk of  dangerous miscalculation if the U.S. president-elect and Putin, two willful personalities and self-styled strong leaders who have exchanged occasional compliments, decide they have misjudged one another, according to Russia experts and others. U.S. officials and private analysts predict that Putin, who has reasserted Moscows military and political muscle from eastern Europe to the Middle East, will avoid openly provoking Trump before he takes office. Putin has the ability to advance his interests in many different ways. Sometimes tactical diplomacy can help, said Fiona Hill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think-tank. Were in temporary truce phase, said Hill, who has served as the U.S. national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia in the George W. Bush and Obama administrations and co-authored a book on Putin. Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow under President Barack Obama, said Putin likely will wait to see if he can reach some accommodation with Trump to allow the lifting of Ukraine-related sanctions imposed by Washington and the European Union that have contributed to Russias growing economic woes. During the campaign, Trump was criticized by his Democratic Party rival, Hillary Clinton, for praising Putin as a strong leader and saying ties with Russia should be improved at a time when Moscow and Washington are at odds over Syria and Ukraine. Trump rattled Washingtons European allies with comments questioning NATOs mutual self-defense pledge and suggesting that he might recognize Russias 2014 annexation of Ukraines Crimea region. Putin last year called Trump a really brilliant and talented person and the Kremlin said on Thursday that the U.S. president-elects foreign policy approach was phenomenally close to that of the Russian leader. Putin has a future president who has expressed a desire to cooperate, who has expressed a desire to move away from the Obama policies. Why would you screw that up with a provocation? asked McFaul, now at Stanford University. In Syria, a U.S. official said, Putin appears to be extending a humanitarian pause in air strikes against moderate rebels holding the eastern side of Aleppo to give Trump an opportunity to affirm the willingness he expressed during the campaign to seek a more cooperative U.S.-Russian relationship. I think they were holding their fire for the purpose of decreasing the international pressure on them, and now, like the rest of the world, they may be taking stock of the current situation, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. But U.S. officials caution that Russia still may feel compelled to launch more attacks after dispatching a naval task force led by the aging aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov to the eastern Mediterranean in a show of force. The U.S. government has publicly accused Moscow of hacking the Democratic National Committee and other party organizations during the election campaign, which Russia has denied. Trump declined to blame Russia, and the Election Day Russian cyber attacks that some officials feared never materialized. Trump has not laid out a detailed Russia policy, and many in his party, including potential top advisors and cabinet officials, have taken a hawkish view of Moscow. Former House of Representatives speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally rumored for a senior post, lambasted in 2014 what he called Obamas weak response to Russias land-grab in Ukraine. Putin, Gingrich wrote, is a ruthlessly determined leader motivated by nationalism and an imperial drive. And while there was celebration in Moscow after Trumps victory over former secretary of state Clinton, who has been sharply critical of Putin, some Russians cautioned against euphoria. The idea that it will be easier to strike a deal with Trump than Clinton is wrong. ... Everything will be tested when we get down to business, analyst Vladimir Bruter told the daily pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda before Tuesdays election. Some experts and U.S. officials say there is a high risk of miscalculation or even confrontation, given Trumps history of  taking slights and challenges personally.  Thats actually where reality is going to intrude, Hill said. Putins pretty thin-skinned, too. Putin has a penchant for challenging adversaries, particularly when he senses weakness, and he has long made it clear that he intends to reassert what he considers Russias rightful global role. Suspending a treaty with Washington on cleaning up weapons-grade plutonium last month, Putin listed conditions for resuming Russian participation that amounted to a laundry list of grievances against the United States. The demands included lifting Ukraine-related U.S. economic sanctions, compensating Moscow for those sanctions and reducing the U.S. military presence in NATOs eastern European states to the levels of 16 years ago. Russias bedrock concern is whether they believe the threat of U.S.-promoted regime change is abating under a President Trump, said Andrew Weiss, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Everything else is a secondary, lower-order problem. Putin has accused the U.S. government of promoting widespread street protests in Russia following its 2011 elections, as well as the color revolutions in Georgia, Ukraine and elsewhere. On specific issues, Weiss said, there are few if any easy opportunities for rapid U.S.-Russian agreements. The agendas really threadbare, he said. Were basically at a standstill.

Britain's Johnson says no need for gloom about Trump victory,"BELGRADE (Reuters) - British ForeignSecretary Boris Johnson, setting aside his previous hostility toward Donald Trump, said on Thursday the U.S. Republicans presidential election victory offered economic opportunities and there was no need for Europeans to be despondent about it. I may respectfully say to my European friends and colleagues that its time we snapped out of general doom and gloom about this election, Johnson said after meeting Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic.       He is after all a deal maker. He wants to do a free trade deal with the UK, Johnson told reporters. Trumps upset victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton has delighted far-right politicians in France, the Netherlands and Austria but worried some mainstream politicians who fear it may be part of a populist, anti-establishment trend. I believe that this is a great opportunity for us in the UK to build on that relationship with America that is of fundamental economic importance for us but also of great importance for stability and prosperity in the world, Johnson said. Johnson was one of the leading proponents of the successful Brexit campaign to get Britain out of the European Union. Trump aligned himself with the Brexit movement during his campaign.    On Wednesday, Johnson, the former London mayor, congratulated Trump on his victory and tweeted that he looked forward to continuing the partnership between the two nations. Johnson said last year that he feared going to New York because of the real risk of meeting Donald Trump after the New York businessman said parts of London were now so radicalized that police officers feared to go there. Later on Thursday, Johnson said on his Twitter account he had spoken to U.S. Vice President-elect Mike Pence.

Trump win opens way for China to take climate leadership role,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - The election of climatechangeskeptic Donald Trump as president is likely to end the U.S. leadership role in the international fight against global warming and may lead to the emergence of a new and unlikely champion: China. China worked closely with the administration of outgoing President Barack Obama to build momentum ahead of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The partnership of the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters helped get nearly 200 countries to support the pact at the historic meet in Frances capital. By contrast, Trump has called global warming a hoax created by China to give it an economic advantage and said he plans to remove the United States from the historic climate agreement, as well as reverse many of Obamas measures to combat climate change.  He has appointed noted climate change skeptic Myron Ebell to help lead transition planning for the Environmental Protection Agency, which has crafted the administrations major environmental regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and efficiency standards for cars and trucks. Beijing is poised to cash in on the goodwill it could earn by taking on leadership in dealing with what for many other governments is one of the most urgent issues on their agenda. Proactively taking action against climate change will improve Chinas international image and allow it to occupy the moral high ground, Zou Ji, deputy director of the National Centre for Climate Change Strategy and a senior Chinese climate talks negotiator, told Reuters. Zou said that if Trump abandons efforts to implement the Paris agreement, Chinas influence and voice are likely to increase in global climate governance, which will then spill over into other areas of global governance and increase Chinas global standing, power and leadership. Chen Zhihua, a representative of the Chinese delegation and official in the climate change division of the National Development and Reform Commission, the countrys economic planning agency, said Chinese and other countries efforts will not change if the United States withdraws from the agreement.  Action by the international community will not stop because of the new government of the United States. We still have confidence the international community will join hands and continue our efforts on climate change, he told reporters at the 200-nation U.N. meeting being held in Marrakesh to start fleshing out the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement seeks to phase out net greenhouse gas emissions by the second half of the century and limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. Each country has put forward national plans to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Some have raised concerns that without involvement and financial support from the United States, emerging economies like India may feel inclined to back out. One of the key advisors to Obamas team on climate change said he hoped China would take on the mantle and keep the global climate deal alive.  Beijing should continue to work in the spirit that we worked together in and before Paris, said Andrew Light, former senior adviser to previous U.S. Special Envoy on Climate Change Todd Stern. It is an ironic twist for the government of the worlds second-largest economy. For years, Beijing fought attempts by foreign governments to limit carbon emissions, claiming it should be allowed the same space to develop and pollute that industrialized nations had. But with its capital often choked by smog and its people angry about the environmental devastation that rapid development has wrought across the country, Beijing has become a proponent of efforts to halt global warming rather than a hindrance. China is acting on climate for the benefit of its own people, said Erik Solheim, executive director of the UN Environment Programme. I am confident China will take a lead role. China has powerful domestic and global imperatives to play a high-profile role in continued global climate change talks, meant to avert more heat waves, droughts, floods and rising sea levels that could cause trillions of dollars of damage by 2100. China sees a perceived role as global climate leader as way to bolster its aspiration to become a clean energy superpower by leading in renewable energy technology such as wind and solar power and asserting itself as a key geopolitical power.      Dealing with the pressures of continued urbanization in some of the worlds largest cities has already put China ahead, said Andrew Steer, the president of environmental think tank the World Resources Institute.  Beijing is innovating to build low-carbon cities, he said.  It sees carbon as an indicator of economic inefficiency, Steer said. Trumps victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton darkened the mood of delegates attending the current round of climate talks in Marrakesh.  Some delegates at the talks say that China is already setting an example.  China is surprising us daily. Whatever theyve promised theyre delivering, said Tosi Mpanu Mpanu, of Democratic Republic of Congo, who heads the 48-nation group of least developed countries at the talks.

"Uncertain Afghanistan looks to Trump for decisions on troops, aid","KABUL (Reuters) - With so much riding on American support, Afghanistan is waiting anxiously to see if President-elect Donald Trump matches his maverick image and reverses policy or keeps to a path that has cost billions and committed thousands of troops to propping up a fragile ally. Much to the private annoyance of officials in Kabul, Americas longest war barely featured in the election campaign, but few were expecting the billionaire property developer to beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Its been a complete surprise, said one senior Afghan official closely involved in national security issues. I think everyone was expecting the opposite result. It (Afghanistan) wasnt a priority in the campaign, thats obvious. No one talked about Afghanistan at all. At least with Mrs. Clinton, though, you knew more or less what you were getting. Afghanistan will nonetheless present the incoming Trump administration with one of its most intractable foreign policy challenges. The United States has spent some $115 billion in aid for Afghanistan, but 15 years after the hardline Islamist Taliban were toppled after the Sept. 11 attacks, a third of the country is out of government control and security forces are struggling. As recently as last week two U.S. service members were killed fighting the Taliban near the northern city of Kunduz, and expectations that Afghan security forces could survive without extensive foreign assistance have proved illusory. Faced with a mounting Taliban insurgency, Obama dropped his original aim of pulling out of Afghanistan entirely. In July, he decided to keep 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, shelving earlier plans to bring the numbers down to 5,500 and leaving it to his successor to decide how to move forward. Before the election, U.S. officials told partners that Afghanistan, whose war-ruined economy depends heavily on billions of dollars in foreign aid, will not be neglected by the new administration and that ties will remain strong and close. You can be assured that Afghanistan will remain at the highest levels of our foreign policy agenda, Ambassador Michael McKinley told an election day party at the U.S. embassy in Kabul, before the final results of the ballot were in. However, Trumps America First doctrine has left many wondering if he will be willing to continue spending billions of dollars funding Afghanistan, particularly given his declaration that: Were getting out of the nation-building business. Among Afghans who use social media, a sense that the incoming president is opposed to their old enemy Pakistan made some hope his election would be good for Afghanistan, but there is little to go on for those trying to parse his public remarks. So far, he has shown little interest in Afghanistan, although his most recent comments suggested he favored keeping troop numbers at around 5,500, the level they were intended to reach by the end of the year before Obama shelved the plan and set the number at 8,400. But in other comments, he has described Americas involvement in Afghanistan as a terrible mistake and appeared to set conditions on the U.S. commitment to NATO, which leads the Resolute Support advise-and-assist mission in Afghanistan. Security officials in Kabul say the threat that Islamic State militants could build their presence in Afghanistan should act as an incentive to keep a U.S. force in place, although they admit they remain in the dark about Trumps intentions. As Trump promised during his campaign that he would eliminate Daesh (Islamic State), we dont think he would withdraw American forces from Afghanistan as Daesh is a new threat for Afghanistan and the region, said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. But we are still in a state of uncertainty and we will wait and see what Trump has for Afghanistan, he added. The decision will be vital for a country that is likely to depend on American support for years to come. The United States will almost certainly continue to be the leading source of both military and civilian reconstruction aid to Afghanistan for years to come, the latest report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a Congressional oversight body, said only last month. In an interview with CNN television last year, Trump himself appeared to accept that it was too late to pull U.S. forces out. And at this point, you probably have to stay because that thing will collapse about two seconds after they leave, he said, in the interview in October, 2015. ",politicsNews,"November 11, 2016 ",1
"Expert Views: What will be the impact of Trump presidency on immigration, refugees?","NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The election of Republican Donald Trump to be the next U.S. president raises questions about the impact his administration  could have upon immigrants in the United States and the nations immigration and refugee policies. During his campaign Trump took a hardline position, proposing to build a wall along the United States border with Mexico and deport millions of undocumented immigrants. He also said he opposes accepting refugees fleeing violence in Syria and that Muslims should be banned from entering the United States, a proposal he later reworded as a call for a limit on immigration from terror-prone regions. Here are some experts views: Jennifer Gordon, professor at Fordham Law School in New York and an expert on immigration policy: Trump campaigned on a promise to deport over 10 million undocumented immigrants. To carry this out would require staggering resources.But given his attacks on undocumented people, one thing seems near-certain: he will exercise his authority to cancel the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that President Obama put in place to protect young undocumented immigrants.This will leave many hard-working undocumented teachers, housekeepers, lawyers, construction workers, students, health aides and doctors in a tremendously vulnerable position.Our country is richer in every way for their presence.We must fight with every tool at our disposal to defend the core American value of inclusion. Lavinia Limon, president, U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, Washington: We encourage our new president to continue the tradition of the best of American values including equal protection and respect for every member of society. Worldwide, millions are denied basic human rights and we are strengthened as a country when all of humanity is recognized. America has always been the beacon of hope for the oppressed and this must continue. Throughout our history refugees and immigrants have been welcomed to America by presidents from both parties in war and in peace and the current global refugee crisis is no time to shrink from this leadership. Gal Adam Spinrad, economic empowerment program coordinator, Refugee Womens Network Inc., Decatur, Georgia:  The words immigrant, refugee, Muslim, walls and terrorism have ignited fear, hostility and division throughout the 2016 presidential election cycle. Refugees are scared right now. Their safety and future here feels more tenuous, and the messages they have heard throughout this election have in many cases revictimized and retraumatized them. They are concerned their missing family members wont be allowed to join them in America. They fear they will lose their green cards or be deported. Like their American counterparts, they worry about how they will get health insurance, whether they will be able to go to college, if their food stamps will be lowered, if they will lose the Social Security disability coverage they began receiving after an injury at one of the local chicken factories where many of them work. Our hope is that the incoming presidential administration - supported by the legislature on both sides of the aisle - will retain a spirit of inclusion that makes refugees feel not only welcome, but safe. Doris Meissner, director of U.S. immigration policy program, Migration Policy Institute, Washington: The Trump administration can be expected to chart a very different course on immigration and refugee policy, as the candidates views of immigration as a security and economic threat were central to his campaign. The most immediate changes are likely to be over refugee resettlement and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Mr. Trump has made clear his intent to end the resettlement of Syrian refugees, and it will be within the presidents authority to set refugee allocations by country and overall. He also pledged to terminate the DACA program, which provides relief from deportation to more than 700,000 unauthorized immigrants whose parents brought them here as children. He has also pledged to increase deportations of unauthorized immigrants. Stephen Yale-Loehr, professor of immigration law practice,  Cornell Law School, Ithaca, New York: Donald Trump made immigration restrictions a big part of his campaign. Now we will see if he follows through on his immigration plans. Some actions, like reversing President Obamas executive actions that protect millions of young immigrants from deportation, can be done unilaterally. Others, like building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, will require Congress to change current law or spend billions of dollars. Although Republicans will control Congress for the next two years, it is always difficult to enact significant immigration changes because immigration is so complex and controversial. Moreover, some of his immigration changes could be challenged in court. President-elect Trump stated in his victory speech that he will be fair to everyone. Lets hope he keeps that promise to immigrants.   Jim DeMint, president, Heritage Foundation, and former U.S. Senator from South Carolina: Donald Trump campaigned on the promise to reverse the liberal policies of the Obama administration and pursue a largely conservative agenda, and securing our borders was his signature campaign issue. While pundits focused on the wall and who would pay for it, his proposals were more comprehensive. For instance, people overstaying their visas account for 40 percent of the nations illegal immigrant population. Trump pledged to address that problem by fixing the nations entry-exit tracking system. As for refugees, President Obama announced plans to admit 110,000 refugees - 40,000 from the Middle East and South Asia regions - in fiscal year 2017. Trumps preferred plan is to establish safe havens in Syria.He argues that this approach would safeguard ten times as many refugees as could be accommodated in this country. Mark Krikorian, executive director, Center for Immigration Studies, Washington: A Trump administration will restart routine immigration enforcement. This is a major change from the Obama policy of ignoring most non-violent immigration offenders. This means more border fencing, penalizing crooked businesses and implementing a check-out system for foreign visitors to prevent overstays (the main source of new illegal immigration). Regarding legal immigration, refugee resettlement from the Middle East is likely to be suspended, pending a bottom-up review of the system.Foreign-worker programs will be modified so they cant be used to replace American workers, as now. And over the longer term, our legal immigration system is likely to be shifted from its emphasis on family ties to one that focuses on skills. Marielena Hincapie, executive director, National Immigration Law Center, Los Angeles: The election of a candidate who staked his presidential bid on racist, xenophobic and misogynistic rhetoric has left our country more polarized than ever. President-elect Trump touted draconian changes to our immigration system, which should gravely concern everyone who cares about our values of fairness and equality.  Many of Trumps immigration proposals dont square with our Constitution. Our communities have successfully beaten back similar ill-conceived proposals in states like Arizona and Alabama, and we will continue [to] fight - in the courtroom, if necessary - to ensure that the rights of immigrant and refugee communities are protected across the country. David Bier, immigration policy analyst, Cato Institute, Washington: Donald Trump promised to limit the flow of Muslim refugees. Current law leaves refugee admissions up to presidential discretion, and he could accomplish this on Day One. Compared to a religious test, barring refugees from countries with large Muslim populations would be easy to enforce and, assuming no reallocation, could reduce refugee flows by 40 percent. This would exclude Christians, however, whom he promised to save, and that could lead to pushback from Congress. Trump may adopt one solution to which some Republicans have expressed openness: allowing Americans to sponsor their refugee family members. This could help Christian refugees while overcoming Trumps security objections for certain Muslims, since DNA could verify their U.S. connections and sponsors could receive thorough vetting.

U.S. consumer financial agency could be defanged under Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, already in legal limbo after an October court decision, could find its powers scaled back by President-elect Donald Trump and a Republican-led Congress, according to members of both political parties, lobbyists and lawyers.  That may mean the end of many of the agencys rule-making actions that have enraged critics, including a proposal to stop companies from blocking customers from class action lawsuits and another one to limit payday lending. Creation of the CFPB was authorized in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law enacted in the aftermath of the 2007-09 financial crisis. The agency began operations in 2011. An agency to protect consumers finances was the idea of liberal Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Its creation is considered one of Democratic President Barack Obamas top domestic policy achievements. A Trump administration is expected to be hostile to the agency as it is currently formulated. The election spells very bad news for the CFPB, said Alan Kaplinsky, head of the Consumer Financial Services Group at law firm Ballard Spahr.  Many Republicans opposed the agencys creation. They now say they dislike its structure and believe it oversteps its authority in enforcement. Its a very fragile thing. It was birthed in controversy and is under constant attack, said consumer attorney Deepak Gupta, who worked at the CFPB in its early days. It may not survive the way we know it through this administration. A single director leads both rule-making and enforcement, and can be dismissed only for cause. Furthermore, the agency is funded by the U.S. Federal Reserve system, which means it is not dependent on the typical congressional appropriations process. The Republican-led House of Representatives Financial Services Committee in September passed legislation without any Democratic votes that would change the name and structure of the agency and would create a five-member commission to govern it. Republicans also have pushed for the agency to receive funds from Congress to make it accountable to elected leaders. Both of those proposals would greatly weaken the power of Richard Cordray, the agencys original and current director. Obama has blocked these Republican efforts with veto threats. Trump, though he has not directly addressed the CFPB, has said he wants to roll back parts of Dodd-Frank. Trump could, if he wanted to, fire Cordray on the first day of his presidency, especially following an October ruling by a three-judge federal appeals court panel that found the agencys structure unconstitutional and that the president should be able to dismiss the director at will. That ruling was put on hold while the CFPB decides whether to petition the entire U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for a review or appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. The agency has until Nov. 25 to decide. Trumps administration could withdraw any appeal, letting the decision stand. Cordray, appointed in 2013, is halfway through his five-year term. Few in the banking industry think the entire agency will be eliminated. Democrats who support the agency will have a large presence in the Senate. Warren, who was Obamas first choice to head the agency, has promised that Democrats will fight efforts to defang it. Even some bankers want to see it stay. Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, said his group would fight to maintain the CFPB in some form because it consolidates consumer banking rules under one regulator.  Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Cordray could be replaced early in 2017, said Mark Calabria, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank. Trumps transition team is already looking into Cordray replacements, he said. The law allows for the president to terminate a director over inefficiency, malfeasance or neglect of duty, which leaves room for Trump to find cause regardless of what the appeals court decides, Calabria added. Cordray has set precedent with enforcement cases that Calabria and other critics have called backdoor rule-making.  Cordray has left the CFPB vulnerable to what his successor may want done because he didnt hardwire rule-making, Calabria said. If Cordray quits or is removed, statute calls for his deputy to step into the job temporarily. Acting Deputy Director David Silberman, also a strong consumer advocate, would likely continue to carry out the current agenda, said Quyen Truong, a partner at Washington law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. Truong was the assistant director and deputy general counsel for the CFPB until earlier this year. The CFPB did not respond to requests for comment on Cordrays possible departure or the fate of current rule-making actions.  ",politicsNews,"November 11, 2016 ",1
Judge tells Trump University litigants they would be wise to settle,"SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - The U.S. judge overseeing a lawsuit against President-elect Donald Trump and his Trump University told both sides they would be wise to settle the case given all else thats involved. Lawyers for the president-elect are squaring off against students who claim they were they were lured by false promises to pay up to $35,000 to learn Trumps real estate investing secrets from his hand-picked instructors. Earlier on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel tentatively rejected a bid by Trump to keep a wide range of statements from the presidential campaign out of the fraud trial. Trump owned 92 percent of Trump University and had control over all major decisions, the students court papers say. The president-elect denies the allegations and has argued that he relied on others to manage the business.  Trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 28, and Curiel told lawyers he was not inclined to delay the six-year-old case further. Trump lawyer Daniel Petrocelli said he would ask to put the trial on hold until early next year, in light of the many tasks the magnate has before his inauguration. Curiel said he would allow both sides to file briefs on whether to delay the case. He also indicated they should consider making a deal.  It would be wise for the plaintiffs, for the defendants, to look closely at trying to resolve this case given all else thats involved, Curiel said. Petrocelli told reporters after the hearing that Trump might have to be a little more flexible about settling the case now that he is president-elect, although the lawyer wasnt sure his client would was willing. Curiel said that he would allow Trump to testify via video given his presidential obligations.  In the tentative ruling Curiel, based in San Diego, said Trumps lawyers can renew objections to specific campaign statements and evidence during trial. Trumps attorneys had argued that jurors should not hear about statements Trump made during the campaign, including about Curiel himself. Trump attacked the judge as biased against him. He claimed Curiel, who was born in Indiana but is of Mexican descent, could not be impartial because of Trumps pledge to build a wall between the United States and Mexico.  Trumps lawyers argued that Curiel should bar from the trial accusations about Trumps personal conduct including alleged sexual misconduct, his taxes and corporate bankruptcies, along with speeches and tweets. They argued the information is irrelevant to the jury and prejudicial to the case.  In court papers, lawyers for the students claimed that Trumps statements would help jurors as they weigh the Republicans credibility. Defendants have not identified specific evidence that they wish to exclude, Curiel wrote on Thursday. Accordingly, the court declines to issue a blanket ruling at this time. The judge also barred Trump lawyers from telling jurors that the university had a 98 percent approval rate on student evaluations. That rating is irrelevant as to whether Trump University misrepresented itself, Curiel wrote. Curiel is presiding over two cases against Trump and the university. A separate lawsuit by New Yorks attorney general is pending. ",politicsNews,"November 10, 2016 ",1
Trump and Obama set campaign rancor aside with White House meeting,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump met on Thursday for the first time, setting aside the deep rancor that dominated the long campaign season to discuss the transition to the Republicans inauguration on Jan. 20. Their 90-minute meeting in the White House Oval Office, with no aides present, took place just two days after Trumps stunning election victory over Hillary Clinton, Obamas former secretary of state. Obama, who vigorously campaigned for his fellow Democrat to succeed him, had repeatedly called Trump unfit for the presidents office, while the businessman had often dubbed  Obamas eight-year tenure a disaster. But in separate post-election remarks on Wednesday, both men appeared to seek to help the country heal from a bitterly divisive campaign, and that tone continued into the White House meeting.  Seated next to Obama after their talks, Trump told reporters: We really discussed a lot of situations, some wonderful, some difficulties. He said Obama explained some of the really great things that have been achieved, but did not elaborate. It was a great honor being with you and I look forward to being with you many, many more times in the future, Trump said, with a tone of deference. Trump, a real estate magnate who has never held political office, later met congressional leaders, including U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican who has had a strained relationship with Trump. A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry, Trump said on Twitter late on Thursday. Amid the efforts to bury hatchets, there were protests in a string of U.S. cities against Trump for a second day on Thursday as demonstrators expressed concern that Trumps election would be a blow to civil rights. Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair! Trump tweeted. Obama said he had offered assistance to Trump over the next couple of months, and urged the country to unite to face its challenges. We now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed, then the country succeeds, Obama said, adding he and Trump discussed a range of domestic and foreign policy issues and details related to the transition period. The meeting might have been at least a little less awkward than some might have expected, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters.     The two mens relaxed, cordial demeanor in front of the cameras was in stark contrast to the months of harsh rhetoric during the campaign. Trump used Obama as a punching bag during his campaign speeches, repeatedly attacking the presidents policies from healthcare to an Iran nuclear deal. Both Obama and first lady Michelle Obama attacked Trump as temperamentally unfit for the White House and dangerously unprepared to have access to U.S. nuclear codes. Asked at a White House briefing on Thursday whether the meeting had eased any of the concerns about Trump that Obama expressed during the campaign, Earnest said: The president was never in a position to choose a successor. The American people chose his successor.          Trump went from the White House to Capitol Hill for meetings with Republican congressional leaders, most of whom had a frosty relationship with Trump during a campaign where he tore into the Washington establishment.  Republicans retained control of the Senate and House in Tuesdays election, meaning at least some of Trumps agenda may find friendly terrain in Congress. Trump emerged from meeting Ryan, along with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, to tell reporters: Were going to lower taxes as you know. He added, in reference to Obamas signature healthcare reform of 2010 that is a common target of Trump and congressional Republicans: Were going to fix healthcare and make it more affordable and better.  Ryan has sought to smooth over his relationship with Trump and his spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said he was excited for the potential for unified Republican government and eager to get to work with Mr. Trump. Trump also met for an hour with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, saying afterward that he had told the senator his top three priorities were better control of immigration and the borders, healthcare and jobs. In what seemed like a possible early pivot by Trump, controversial campaign proposals, including his call to ban Muslims from entering the United States, disappeared for a while on Thursday from the president-elects campaign website. His campaign later blamed a technical problem and the statements were returned to the website.  Trump declined to respond when asked by reporters after meeting with McConnell if he would ask Congress to ban Muslims from entering the country. On another Trump campaign pledge, a top Trump aide, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told NPR he did not expect him to spend much time trying to make Mexico pay for a proposed wall along the U.S. southern border, but it was a great campaign device. Such proposals, along with his free-wheeling tone and frequent insults of critics and rivals, earned Trump the disapproval of not just Democrats but many in the Republican establishment during the election campaign. Trumps camp also showed signs it was beginning building a government, with names for top Cabinet positions being leaked. Steve Bannon, Trumps campaign chief, and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus could be named chief of staff. Trump has long hinted that his Treasury secretary could be campaign finance chair Steven Mnuchin, formerly of Goldman Sachs, but there were reports U.S. Representative Jeb Hensarling and J.P. Morgans Jamie Dimon were also being considered. Thursdays start at fence-mending also included meetings between Vice President Joe Biden and his future successor, Pence, and between the current and future first ladies.  Michelle Obama met privately with Trumps wife, Melania, in the White House residence. Michelle Obama has raised two daughters in the White House and the Trumps have a son, 10 year-old Barron. The two women discussed raising children at the White House, Earnest said. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot!, Donald Trump said on Twitter.  ",politicsNews,"November 10, 2016 ",1
Liberal Warren throws down gauntlet to President-elect Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democrats liberal firebrand, Senator Elizabeth Warren, threw down the gauntlet to President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday, telling labor union members there are financial and social issues where her party will fight him and continuing to blast the Republican. Battling bigotry is the first job for Democrats after the election, said Warren, of Massachusetts, giving a sense of how her party will operate now that it no longer controls the White House and remains the minority in both chambers of Congress. We will fight back against attacks on Latinos, African Americans, women, Muslims, immigrants, disabled Americans - on anyone, said Warren, who sparred frequently over Twitter with Trump and criticized him on the campaign trail in the weeks leading up to Tuesdays election. Whether Donald Trump sits in a glass tower or sits in the White House, we will not give an inch on this, not now, not ever. She said Trump had encouraged a toxic stew of hatred and fear and during the campaign regularly made statements that undermined core values of our democracy.  In the speech to the AFL-CIO labor federation, Warren also said Democrats will resist attempts to loosen financial regulation, gut the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law and eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  If Trump and the Republican Party try to turn loose the big banks and financial institutions so they can once again gamble with our economy and bring it all crashing down, then we will fight them every step of the way, she said. Warren did highlight areas of agreement. She said count me in on Trumps support of a new Glass-Steagall law to separate investment and retail banking, reforming trade deals, maintaining Social Security benefits, helping on childcare and college costs and rebuilding infrastructure. Warren rose to lead the liberal wing of the party during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. After Republicans blocked President Barack Obamas attempt to appoint her as the first director of the CFPB, she won a seat in Congress.  In 2015, progressive groups and a political action committee pressed her to run for president. Since Trumps victory on Tuesday, many have already renewed their calls, for the 2020 presidential election. ",politicsNews,"November 10, 2016 ",1
Mayors of NY and Los Angeles pledge to remain immigrant sanctuaries,"LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Officials in New York and Los Angeles on Thursday said they hoped President-elect Donald Trump would not follow through on a campaign promise to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities that shield people who are in the country illegally. The nations two largest cities have sharply limited their cooperation with U.S. immigration authorities seeking to deport undocumented immigrants. President Barack Obamas administration has used so-called detainer requests to target undocumented immigrants convicted of criminal acts, especially violent ones. New York and Los Angeles do not hold undocumented inmates in jail at the request of the U.S. Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) unless the detainer request is accompanied by a judges order, officials said. Trump said during a debate with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in October he would seek to deport major drug dealers. We have some bad hombres here and were going to get them out, he said.  Trump early in his campaign pledged to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States and also threatened to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference on Thursday that New York would continue to defend undocumented immigrants. We are not going to sacrifice a half million people who live among us, who are part of our community, de Blasio said, referring to an estimate of the number of unauthorized immigrants living in New York. We are not going to tear families apart.  De Blasio said Trumps threat to withhold funds from sanctuary cities was dangerous, but it was too soon to tell whether the president-elect intended to follow through on all his proposals. A spokeswoman for Trump did not return emails or a call. In Los Angeles, a spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Garcetti also voiced hopes over how Trump would proceed on the issue. We comply with federal immigration agencies, but insist that detainer requests be handled constitutionally, Connie Llanos, the spokeswoman, said in an email.  It is Mayor Garcettis sincere hope that no president would violate those principles, the very foundation of our nation, by taking punitive action on cities that are simply protecting thewell being of residents.  California is one of five states that limit compliance with ICE detainer requests and similar policies are in place at 37 cities nationwide, according to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. Last month, a federal judge in Illinois found the ICE detainer requests were unconstitutional, but the ruling did not apply nationwide. ",politicsNews,"November 11, 2016 ",1
Trump could easily erase much of Obama's foreign policy legacy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obamas foreign policy legacy rests in part on a foundation of unilateral actions that his successor Donald Trump could reverse with the stroke of a pen. Due to take office on Jan. 20, Trump, the winner in Tuesdays election, campaigned at times to dismantle Obamas nuclear deal with Iran and to reimpose sanctions Obama eased on Cuba. Trump also disagreed with foreign policy decisions that included the way Obama has deployed troops abroad to combat Islamist militant groups. In his most notable foreign policy achievements, Obama, a Democrat, used executive authorities that offered a convenient legal path around a Republican-controlled Congress committed to blocking his agenda. The U.S. Constitution gives a president broad executive powers to enact foreign policy. Both Republican and Democratic presidents have sought to exercise those powers by issuing executive orders, presidential memoranda and what are called findings. He (Obama) relied on executive authority to build a foreign policy legacy, said Thomas Wright, director of the Project on International Order and Strategy at the Brookings Institution.  That is all vulnerable to countervailing executive authority by a Trump administration, Wright said. Obama had hoped to pass his legacy on to Democrat Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state, but she lost the presidential election to Trump, a Republican businessman who has never held public office or served in the military.  Often contradicting himself during the campaign, Trump made it difficult to know for sure what policies he would pursue. Major constraints include budget caps, laws he cannot reverse without Congress, and the pressure that will emerge to replace policies he chooses to abandon. Trump said in an October speech that he would cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama on his first day in office, without saying who would determine their constitutionality. A Trump spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday on his latest plans. Perhaps nowhere has Obama faced more congressional opposition than in his pursuit of the 2015 deal with Iran, which Republicans and some Democrats said put too few restrictions on Irans nuclear program in return for too much sanctions relief. Trump has vowed to dismantle it, although his statements on the deal have been contradictory. A president may tighten and relax economic sanctions by executive order. Anything enacted by executive order can be rescinded by executive order, said Zachary Goldman, a former U.S. Treasury official now at New York University. Obama drew enough support from Democrats to block a Republican-led resolution rejecting the Iran deal, achieving a political victory but falling short of a consensus.  Trump will have the added advantage of working with a U.S. Senate and a House of Representatives controlled by fellow Republicans. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday he hoped Trump would see how much he can undo the unilateral actions the president took all by himself, which would not require us. Breaking with longstanding U.S. policy on another issue, Obama restored diplomatic ties with Cuba in 2015. But facing opposition in Congress to lifting a broad economic embargo, especially from Republicans, he used executive actions to ease some U.S. sanctions. Obama capped his Cuba efforts last month with a sweeping  presidential policy directive, which also is reversible and sets forth mandates for government engagement, people-to-people exchanges, and greater U.S. business ties. Trump has taken contradictory positions on whether he supports the embargo or not. Obamas aides said the easing of restrictions was aimed at securing enough benefits for U.S. businesses and travelers that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for any Republican president to reverse the opening to Cuba. Trump could roll back Obamas efforts to create greater transparency about drone strikes. Obama issued an executive order in July requiring annual disclosures about such strikes. As commander-in-chief, Trump will wield the power to mobilize the U.S. military on short notice and without first seeking approval from Congress. Obama deployed U.S. troops to Iraq, Syria and Libya to help fight the Islamic State militant group by relying on the authority Congress granted President George W. Bush to battle al Qaeda. That same authority would allow Trump to ramp up U.S. deployments in fights against Islamist militants if he chose to do so. One former U.S. intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the president can approve covert action and needs only to brief relevant leaders in Congress once the operation is under way. Trumps powers, however, are limited. He pledged to expand the Army, grow the Marine Corps, boost the Navy from 276 to 350 ships and submarines, and raise the number of Air Force tactical aircraft from 1,100 to 1,200. For starters, that would require that Congress scrap government spending caps under the Budget Control Act. Trumps support for water-boarding, an interrogation technique that simulates drowning, also would meet opposition. Congress last year passed legislation barring the use of waterboarding and other extreme interrogation techniques widely considered torture. Obama signed the measure into law last November.

How Hillary Clinton's white voters melted away,"BETHLEHEM, Pennsylvania (Reuters) - The unraveling of the coalition that was supposed to carry Hillary Clinton to the White House had a lot to do with voters like Jim McAndrew in counties like Northampton, Pennsylvania. McAndrew, 69, a retired steel worker, voted Democrat in every presidential election for half a century. This year he stayed home. And Northampton County, a heavily white, heavily Democratic, largely working class area that backed President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, went for Donald Trump, a Republican. McAndrew, who voted for Obama in the two previous races, was intrigued by Trump, but decided eventually that all he does is insult everybody ... women, black people, white people, rich, poor. Hes an idiot. He considered Clinton, but was concerned by the scandal over her handling of classified material on a private email server as secretary of state. I hated both of them, so I just said, the hell with it, McAndrew said. His wife, also a life-long Democrat, went to the polls without him - and voted Republican.  First time ever, he said. Trumps ability to flip reliably Democratic counties like Northampton helped drive his victory in the presidential election this week. It was critical to his win in Pennsylvania and other Rust Belt states, a bulwark in the Democrats electoral strategy for winning the White House, and it helped fuel his victories in critical swing states, such as Florida and North Carolina. Its not that Trumps economic populism and America First messages generated widespread enthusiasm; he won some of those counties with far fewer votes than Mitt Romney captured as the Republican nominee in 2012. Nationwide, Trumps 59.7 million votes are about 1.2 million behind the 60.9 million Romney got when he lost four years ago, based on initial projections. But Clintons troubles holding on to Democratic voters were far more stark. Some crossed party lines for Trump or backed an independent.  Many just stayed home.  Clinton won the popular vote with 59.9 million votes, 6 million fewer than the 65.9 million Obama won in 2012. And her weakness in traditionally Democratic areas helped cost her the electoral college that chooses the winner of the election. Clinton came across as a status quo candidate unlikely to shake up the Washington establishment, says Mike Sly, 74, a retiree and independent voter in Pinellas County, Florida, who backed Obama in 2012 and voted for Trump this year. Clintons message failed to convince him that she would address his concerns about the state of the economy and rising health insurance premiums under Obamas Affordable Care Act. The race came down to basically what change do I think is going to happen, and how I think it is going to happen, Sly says. I felt that Hillary really carried too much baggage to be trusted. Clintons loss in Florida, a key battleground state, stemmed partly from her inability to hold voters like Sly in white, middle- and working-class areas that previously went Democrat. In vote-rich Pinellas, a beach community popular with retirees in the Tampa Bay region, Trump won 48 percent of the vote, besting Clintons 47 percent. In 2012, Obama won 52 percent. Nationally, initial projections show low voter turnout of just over 55 percent, the worst since the contested election of 2000, when Republican George W. Bush defeated then-Democratic Vice President Al Gore. In Obamas first victory, turnout was more than 62 percent. Clinton beat Trump among black and Hispanic voters, but her effort to forge a winning coalition by leveraging that strength in diverse, urban areas was upended by Trumps strength among whites. Meanwhile, Trump still managed to hold roughly the same level of minority support that Romney got in 2012. The pattern held true not only in rural areas, but also in many suburbs, particularly in the Rust Belt and the South, that tipped towards Obama in the previous two presidential races. It was pretty much a base election, but one group was better at turning out their voters than the other, says Susan MacManus, a University of South Florida political science professor. In Gates County, North Carolina, Trumps vows to crack down on illegal immigration and police Muslim communities for radicalism resonated, says Eric J. Earhart, 49, pastor of the evangelical Upper Room Assembly church. There has been a definite shift over the past eight years away from us being a Judeo-Christian nation, Earhart adds, and many congregants worry about that. The rural county of 12,000 people went for Obama in 2012 with 52 percent of the vote, but it flipped into Trumps column in this years race, giving him 53 percent. Thomas Hill, 38, chairman of the Gates County Republican Party, says voters also were attracted to Trumps blunt speaking and his pledge to bring back manufacturing jobs that went overseas.  Trumps economic message, which included a promise to kill free trade agreements that are unpopular among many working-class voters in industrial areas, also succeeded in Macomb County, Michigan, a predominantly white area north of Detroit. The number of voters casting ballots in the county jumped by more than 14,000 over 2012, and Trump captured 53 percent of the vote to Clintons 42 percent. Four years ago, Obama won the county with just under 52 percent of the vote.  Youve got a lot of blue collar workers here (and) ... a lot of union guys, and they went Republican, says David Phair, 59, a construction worker and Trump voter who didnt cast a ballot in 2012. Theyre tired of politicians. Phair also liked Trumps promise to end illegal immigration. Im looking forward to how hes going to handle illegal aliens. In Pennsylvania, Northampton County and neighboring Lehigh County, once reliant on steel companies, have bounced back from the industrys decline. In Bethlehem, which straddles the two counties, new development has mushroomed around the old steel mill, including a Sands casino resort with 2,400 employees.  E-commerce companies, white collar firms and big corporations, such as Olympus, the Japanese imaging giant, have also  moved to the region. Lehigh and Northampton counties have a larger share of households than the state as a whole that earn more than $75,000, about 36 percent. All that suggests ripe country for Clinton. But the counties also are whiter and older than the country as a whole.  And Trump dominated voting among older whites. Around the table where McAndrew has a weekly poker game in the basement of the United Steel Workers office in Bethlehem, the retired men of the citys steel mills have different opinions on why Clinton failed to match Obamas success in the region. But they agree that she didnt offer a compelling message. Among the five at the table, all lifelong Democrats, only three cast votes for Clinton. She was going to continue everything the way it is and a lot of people think there are things that need to be changed, says Ken Rayden, 80, who voted for Clinton, but mainly out of party loyalty. She didnt show the people anything new. ",politicsNews,"November 10, 2016 ",1
Pollsters who predicted Trump win benefit from industry's miss,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A handful of small public opinion polling companies that bucked consensus and accurately called the U.S. presidential election for Republican Donald Trump are reporting being flooded with calls from investors and clients seeking their services.  Most pollsters wrongly forecast Democrat Hillary Clinton as leading Trump ahead of Tuesdays election in the latest fiasco to hit the $20 billion public opinion research industry, only months after it failed to predict the British vote to leave the European Union in a June referendum. Among the few that got it right was a new industry player using a different method, South African firm Brandseye, which analyzes social media posts. With offices in Capetown and Johannesburg, Brandseye took an entirely different approach from traditional polling. The data-miner pays people around the world to sift through social media for relevant posts, a process known as crowd-sourcing, and then uses a computer algorithm to rate consumer sentiment about products or politicians.  Its method pointed to a Trump victory. It also correctly called Britains Brexit vote. My phone has not stopped, CEO and part owner JP Kloppers said in a telephone interview on Thursday. Kloppers said venture capitalists have been calling about investing in the firm, and polling companies have inquired about its methods. Kloppers said the company was open to licensing its technology. Existing clients include ride-sharing firm Uber, banks, telecommunications firms and some government agencies, he said. He declined to identify the governments. Elections come every couple of years, but there are companies and governments that need to understand every day and every week whats driving customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction, Kloppers said. New methods, if successful, are of high interest to polling companies that are having difficulty reaching cellphone users or survey-weary Americans.  The answer is ongoing research, said Krista Jenkins, director of the PublicMind survey research center at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey. Its basically digging in as an industry and comparing the findings from your traditional telephone polls to data that is collected online. Traditional pollsters base their results on questions posed to randomly selected people, often in interviews conducted live over the telephone. Among other errors that pollsters made ahead of the U.S election, they almost universally miscalculated how turnout would be distributed among demographic groups. High-profile London-based polling agency YouGov PLCs stock dropped 4 percent on Wednesday after its new method of surveying people online failed to accurately predict the U.S. presidential elections outcome. Analysts were split on the reason behind the drop, and YouGov stock partly recovered on Thursday, closing up 2 percent in London trading.  No one from YouGov, which primarily does research for corporations, was immediately available to comment on the business implications of the polling miss, a spokesman said. The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project gave Clinton a 90 percent probability of winning the 270 electoral votes needed to secure the election. On its website, one of the possible scenarios was how Trump could win the election by adjusting turnout levels. Ipsos SA will assess what it got wrong, said Clifford Young, president of the French research companys U.S. public affairs unit. Election polling is generally not a big money-maker. Many polls are done by universities or the media, while private research companies use it to market themselves to corporate clients that provide more profitable work. Pioneering U.S. pollster Gallup last year abandoned head-to-head polls for the presidential race, saying it wanted to focus its resources on polls about issues. The outfits that wrongly foresaw a Clinton victory will suffer damage to their reputation, said Alex DeGroote, a London-based analyst at Peel Hunt LLP who follows the industry. They attach their brand to these polls. If these polls continue to flop, its not going to help their brand credibility, DeGroote said. Among this years winners may be Remington Research Group. The Kansas City, Missouri-based pollster correctly predicted that Trump would win the election battleground states of Florida, North Carolina and Ohio, although it missed Trumps surprising Wisconsin victory. The company, which frequently works with Republican politicians, conducts a mix of automated phone interviews and live phone interviews. It may have done relatively well because other firms were afraid of standing out from the crowd, said Titus Bond, the groups director. A lot of pollsters, they want to be at the same number as everyone else, Bond said. Bond said he received three calls on the morning after the election from corporate clients in the pharmaceutical and fertilizer industries and three others from advocacy groups, all seeking to do business.

Trump outreach to Dimon for Treasury job may fall on deaf ears,"(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon did not support Republican Donald Trumps presidential campaign, yet some Trump advisers want Americas most famous banker to become Treasury Secretary to calm nerves on Wall Street. A member of Trumps transition team contacted Dimon recently to see if he would be interested in the role, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. It was not clear whether Dimon had responded, though he has said emphatically multiple times that he was not interested in the role. JPMorgan spokesman Andrew Gray declined to comment, and Dimon, who is traveling outside the United States, could not be reached. Trumps close circle of advisers includes several with Wall Street ties. His campaign finance manager, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker. Fundraiser Anthony Scaramucci is a hedge fund executive. A person familiar with Trumps personnel efforts said the transition teams list included Dimon, Mnuchin and Rep. Jeb Hensarling. The person said that Mnuchin was a more likely choice given his proximity to Trump. Trumps controversial rhetoric and behavior during the campaign concerning immigrants, women, minorities, the disabled, Muslims and China, among other things, were offensive to many senior Wall Street executives who have tried to embrace inclusion, diversity and globalization. Trump also criticized Wall Street on the trail, saying the industry got away with murder and would not be let off the hook. Since being elected on Tuesday, Trump has softened his tone and tried to bridge gaps by meeting with President Obama and taking calls from foreign officials. Bringing Dimon on board could help him mend fences with the financial industry, which appears to be coming around to the idea of Trump in the White House. At an event on Thursday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc CEO Lloyd Blankfein said Trump could be good for the economy and Dimon would be an excellent choice for Treasury Secretary, while hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said Trumps advisers would get the best and brightest to run the economy. Hensarlings office indicated in a statement that he did not want the job. Serving in his Cabinet is not something Ive indicated an interest in and its not something I am pursuing, the statement said. He said he looked forward to working in Congress to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act which tightened regulations on Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis. Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has been floated as a possible candidate for roles like Treasury Secretary in the past. However, resentment toward bankers following the 2007-2009 financial crisis made his candidacy much less likely, as did JPMorgan-specific scandals related to a costly derivatives trade and bad mortgages. A $13 billion mortgage settlement JPMorgan reached with the federal government in 2013 prompted Trump then to call Dimon the worst banker in the United States. However, Dimon has managed to retain a reputation within the banking industry as a distinguished leader, in part by the way he handled those scandals and the way he talks about JPMorgans role in society as the largest U.S. bank. For instance, Dimon decided to have JPMorgan make big investments in Detroit, calling it a civic duty to turn around an economically challenged city. His memos, speeches and letters to shareholders are often sprinkled with patriotic language. America is best when we come together with clear leadership, expertise and the political will to take on difficult challenges and get things done, the 60-year-old chairman and CEO said in a memo to JPMorgan Chase employees following Tuesdays election. No one should ever doubt the strength and resilience of our country and our democracy. However, Dimon has said as recently as September that he would not want a role as Treasury Secretary. If he holds to that, it could put him and JPMorgan in an awkward position. Saying no to a presidential request to join the cabinet is unusual, and the bank would then be overseen by appointees from an administration Dimon rejected. Even so, his associates do not expect Dimon to say yes.  Dimon has said his determination to act would make it hard to make political compromises. Talking before an audience in September, he said the only job in government he would want is the one Trump is about to get. I would love to be president of the United States of America, Dimon told the Economic Club of Washington. Until Donald Trump got to where he was, they said youll never see a rich businessman whos never been in politics be president. I clearly was wrong about that. ",politicsNews,"November 10, 2016 ",1

Obama asks for $11.6 billion more in supplemental defense budget,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday sent a request to Congress for an additional $11.6 billion in supplemental war-related funding, which would include money to fight Islamic State militants and sustain high overseas troop levels. The request, detailed in a letter released by the White House, seeks an additional $5.8 billion for the Pentagon for military operations in Afghanistan and fighting Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and an $5.8 billion for the State Department and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for fiscal 2017. Obama made the request just before Congress returns to Washington for its lame duck session before the new Congress starts in January. For the Department of Defense, this plan reflects the evolving nature of our military campaign against ISIL and our efforts in Afghanistan, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said in a statement, using an acronym for Islamic State.  Carter added that the funding would also allow the State Department and USAID to counter extremism. Swift passage of this plan will help the Department of Defense and our partners in the U.S. government and around the world protect this nation, and I urge Congress to support it, the statement said.  U.S. Representative Mac Thornberry, the chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said he would review President Barack Obamas request but that it was too low. While we will review the request carefully, the amount still does not accommodate the increased pace of operations against ISIL and does nothing to begin addressing the readiness crisis, Thornberry said in a statement.

Judge tells Trump University litigants they would be wise to settle,"SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - The U.S. judge overseeing a lawsuit against President-elect Donald Trump and his Trump University told both sides they would be wise to settle the case given all else thats involved. Lawyers for the president-elect are squaring off against students who claim they were they were lured by false promises to pay up to $35,000 to learn Trumps real estate investing secrets from his hand-picked instructors. Earlier on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel tentatively rejected a bid by Trump to keep a wide range of statements from the presidential campaign out of the fraud trial. Trump owned 92 percent of Trump University and had control over all major decisions, the students court papers say. The president-elect denies the allegations and has argued that he relied on others to manage the business.  Trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 28, and Curiel told lawyers he was not inclined to delay the six-year-old case further. Trump lawyer Daniel Petrocelli said he would ask to put the trial on hold until early next year, in light of the many tasks the magnate has before his inauguration. Curiel said he would allow both sides to file briefs on whether to delay the case. He also indicated they should consider making a deal.  It would be wise for the plaintiffs, for the defendants, to look closely at trying to resolve this case given all else thats involved, Curiel said. Petrocelli told reporters after the hearing that Trump might have to be a little more flexible about settling the case now that he is president-elect, although the lawyer wasnt sure his client would was willing. Curiel said that he would allow Trump to testify via video given his presidential obligations.  In the tentative ruling Curiel, based in San Diego, said Trumps lawyers can renew objections to specific campaign statements and evidence during trial. Trumps attorneys had argued that jurors should not hear about statements Trump made during the campaign, including about Curiel himself. Trump attacked the judge as biased against him. He claimed Curiel, who was born in Indiana but is of Mexican descent, could not be impartial because of Trumps pledge to build a wall between the United States and Mexico.  Trumps lawyers argued that Curiel should bar from the trial accusations about Trumps personal conduct including alleged sexual misconduct, his taxes and corporate bankruptcies, along with speeches and tweets. They argued the information is irrelevant to the jury and prejudicial to the case.  In court papers, lawyers for the students claimed that Trumps statements would help jurors as they weigh the Republicans credibility. Defendants have not identified specific evidence that they wish to exclude, Curiel wrote on Thursday. Accordingly, the court declines to issue a blanket ruling at this time. The judge also barred Trump lawyers from telling jurors that the university had a 98 percent approval rate on student evaluations. That rating is irrelevant as to whether Trump University misrepresented itself, Curiel wrote. Curiel is presiding over two cases against Trump and the university. A separate lawsuit by New Yorks attorney general is pending. ",politicsNews,"November 10, 2016 ",1

Glitch briefly removes 'Muslim ban' proposal from Trump website,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some of the most controversial proposals Donald Trump made while running for U.S. president disappeared from his campaign website on Thursday, but a spokesman said what some observers took as a softening of Trumps policies was due to a technical glitch. The link to Trumps Dec. 7 proposal titled: Donald J. Trump statement on Preventing Muslim Immigration, in which he called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States vanished temporarily from the website but later reappeared. So too did a list of Trumps potential Supreme Court justice picks as president and certain details of his economic, defense and regulatory reform plans. The website was temporarily redirecting all specific press release pages to the home page, Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said in an email.  Links to Trumps policy proposals, including the Muslim ban, were working again by 3:30 p.m. EST (2030 GMT). The links, which had redirected readers to a campaign fundraising page, appeared to have been removed around Election Day on Tuesday, when Trump won a historic upset against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, according to a website that records historic snapshots of web pages. In an appearance on CNBC on Thursday, Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal praised Trump for removing the Muslim ban proposal from his website and also said Trump had deleted statements offensive to Muslims from his Twitter account. The prince could not be reached for comment after the links were restored. Several tweets attacking Muslims that Trump sent while campaigning for president remained in his feed on Thursday,  including a March 22 tweet in which Trump wrote:  Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in. No way! After initially praising the removal of the Muslim ban proposal at a news conference with other civil rights leaders on Thursday, Samer Khalaf, president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said in a follow-up interview the group was hoping to see better behavior from Trump. False hope just came over us, Khalaf said, but we didnt really think it was monumental that they took down the language. Khalaf said Trumps policies were more important than any statements. Hes elected, he said some horrible things, now we have to see what his policies are. If theyre good policies were going to commend him for it. If theyre horrible policies were going to challenge him on it. Despite the temporary glitch, most of Trumps core policy positions had remained on his website, including his central immigration promise to build an impenetrable physical wall on the border with Mexico and make Mexico pay for its construction. It was not the first time the Trump campaign blamed technical difficulties for changes to its website. The campaign this year also replaced the part of the site describing Trumps healthcare policy with a different version. When contacted about it by Reuters in September, the campaign put the original page back up. ",politicsNews,"November 10, 2016 ",1
Ex-congressman indicted on 24 counts in spending scandal,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A former U.S. representative whose lavish office in Washington raised questions about use of taxpayer dollars was indicted on Thursday on charges of defrauding the federal government and campaign committees and attempting to cover it up, according to court documents.  Aaron Schock, a 35-year-old former Republican congressman from Illinois, was indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice on 24 counts, including wire fraud, theft of government funds and filing false federal income tax returns. Schock maintained his innocence on Thursday before the indictment was announced.  Neither I nor anyone else intentionally did anything wrong, he said in a statement. As I have said before, we might have made errors among a few of the thousands and thousands of financial transactions we conducted, but they were honest mistakes  no one intended to break any law.  Schocks position in public office did not put him above the law, the Department of Justice said.  These charges allege that Mr. Schock deliberately and repeatedly violated federal law, to his personal and financial advantage, Jim Lewis, U.S. attorney for the Central District of Illinois, said in a statement on Thursday.  Mr. Schock held public office at the time of the alleged offenses, but public office does not exempt him or anyone else from accountability for alleged intentional misuse of public funds and campaign funds. Schock, elected to the, U.S. House of Representatives in 2008 at the age of 27, gained a following for posting flashy photos on social media of himself traveling around the world.  But he was hounded with questions after The Washington Post reported last year about lavish decorations in his Capitol Hill office based on the PBS period melodrama Downton Abbey.  Although staff told the Post that the interior design work had been done for free, the story prompted more investigations into Schocks spending habits, with several media outlets reporting he failed to disclose some expenditures and had to repay others after improperly using taxpayer funds. On Thursday, Schock said before the indictment that his faith in the Justice Department had been eroded.        This indictment will look bad, but underneath it is just made-up allegations of criminal activity arising from unintentional administrative errors, George Terwilliger III, Schocks attorney, said in a statement prior to the indictment.   A summons will be issued to Schock by the U.S. Clerk of the  Court for an arraignment date in Springfield, Illinois. ",politicsNews,"November 10, 2016 ",1

The governments goal is for more than 13.8 million sign-ups initially. Trump has said that he plans to repeal Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. Insurers have said that 2017 Obamacare plans will remain in place and that any changes would affect 2018 plans. Earnest said that people should not worry about what could happen to the healthcare exchanges under the Trump administration. These are benefits that are available to them today. We certainly would encourage people to sign up and capitalize on the good opportunity thats there, he said. Obama met with Trump on Thursday for the first time in a one-on-one, 90-minute meeting in the White House Oval Office.    Trump also released a review of his goals to overhaul healthcare on his website, reiterating that he would repeal the Affordable Care Act. Trumps pledge to repeal Obamacare may not be easy. He does not have the votes in Congress for an outright repeal and will have to cut away at its financing first, health policy experts say. ",politicsNews,"November 10, 2016 ",1
'Rage against the machine': U.S. voters reject a 'rigged' system," (This November 9th story has been refiled to clarify that Keyes comment in 3rd paragraph from end was said in jest) By Andy Sullivan and Michelle Conlin WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a bitterly divisive presidential election, at least one thing united U.S. voters: a feeling that the countrys economic and political systems were tilted against them. A Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll of 45,000 voters found an electorate burning with resentment against Wall Street, politicians and the news media, increasingly alienated from a country that is changing in ways it doesnt like. This sense of alienation transcended partisan boundaries, uniting supporters of Republican victor Donald Trump and his  Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. This is rage against the machine, said Carrie Sheridan, a former supporter of Democratic President Barack Obama, as fellow Trump supporters celebrated the real-estate moguls victory early Wednesday by pouring champagne on each other at his $200 million luxury hotel near the White House. Some 75 percent of poll respondents, Republicans and Democrats alike, agreed that the country needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful.  Seven out of ten agreed that the economy is rigged to benefit wealthy insiders. Most backed the notion that their leaders were out of touch: 77 percent of Trump supporters and 56 percent of Clinton supporters agreed that traditional politicians didnt care about people like them. (Graphic of Reuters/Ipsos poll: tmsnrt.rs/2ffJJ9A)  This sense of disconnection ran deepest among Trump supporters. Some 73 percent agreed with the idea that more and more, I dont identify with what America has become, while 61 percent said they felt like strangers in their own country. Most Clinton supporters said they didnt share those sentiments. Nine out of ten Trump supporters said mainstream media is more interested in making money than telling the truth.  Trump, who travels in his own 757 jet, might seem like an unlikely candidate to benefit from this anti-elite sentiment.  But by 8 p.m. Eastern time, lines had formed at the velvet ropes by 8 p.m. Eastern time outside Trumps new hotel in between the White House and the U.S. Capitol, where a steak costs $60 and wine is sold by the spoonful.  These are shadow voters, voters who have never voted before, said Preston Parry, 20, who was watching the results with a throng of friends, all of them wearing suits and Trump campaign trucker hats. Despite his gilded lifestyle, Trump capitalized on working-class fears of a rapidly changing country. Styling himself as a blue-collar billionaire, he promised to bring back manufacturing jobs back to forgotten factory towns and sharply curtail immigration.  He drew overwhelming support from white working-class voters in Rust Belt states like Ohio and Pennsylvania, winning enough states to capture the White House even as he lost the popular vote. Trumps scathing characterization of Clinton as a corrupt career politician also resonated in an year when many voters said they were primarily casting a vote against one of the candidates. Some 46 percent of Trump supporters said they backed him because they didnt want Clinton to win, while 40 percent of Clinton supporters said they were motivated primarily to stop Trump from reaching the White House.  Those who made up their minds in the last week of the campaign were more likely to cite opposition to one of the candidates as their main reason for voting. Politicians like Clinton are taking away from what we were as a country and saying we should change because of the people coming in, the immigrants and refugees, said John Scherer, a 57-year-old former maintenance worker in Portsmouth, Ohio. Scherers sentiments were widely shared by Trump supporters, as 72 percent agreed with the idea that immigrants threaten traditional American beliefs and customs. Three-quarters of Clinton backers, by contrast, said immigrants strengthened U.S. society. The Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states, including more than 45,000 people who already voted in the presidential election. Voter dissatisfaction isnt exactly new. Surveys have consistently found since 2002 that most people believe the country is on the wrong track, a period that encompasses a Republican and Democratic president, two wars, a deep recession and a slow recovery. Trump supporters were more likely to share this frustration. Some 70 percent who backed the Republican real-estate mogul said they felt the country was on the wrong track, while only 23 percent of Clinton supporters agreed, according to the Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll. Those figures could quickly turn on their head as the reality of a Trump presidency sinks in. Across the country, Clinton supporters used unusually harsh language when describing the election result.  In Washington, D.C., non-profit manager Trisha Postyuk said she saw her vote for Clinton as a triumph over evil.  In St. Petersburg, Florida, cafe owner Amanda Keyes, 33, said racist and sexist attitudes are going to take many years to overcome. Misogyny will continue to bubble through the country but I can only hope that the old people will die, she said jokingly. At Trumps hotel, a couple from Atlanta looked at a text message from a friend who had bet them $100 that Trump would lose.  Please dont ever text me again, the message said.

Trump's foreign policy approach almost same as that of Putin: Kremlin,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Thursday U.S. President-elect Donald Trumps foreign policy approach was phenomenally close to that of President Vladimir Putin, giving Russia hope that tattered U.S.-Russia relations could gradually be improved. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, speaking in New York, said he saw incredible similarities between the two mens foreign policy ideas, and this meant there was a solid basis to start a meaningful dialogue between Moscow and Washington.          Peskov, in the United States for a chess tournament, said he was struck by how similar parts of Trumps victory speech were to a speech Putin gave in southern Russia last month.  Both men said they would put their own countrys national interests first, but that they would be ready to develop ties with other nations, depending on how ready other countries were to deepen relations themselves. They (Putin and Trump) set out the same main foreign policy principles and that is incredible, Peskov said in comments broadcast by Russian state TVs Channel One on Thursday evening. It is phenomenal how close they are to one another when it comes to their conceptual approach to foreign policy. And that is probably a good basis for our moderate optimism that they will at least be able to start a dialogue to start to clear out the Augean stables in our bilateral relations.  With Moscow and Washington now at odds over Syria, Ukraine and NATO, Peskov cautioned that it would take a long time before relations could return to a high level, however, because of how far they had been allowed to deteriorate. An atmosphere of mutual trust takes years to achieve, he said. Its not possible to just declare that there is an atmosphere of mutual trust, especially after such serious damage was done in the last few years to our relations. Peskov told the TASS news agency separately that Putin was ready to be flexible when it came to mending ties which he wanted to improve, but that there was a limit to his flexibility and that he would need to see some U.S. reciprocity. Peskov spoke after one of Russias most senior diplomats told the Interfax news agency earlier on Thursday that the Russian government had been in touch with members of Trumps political team during the U.S. election campaign and knew most of his entourage.

Trump's business empire poses unprecedented potential conflicts of interest,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump campaigned for president as a savvy billionaire who would apply his business acumen to improving the U.S. economy, cutting taxes for Americans and negotiating better trade deals. But his vast, complicated network of businesses under the Trump Organization, including numerous foreign investments and debts, could create unprecedented conflicts of interest when he takes the oath of office as U.S. president in January, government ethics experts said.  Federal law does not prohibit the president from being involved in private business while in office, even though members of Congress and lower-ranking executive branch officials are subject to strict conflict-of-interest rules. Lyndon Johnson, for instance, quietly managed his broadcasting businesses despite insisting publicly that he had ceased all involvement, according to his biographer, Robert Caro. There are no legal restrictions, no legal requirements, said Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of the nonpartisan watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. But most presidents in recent decades have voluntarily placed their personal assets, including property and financial holdings, in blind trusts overseen by independent advisers to avoid any appearance of impropriety, experts said. Under a blind trust, the owner has no say or knowledge in how the assets are managed. President Barack Obama was one exception, but his investments are mostly in broad-based index funds and U.S. Treasury notes with little chance of conflicts. Trumps businesses include licensing deals, hotels and golf courses around the world. During the campaign, he filed a 104-page financial disclosure statement, as required by law, that showed he had financial interests in more than 500 entities with names like China Trademark LLC and DT Marks Qatar LLC but had few details. While plenty of wealthy men have been president, no one has ascended to the White House with such a complex array of assets. Trumps spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on how he planned to manage his businesses while he was in the White House. During the campaign, Trump did say he would likely transfer day-to-day operations to his children. But experts in government ethics said that would do little to insulate Trump. That presumably frees some time up for him to be the president, but it doesnt do anything to clear the conflicts of interest, said Kenneth Gross, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer who has counseled high-ranking political appointees on ethics laws. His familys interests, his childrens interests, are co-existent with his own. The nature of Trumps businesses, Gross said, makes a blind trust all but meaningless  even if he were inclined to shift control of his empire from his family, an idea he has rejected. Gross advised Michael Bloomberg, a New York billionaire businessman, when he became mayor of New York City. Bloomberg stepped away from day-to-day operations at his data and media company, Bloomberg LP, and donated all terminals that were used by city agencies to avoid any impression of profiting from public funds. Some of the potential problems for the Republican president-elect are obvious. One of his latest ventures, a luxury hotel in Washington just blocks from the White House, leases its property from the U.S. government, putting Trump on both sides of any landlord-tenant disputes. Others are more opaque. Trump has licensing deals and diverse real estate holdings in numerous countries that could benefit from foreign government subsidies or tax breaks. Companies in which he holds an interest owe hundreds of millions of dollars in debt to foreign banks that are subject to U.S. regulations, such as Deutsche Bank and Bank of China, according to the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. His properties include hotels in countries like Turkey, Uruguay, the Philippines and South Korea, and golf courses in the United Arab Emirates, Ireland and Britain.   Conflicts of interest could stem, for example, from countries trying to influence policies by doing business with any of his companies or even his children. His daughter Ivanka has a line of fashion products, which along with other Trump-branded items are made in countries like China. Trump has accused China of currency manipulation and threatened to put tariffs on its imports. Trumps opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, faced criticism during the campaign over the Clinton Foundation, the charity founded by her husband, former President Bill Clinton. That was despite an ethics agreement that Hillary Clinton signed in 2009 in order to become Obamas secretary state that was designed to ensure donors could not sway U.S. foreign policy. Under the deal, the State Department was allowed to review any new contributions from foreign governments. Unlike Clinton, however, Trump is not answerable to anyone else as president. And he has already shown himself willing to blur the lines between campaigning and marketing, holding events at his own properties and touting his companies during speeches.  Given the high-profile properties that bear his name, a blind trust would do little to help his case, experts said. You cant put a golf course in a blind trust; it would be pointless, said Robert Kelner, a Washington lawyer and an expert on government ethics. The idea behind a blind trust is that its blind  you dont know what assets are held. The only unassailable solution, experts said, would be for Trump to sell off his businesses and place the proceeds in a blind trust. With no legal requirements, Trumps actions as president are only subject to the will of the voters or to built-in checks and balances like Congressional oversight.  The potential for conflicts is exacerbated by the lack of publicly known details about Trumps holdings. Even his net worth is unclear. Trump has boasted of more than $10 billion in wealth, but financial magazines have estimated his fortune at less than half that. He has refused to release his tax returns, breaking with decades of presidential campaign tradition, and legal experts said he is under no obligation to do so as president. His dealings with foreign governments are thus largely unknown. He will likely face scrutiny of policy decisions that affect countries where he is known to have business interests, said Bookbinder.

"Investors, economists brace for new dangerous game: parsing Trump's words","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Move over, Janet Yellen. The Federal Reserve chief has a challenger for the title of speaker most scrutinized by Wall Street, and its Donald Trump.  All new U.S. President-elects are closely monitored by the financial community for clues about what their policies mean for markets. But Trumps speaking style, often using enthymemes or incomplete sentences that leave room for interpretation, along with vague or contradictory campaign promises make him all the more challenging to decipher.  His statements are crazy. He says peculiar things, like building the wall and getting Mexico to pay for it, that you know are just not going to happen, said Allan Meltzer, a Fed historian and professor of political economy at Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburg.  But his actions as opposed to his statements have been very moderate, he said. Exhibit A for how Trump has policy makers and investors hanging on his every word came shortly after the Republicans conciliatory acceptance speech early Wednesday. Bonds fell and stocks gained as investors placed tentative bets that Trumps somewhat vague platform of economic stimulus would translate into corporate profits and higher inflation. The stakes are high. With a Republican controlled House and Senate, Trump has the opportunity to use his time in office to radically reshape the American economy.  He has pledged dramatic tax cuts, infrastructure spending and economic deregulation, and wants to repeal Obamacare. These measures he says will turbo-charge growth and help boost the wages of those who have lost out in a globalized world where middle-class jobs have been squeezed. With the U.S. budget deficit at just 3.2 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 9.8 percent in 2009, and near record low interest rates, Trump has room to undertake a large-scale fiscal boost, at least in the short term.  His restrained acceptance speech hinted that infrastructure was a priority. Trump said he would rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals (and) our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. On the campaign trail, Trumps speeches were full of superlatives and unfinished thoughts that only complicated matters for traders and economic policy watchers. These enthymemes are a rhetorical device at the heart of a persuasive speaking style that has helped catapult the billionaire to the White House. Trying to parse his words is one thing. Actually putting money to work quickly base on them brings far more risk than usual, according to Brian Shapiro, CEO of SPAG Funds, a small global macro hedge fund manager based in New York.  I wont react to it, but the world will, he said. I think people will have a heart attack if they react to every word. Economic advisory firm Fathom Consulting dubbed the election outcome Trump Lite: a world in which as President-elect he would be unwilling or unable to enact some of his more extreme policies such as building a wall at the Mexico border, mass deportations of immigrants and wide-ranging protectionist measures. Markets are waiting to see if we are going to have the campaign Trump who spoke in rhetoric, or Trump the president who is going to be more pragmatic in his approach, said Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies. Economists and fund managers, as well as the Feds policymakers, are looking to see which issues Trump will prioritize. So far, indications are he would pursue tax cuts, additional military spending, and revamping President Barack Obamas Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, speaking to reporters as Americans voted on Tuesday, said he would try to figure out whether or not the new presidents fiscal policies would be more simulative, about the same, or worse, adding the level of market volatility would provide a clue.  Trump has no defined economic team. It is unclear whether he will follow the lead of say Peter Navarro, a professor at the University of California at Irvine, whose studies suggest a tougher trade stance against China; or whether he could cleave to Wall Street allies such as former Goldman Sachs alumnus Steven Mnuchin, who has been mooted by Trump as a potential Treasury Secretary. Trumps fiscal plan as it stands is pretty vague and it doesnt add up, said Paul Ashworth, Toronto-based chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. We expect some fiscal plan that will pursue the Republican agenda, but its likely to be much smaller in scale than the one originally envisaged by Trump.  While these policy questions are expected to persist even after Trump succeeds Obama in January, the nature of the Trump cabinet appointments and the tone of their confirmation hearings will either ease or amplify the uncertainty premium in the markets, wrote Steven Ricchiuto, U.S. chief economist at Mizuho.   Beyond Navarro and Mnuchin, all eyes will be on whether many of the conservative economists, like Columbia University business school dean Glenn Hubbard, who abandoned Trump during a divisive campaign could ultimately return as advisors.  Yet the reality-TV-host-turned-president-elect has struggled in the past to maintain the measured tone shown in his victory speech. During his campaign, for example, Trump appeared to suggest the United States could renegotiate its debts to obtain a better deal, a comment he quickly rowed back upon.  His past criticisms of Yellen as someone who should be ashamed of her policy actions, and comments that she was keeping interest rates low for political reasons, could roil markets if repeated during his wait to take office in January.  He has managed to keep it under control some of the time, Meltzer said. Whether he will be able to do that as president will very much determine whether he is successful.

Former Los Angeles Mayor Villaraigosa enters California governor race,"(Reuters) - Former Los Angeles Mayor and former California State Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa on Thursday publicly launched his campaign to become the next governor of the countrys most populous state. With a new campaign website, the Democrat said his main focuses if elected would be investing in schools, repairing infrastructure around the state and shoring up an ailing middle class. He said his campaign would stand in direct contrast to that of President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican who campaigned heavily on building a wall between the United States and Mexico and deporting undocumented immigrants. Trump won the presidency in a surprise upset against Democrat Hillary Clinton earlier this week. We are a state that builds bridges, not walls. We are inclusive. We celebrate our diversity. And we welcome newcomers, Villaraigosa said in a statement on his campaign website. We know the answer to fear is hope. The answer to division is unity. Villaraigosa, who was Los Angeles mayor from 2005 to 2013 and served as speaker of the California Assembly from 1998 to 2000, is perhaps the states highest-profile Latino leader.  Villaraigosa in June said he had formed a political action committee and started raising money to help fight Trumps presidential campaign in key states with large Latino immigrant populations. Californias Democratic Lieutenant Governor and former San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom said in early 2015 that he would also run for the states top political position. The two are currently the leading entrants in the race to fill the seat of the popular Governor Jerry Brown, who will be 81 when his term ends. ",politicsNews,"November 10, 2016 ",1

Trump promised to repeal Obamacare. Now what?,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican President-elect Donald Trump vowed on the campaign trail to repeal Obamacare, but making good on that promise may be easier said than done. President Barack Obamas 2010 national healthcare reform law extended medical insurance to 25 million more people by expanding the Medicaid plan for the poor and creating subsidized coverage for individuals. Republican lawmakers, who have voted more than 50 times to repeal all or part of the law, have begun pressing Trump to deliver. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday repealing Obamacare is a pretty high item on our agenda for the new Congress. But a complete repeal of Obamas Affordable Care Act may not be immediately in the cards, as Republican lawmakers now hold 51 seats in the Senate at latest count, well short of the 60 seats required to overturn it. Instead, health policy experts said, Trump could try to dismantle key elements through a process called budget reconciliation. That would allow him to eliminate funding for the income-based subsidies that make the new insurance plans affordable, or cut the money providing expanded Medicaid benefits in 31 states. Some of the policy experts on the Republican side would say tearing it up and starting over would be very disruptive, said Paul Howard, director of health policy at the conservative Manhattan Institute. Parts of the law have been weakened through legal challenges. Several of the largest U.S. health insurers have pulled out of the exchanges for individual coverage after losing money on a sicker-than-expected group of patients. Consumers not eligible for government subsidies have seen premiums rise sharply, including a projected average increase of 25 percent for 2017. Scrapping the law altogether without a clear plan for providing replacement coverage for so many people would be politically risky, experts said.  Trump also would face a tight deadline were he to try to dismantle the insurance exchanges by 2018; many state-based health insurance regulators require insurers to submit plans for the upcoming year by April or May - only a few months into a new administration. Trump also could seek changes to other provisions of the law, such as a tax on medical device makers, or the so-called Cadillac tax that is due to hit rich employer-based healthcare plans in 2020. However, some elements could not be eliminated by depriving the law of funds. For instance, the law prevents insurers from denying coverage to people based on their health or pricing insurance based on gender. Mandatory coverage of preventive benefits also would be unaffected - short of a complete repeal. It also is not clear if Trump would try to reverse the individual mandate, which requires people to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty. The goal of the requirement was to broaden the pool of policyholders to include more healthy Americans. Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said on Thursday at a New York Times Dealbook conference that some elements of the law are so popular that they are likely to continue, even if there is something Trump calls repeal. They include allowing young adults to stay on their parents plans and people with health problems to buy insurance without paying more. Medicaid could continue to expand, he said, though with a different type of federal financing. Trumps surprise victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton rattled healthcare investors on Wednesday, depressing shares in hospital operators and some insurers. Medicaid focused health insurer Molina Healthcare Inc. fell nearly 16 percent, and hospital chain Tenet Healthcare Corp dropped 25 percent. Large insurers, who have been losing money on the exchanges, gained, with Anthem Inc. up 1.5 percent. Enrollment opened on Nov. 1 for 2017 coverage and once those plans are purchased, it would be legally difficult for Trump to cancel them before the one-year contracts run out, said Molina Healthcare Chief Executive Officer Dr. Mario Molina. Any changes they make will have to be on a prospective basis to begin in 2018, Molina said. Its not clear what Trumps plan to replace Obamacare would look like. Options he raised on the campaign trail include replacing the Obamacare individual coverage with high-deductible healthcare plans, and lumping the sickest people together into high-risk pools that are insured separately. I think there is going to be a lot of confusion and a lot of anxious people, Molina said. Among the worries for some people covered under Obamacare is how long it will last. Before the law took effect, Marc Dobin, a 57-year old mediator and lawyer in Jupiter, Florida, said his insurer put a surcharge on his premium because he has heart stents. Under Obamacare, insurers are barred from charging more for pre-existing conditions. Imagine the disaster if, part way through the year, they cancel it, Dobin said. For others, the cost of premiums bolstered their support for Trump. Crista Simmons, 63, a piano teacher in Kalamazoo, Michigan, spends about a third of her gross income on premiums and medical care. There are people who pay more in premiums than their mortgage, she said. ",politicsNews,"November 10, 2016 ",1

Bertolini, speaking at the New York Times Dealbook conference, said he expects the expansion of Medicaid to more people will continue but with new mechanisms for federal financing. He also sees some sort of subsidies for individual insurance remaining.

Trump could pull out of global climate accord in a year: lawyers,"MARRAKESH, Morocco (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could use legal short-cuts to pull out of a global agreement for fighting climate change within a year, keeping a campaign promise and by-passing a theoretical four-year wait, lawyers say. Trump, who has called global warming a hoax and said it was invented by the Chinese to undermine U.S. manufacturing, has said he wants to cancel the 2015 Paris Agreement among almost 200 nations that entered into force on Nov. 4. The accord, which seeks to phase out greenhouse gas emissions this century with a shift from fossil fuels, says in its Article 28 that any country wanting to pull out after joining up has to wait four years. In theory, the earliest date for withdrawal is Nov. 4, 2020, around the time of the next U.S. presidential election. But Trump could pull out of the parent treaty of the Paris Agreement, the 1992 U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change with just a years notice, also voiding U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement, U.N. legal experts say. That would be controversial, partly because the Convention was signed by former Republican president George Bush in 1992 and approved by the U.S. Senate. It would also severely strain relations with many foreign nations. Meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco, for two weeks of talks to work out ways to implement pledges for action in the Paris Agreement, many countries have reaffirmed support for the 195-nation accord since Trumps election victory on Tuesday. If Trump withdraws from the Paris Agreement there would be a political cost. If he pulls out of the Convention the cost would be greater, said Daniel Bodansky, a professor of the Arizona State University Sandra Day OConnor College of Law. It would be going nuclear. It would signal that the United States has no interest in cooperating with other nations on climate change, said Alden Meyer, of the Union of Concerned Scientists. The Convention sets a goal of avoiding dangerous man-made damage to the climate to avert more heat waves, downpours, floods, extinctions of animals and plants and rising sea levels.  The Paris Agreement is much more explicit, seeking to phase out net greenhouse gas emissions by the second half of the century and limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. Trump wants to safeguard jobs in the U.S. coal and oil industries, saying the Paris Agreement would undermine the U.S. economy. He said in May: Were going to cancel the Paris climate agreement. But the accord has since entered into force in international law. As of Thursday it had been ratified by 103 nations representing 73 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Trump could also pull out from Paris immediately if the Republican-controlled House and Senate passed a law asking him to do so, Bodansky said. The Supreme Court had a tradition of upholding U.S. laws when they conflict with international law.  If Trump acts with the approval of Congress there is no problem under U.S. law, he said. There would be little recourse to challenge such a decision under international law - the Paris Agreement has no sanctions for non-compliance. Many delegates reckon Trump is likely to have other priorities, from the economy to immigration.  Trump may find it easier simply to oppose President Barack Obamas domestic plans to reduce U.S. emissions by between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. The idea of the Paris Agreements four-year wait is that it sets a legal trap, said Tosi Mpanu Mpanu, head of the 48-nation group of least developed nations. By the time Trump gets round to thinking about it we could have another president. ",politicsNews,"November 10, 2016 ",1

"Tough reality check for Trump's pledge of better heartland jobs, wages","CHARLOTTE, North Carolina - Donald Trumps promise to revive small town America faces a tough challenge in an economy that for decades has been wired to direct income and opportunities toward urban hubs and the better educated. Little in the president-elects so far sketchy economic plans indicates the trend can be reversed any time soon, according to interviews with experts on income inequality and  recent occupational trends. The manufacturing jobs Trump pledges to bring back have disappeared as much because of automation as the trade deals he has promised to rewrite, and that process will only continue. A promised infrastructure revamp would boost middle wage jobs but for only as long as the programs last, economists point out. During President Barack Obamas eight years in office incomes for the best off continued to diverge, despite nearly 10 million new jobs and recent strength in those paying middle-tier wages. On a pre-tax basis, the share of income to the top fifth of households increased from 50.4 percent to 51.4 percent between 2008 and 2015 at the expense of all the others, according to census estimates. (Graphic:tmsnrt.rs/2elimH2) Without the sort of tax and redistribution policies Republicans have traditionally opposed, Trump may struggle to make good on his promise to help those left behind in the global economy, economists who study inequality trends say.  We have 30 to 40 years to catch up on...Lots of money has gone to the top and to change that is going to be a long and slow process, said David Madland, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a think tank with close ties to Democratic nominee Hillary Clintons campaign.  Trump campaigned promising to shake up a Washington establishment he argued was responsible for destroying middle class jobs with bad trade deals. The message hit home across rural America and mid-sized cities, where voters felt they missed out on the fruits of the seven-year economic recovery that big cities may have enjoyed. Charlotte has been growing fast as a financial hub that attracts college educated talent from around the country, and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton did better there than Obama did in 2012, handily beating Trump by 137,000 votes. But in the states textile and furniture belt just northwest from here, Trumps promise of economic renewal and anxieties of a shrinking white majority more than offset Clintons urban victory, giving him 76 out of 100 North Carolinas counties. The Catawaba County region, one of the nations hardest-hit by cheap imports from China, now has a more diverse economy and even the furniture industry has begun adding jobs. But many still live in poverty and rely on disability and social services for support. The trade argument was as prominent as any. That is certainly the bet that the Trump campaign has made, said      John Dinan, a political scientist at Wake Forest University. Trump has not highlighted income inequality the way Clinton did, but to help low-wage industries such as textiles or offer a new deal for blacks, he would need to tackle the income gap. Recent data show how hard it may be if Trump relies on economic growth alone: Despite a record jump in household income and a continued surge in middle wage jobs nationally, the effect on income inequality was statistically insignificant according to census estimates. Under Obama, after tax income for the bottom fifth of households did increase by about 18 percent, or $2,200, according to a recent Council of Economic Advisers study. But that was made possible by higher taxes on the wealthy, more benefits for the poor and, in large part, by an estimated $1,900 gain from health coverage extended under the Affordable Care Act. Trump has vowed to roll Obamacare back. Instead, Trump has proposed to strike better trade deals and offered a familiar Republican recipe - tax cuts for businesses meant to spur investment and jobs. He has been ambiguous about a possible increase in the federal minimum wage typically opposed by Republicans, but advocated by many economists as a way to help the disenfranchised workers Trump focused on in his campaign. Economists say that even if economic growth accelerates under Trump, it may not do much to counter the downward pressures on wages and middle income jobs from automation, technology and other longstanding trends. Brookings Institution senior fellow Isabel V. Sawhill said researchers on inequality agree on one point: it is hard to move the needle. Even when you distribute all of the dividends from growth in a progressive fashion you dont change things very much, Sawhill said. You shift things at the margin.

House Republicans test Trump on his U.S.-Mexico wall,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the House of Representatives hope to offer President-elect Donald Trump an alternate plan to his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall, a first test by lawmakers from his own party of one of his key campaign promises. Just a day after Trumps stunning election victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton, congressional aides told Reuters the lawmakers wanted to meet with Trumps advisers to discuss a less costly option to his big, beautiful, powerful wall. The plan would involve more border fencing and additional border staffing with federal agents, many of whom belong to labor unions that supported Trumps candidacy, the aides said. Double layers of fencing would be extended along parts of the roughly 2,000-mile (3,200-km) border, rather than constructing a brick-and-mortar wall, according to the proposal. A House Republican aide and a Department of Homeland Security official said a wall was not realistic because it would block visibility for border agents and cut through rugged terrain, as well as bodies of water and private land. The House aide said House Republicans working on the alternative plan were waiting for Trumps transition team to be put in place before setting a date for the meeting. A spokesman for Trump did not respond to a request for comment on the lawmakers proposal or their desired meeting.  Mexico said on Wednesday that it would not pay for a border wall, as Trump has pledged. Immigration was a central feature of the Trump campaign, focusing on concerns among some voters about illegal immigrants and perceptions they take jobs and pose security risks.  Before the Republican convention in July, party platform committee members successfully petitioned delegates to add language about the proposed wall to the platform statement.  But U.S. Republican Representative Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, has called a wall along the entire border a knee-jerk reaction and has not mentioned the idea in legislation on Capitol Hill.  If Congress stands up to Trump, his wall may end up being a fence extension, said Steve Legomsky, professor emeritus and immigration law expert at Washington University School of Law. Congress wont fund the kind of wall Trump promised, and Mexico wont pay for it. But to save face, President Trump and congressional leaders will likely agree to a modest extension of the existing border fence, Legomsky predicted. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Wednesday that border security was an important agenda item that he wanted to achieve in whatever way is the most effective. The National Border Patrol Council, a union representing border agents, said the agency had already had a difficult time meeting hiring goals mandated by Congress.

Vexation gives way to pragmatism as Wall Street girds for Trump,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street power brokers may have rolled their eyes in private when ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker Steven Mnuchin agreed to be Donald Trumps national finance chairman, but now they are lining up to meet him. Financial lobbyists and their bosses are hoping that Mnuchin and others Trump has enlisted as advisers will help convey their views and act as interpreters of the president-elects so far at times confusing messages. This is different from a lot of elections in the past where you could say, If so-and-so wins, this will be good for that industry and bad for that one, said Scott Bok, chief executive of investment bank Greenhill & Co Inc. Its not like Trump laid out a clear set of policies where you can say, This is good for these types of companies and bad for those. Bankers and their lobbyists are hoping their path to influence will become clearer in the coming weeks with Trumps cabinet appointments. It is a matter now of getting to the people who are coming in and convincing them of the benefits of some moderate deregulation to foster economic growth, said one industry executive, who declined to speak publicly about Trump. During the presidential campaign, many people on Wall Street had supported his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton viewing her as a pragmatist and a stabilizing force.    Despite castigating hedge fund managers for getting away with murder on their taxes and making a vague pledge to strip big banks of their profitable trading arms, Trump has surrounded himself with financiers including Mnuchin and hedge fund firm bosses John Paulson and Anthony Scaramucci. At the time some of their peers thought they were taking an opportunistic punt as they viewed Trump as unpredictable and populist and were vexed by his snipes at the industry. Six months later, government-relations executives for big banks are scrambling to secure meetings with them as well as key staffers on Capitol Hills important financial committees, in hopes they can provide a sympathetic ear for the industry. That work begins immediately, said one industry lobbyist who was not authorized to speak publicly. Trumps lack of political experience and his scattershot pronouncements have made him a wild card for big business, making private contacts with his inner circle especially critical.     On bank regulation, Trump has promised to repeal the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and implement a new, possibly tougher one, but offered few details on what it would look like. Although Trumps outsider status helped him win, he has turned to some well-known Washington insiders when looking to fill vacancies at U.S. financial regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Former Republican SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, who founded and heads the regulatory consulting firm Patomak Global Partners LLC, is leading the transition team for financial regulation, according to a person familiar with the matter. Come January, Trump is expected to designate SEC Republican Commissioner Michael Piwowar as acting chair. It is unclear if Trump will make the role permanent or later tap someone new. SEC Chair Mary Jo White, an independent appointed by President Barack Obama in 2013, is expected to leave the agency when Obamas term is over. Mnuchin is seen as the likely pick for Treasury Secretary. He did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. KBW policy analyst Brian Gardner predicts Vice President-elect Mike Pence will have a major influence on who gets appointed to key roles, and will choose orthodox Republicans who are equally familiar as some others in Trumps circle. In an emailed statement, Scaramucci said Trumps reputation for unpredictability was undeserved. While spending time with President-elect Trump during the campaign I got to know a very analytical and compassionate person, Scaramucci, founder and a co-managing partner of investment firm SkyBridge Capital, said.  Several policy experts predicted Trump and the new Congress will water down some financial reform rules, such as the Durbin amendment that limits bank fees or the Volcker rule against proprietary trading. They uniformly expect diminished power, if not a gutting of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But the Trump administration may also propose regulations that are more problematic, such as extremely high capital requirements or a revival of the Depression-era Glass Steagall law that broke up big banks. Mnuchin, however, was cited by many as a ray of hope. Although he has not publicly expressed opinions on financial regulation or fiscal policy, bankers and lobbyists said they felt reassured by his experience on Wall Street. I cant imagine that his goal would be to destroy Goldman Sachs, said the industry executive, which is better than some. ",politicsNews,"November 10, 2016 ",1
Trump likely to reward loyalty with top appointments,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trumps early list of potential appointments to top positions appears to reward people who were loyal to him after a campaign in which many Republican Party leaders kept their distance. Jeff Sessions, an Alabama senator who was one of Trumps most fervent supporters in the U.S. Congress, is said to be under consideration for a prominent role, perhaps defense secretary, sources familiar with transition planning said on Wednesday.     Retired General Michael Flynn emerged as a possible pick for Trumps national security adviser, the sources said. Flynn, a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, played a prominent role during the campaign, often serving as an introductory speaker at campaign rallies and has provided private counsel on foreign affairs. He has a calming influence on Trump, said a source familiar with transition planning.     In addition, former House of Representatives Newt Gingrich and U.S. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee were also considered potential selections for secretary of state, the sources said. Corker chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Both Corker and Gingrich had been under discussion as potential vice presidential picks for Trump, a position that eventually went to Indiana Governor Mike Pence. These same sources said Republican National Committee Reince Priebus, who has emerged as a trusted adviser to the New York businessman, was being talked about as a potential White House chief of staff. A Priebus deputy, RNC senior strategist Sean Spicer, was a possibility for White House press secretary. Trumps campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, who helped bring about a more disciplined approach to the candidate, was seen as potential White House senior adviser. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who endorsed Trump after dropping out of the 2016 Republican presidential nomination fight, was a possible education secretary. Richard Grenell, a former spokesman for the United States at the United Nations, was a potential U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, as was New York Republican Representative Peter King. Mike Rogers, a former chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, was in the mix for CIA director, the sources said. Trump's transition team set up a website (www.greatagain.gov/) and Twitter account (@transition2017), promising to keep the country posted on plans, Politico reported. Trump was a prolific user of Twitter during the campaign, sometimes using it to deliver pithy put-downs of his critics and rivals. ",politicsNews,"November 10, 2016 ",1
"Clinton, Obama pledge unity behind Trump presidency","(Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump put aside the celebrations and focused on Wednesday on his 73-day transition to the White House as rival Hillary Clinton promised to bury the bitterness of their long presidential race and work to unify a divided country. After Trumps stunning upset of the heavily favored Clinton, Democratic President Barack Obama and leading figures in the Republican Party who had struggled to make peace with Trump all vowed to move past the campaign ugliness. Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead, Clinton, the Democratic nominee, said in a concession speech in New York, joined by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and daughter Chelsea. While her loss was painful and it will be for a long time, she had offered to work with Trump as he prepares to begin his four-year term on Jan. 20, Clinton told supporters. A wealthy New York real estate developer and former reality TV host, Trump rode a wave of anger toward Washington insiders to win Tuesdays election against Clinton. A former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state, Clinton also ran for president in 2008. Obama, who campaigned hard against Trump, invited him to the White House for a meeting on Thursday after a brutal night for the Democratic Party, which also fell short of recapturing majorities in both chambers of Congress. We are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country, Obama said at the White House, adding he and his staff would work with Trump to ensure a successful transition. We are not Democrats first, we are not Republicans first, we are Americans first. But reflecting the bitterness of a long election campaign that often focused more on character than on policy, scattered anti-Trump protests broke out across the country, including in New York and Chicago, with demonstrators denouncing Trumps campaign rhetoric about immigrants, Muslims and other groups. Thousands of protesters thronged Midtown Manhattan and marched toward Trump Tower on Wednesday evening, while at a park farther downtown, hundreds of people shouted: Not my president. In Chicago, thousands gathered outside the Trump International Hotel and Tower downtown while chanting phrases like No Trump! No KKK! No racist USA. Trump and his senior aides met at Trump Tower in New York  to begin the transition. They are hunkered down in meetings, plotting the next steps, the transition, the first 100 days, key staff positions, said a source close to Trumps campaign. Potential choices for his administration included Republican figures who eagerly supported Trump even when he faced opprobrium from other senior Republicans. Possible names included Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus as White House chief of staff, RNC spokesman Sean Spicer as White House spokesman, U.S. Senators Jeff Sessions and Bob Corker in possible roles as secretary of state or defense secretary, and former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich as secretary of state, a source close to the campaign said. Trump will enjoy Republican majorities in both chambers of the U.S. Congress that could help him implement his legislative agenda and appoint a Supreme Court justice to fill the vacancy created by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. In the Senate, Democrats secured a second gain on Wednesday, when Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte conceded defeat in New Hampshire to challenger Maggie Hassan, the states Democratic governor. But the Republicans retained their majority. Now, Donald Trump will lead a unified Republican government and we will work hand-in-hand on a positive agenda to tackle this countrys big challenges, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who had a strained relationship with Trump, told reporters, saying Trump had earned a mandate in the election. In an Oct. 25 Reuters interview, Trump said his top priorities when he took office would be building stronger borders, repealing Obamas national healthcare plan, aiding military veterans and working to create more jobs. In his victory speech early on Wednesday, he also promised to embark on a project to rebuild American infrastructure and to double U.S. economic growth. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday that repealing the healthcare plan known as Obamacare would be a pretty high item on the agenda. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement that she spoke to Trump about passing a robust jobs bill. Worried that a Trump victory could cause economic and global uncertainty, investors initially fled stocks worldwide, but Wall Street made a dramatic turnaround and the U.S. dollar hit its highest level against the Japanese yen in nearly four months.  The Mexican peso recouped some losses after falling to a record low. The currency has been vulnerable to Trumps threats to rip up a free trade agreement with Mexico and to tax money sent home by migrants to pay to build a border wall. Speaking to cheering supporters after his victory, Trump said it was time to heal divisions. It is time for us to come together as one united people, Trump said. I will be president for all Americans, he said, praising Clinton for her service. His comments departed sharply from his campaign rhetoric in which he repeatedly branded Clinton as Crooked Hillary amid supporters chants of lock her up. Trumps campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, did not rule out on Wednesday the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate Clintons past conduct, a threat Trump made in an election debate last month. Obama spokesman Josh Earnest said the White House hoped the tradition of not using the criminal justice system to exact revenge on political opponents would continue under Trump. Senior House Republican Jason Chaffetz plans to continue investigating Clintons use of a private rather than government email server while she was secretary of state, a Chaffetz aide said. FBI Director James Comey has said a year-long probe by the agency into the setup revealed nothing to merit criminal charges.     Despite losing the state-by-state electoral battle that determines the U.S. presidency, Clinton narrowly led Trump in the nationwide popular vote, according to U.S. media tallies. Fueling his upset win was Trumps avid support among white non-college educated workers. He ran up big leads in rural areas, beating Clinton by 27 percentage points among voters outside of urban areas, a Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll found. While Clinton, 69, won Hispanics and black and young voters, she did not win those groups by greater margins than Obama did in 2012. Younger blacks did not support Clinton like they did Obama. She won eight of 10 black voters between the ages of 35 and 54. Obama won almost 100 percent of those voters in 2012. At 70, Trump will be the oldest first-term U.S. president. The presidency will be Trumps first elected office, and it remains to be seen how he will work with Congress. During the campaign, Trump was the target of sharp disapproval, not just from Democrats but from many in his own party. Foreign leaders pledged to work with Trump, but some officials expressed alarm the vote could mark the end of an era in which Washington promoted democratic values and was seen by its allies as a guarantor of peace. During the campaign, Trump expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, questioned central tenets of the NATO military alliance and suggested that Japan and South Korea should develop nuclear weapons to shoulder their own defense burden. Russia and Putin appeared to be winners from Trumps victory. Defying years of U.S. foreign policy orthodoxy, the Republican had promised much warmer relations with Moscow, despite Russias intervention in the Syrian civil war and its seizure of Ukraines Crimea region.  Russias parliament erupted in applause after a lawmaker announced that Trump had been elected, and Putin told foreign ambassadors he was ready to fully restore ties with Washington. Russia is hoping that improved relations could yield an elusive prize: the lifting or easing of sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union to punish Moscow for its 2014 annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who sparred with Obama, spoke by phone to Trump, who proposed they meet at the first opportunity, Netanyahus office said. Chinese President Xi Jinping said Beijing and Washington shared responsibility for promoting global development and prosperity. Iran urged Trump to stay committed to the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers, which Trump has sharply criticized. Several authoritarian and right-wing leaders hailed Trumps victory. Other officials abroad, some with senior roles in government, took the unusual step of denouncing the outcome, calling it a worrying signal for liberal democracy and tolerance in the world. Trump is the pioneer of a new authoritarian and chauvinist international movement. He is also a warning for us, German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said in an interview with the Funke newspaper group. U.S. neighbor Mexico was pitched into deep uncertainty by the victory for Trump, who has often accused it of stealing U.S. jobs and sending criminals across the U.S. border. Trump campaigned on a pledge to take the country on a more isolationist, protectionist America First path.  He wants to rewrite international trade deals to reduce trade deficits and has taken positions that raise the possibility of damaging relations with Americas most trusted allies in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

"U.S. voters say yes to big bond issues, mixed message on taxes","(Reuters) - U.S. voters on Tuesday favored a surge in borrowing for public projects, approving some of the biggest bond measures on ballots, while support for new taxes was mixed, according to election results on Wednesday. Final voting tallies were not immediately available for all of the 682 state, school and local government bond measures, according to data company Ipreo.  At $70.3 billion, the amount of bond issuance requested to fund the building and repairing schools, mass transit, roads, and other projects was the largest in a decade. To view the historical amount of bond ballot measures, click on tmsnrt.rs/2e9Z5bb. Some of the largest bond requests won approval, including the biggest bond proposal in Tuesdays election: $9 billion of California general obligation debt in the states so-called Proposition 51. This will finance new construction and modernization for K-12 and charter schools and community colleges, according to semi-official election results on the California Secretary of States website. Passage of Proposition 51 is credit positive for school districts with approved, but unfunded capital projects under the state School Facility Program, which is depleted, Lori Trevino, an analyst at Moodys Investors Service, wrote in a research note on Wednesday. With 195 bond measures totaling $41.7 billion, California issuers accounted for nearly 60 percent of the total par amount of debt on ballots nationwide. Californias voters rejected Proposition 53, a proposal to rein in debt by requiring statewide voter approval for revenue bonds exceeding $2 billion for projects financed, owned or managed by the state. The rejection removes a hurdle standing in the way of projects such as the $14.9 billion California Water Fix project for upgrading its water infrastructure. It assures that the states water policymakers will have the tools necessary to implement the California Water Fix, although they still face an uphill battle to secure the full approval and financial backing necessary to implement the plan, Shannon Groff, Fitch Ratings director of U.S. Public Finance, said in a statement. As for tax measures, California voters passed a 12-year extension of a temporary state personal income tax increase on earnings of $250,000 or more and a cigarette tax hike. Voters in 35 states weighed 154 state-wide measures, including bonds and taxes, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which posted results on its website. Montana voters said no to creating a biomedical research authority funded by $200 million of bonds over 10 years. In Colorado, voters turned down a proposed constitutional amendment calling for a public option universal healthcare payment system, funded by a new 10 percent state payroll tax. They also rejected a cigarette tax hike. Arkansas voters agreed to lift a cap on state bond issuance for economic development projects. Illinois will have to earmark money generated from transportation-related fees and taxes exclusively for transportation uses, under a new constitutional amendment approved by voters. New Jersey voters approved the use of gasoline taxes solely to fund road, bridge and mass transit projects, and to allow $12 billion of transportation borrowing over eight years. Governor Chris Christie signed a 23-cent gas tax hike into law in October. In Missouri, voters amended the state constitution to prohibit any new tax on services or transactions. Oklahoma voters turned down a sales tax hike for public education. A corporate tax hike to fund education in Oregon also failed. Washington state voters rejected the nations first tax on carbon emissions.  At the local level, San Diego voters rejected a measure to raise hotel taxes and direct hundreds of millions of public dollars toward building a new National Football League stadium in downtown San Diego for the Chargers team.

U.S. spy agencies to begin top secret Trump briefings within days,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. intelligence agencies will soon begin giving President-elect Donald Trump the same top secret national security briefings they give President Barack Obama, current and former intelligence officials said Wednesday. The briefings by veteran career intelligence analysts, which will begin in the next few days, will include some of the governments most closely-guarded secrets, including details of undercover espionage operations and classified intelligence collection methods, including the National Security Agencys controversial eavesdropping operations, the officials said. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which will be in charge of Trumps briefings, had no immediate comment. Im certain the intelligence agencies will approach these briefings with absolute professionalism, said John McLaughlin, a former Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency who participated in presidential briefings. Once the American people have chosen a president he or she is entitled to complete support from intelligence, and intelligence agencies have to assume that a president-elect will be equally professional, McLaughlin said.  He added: I have seen the transformation that occurs when candidates become presidents and realize the awesome responsibility that rests on them. We can only hope it happens again. The president-elect has received the final anointing by the American people, and is the person the intelligence community knows it will be serving over the next four years, said Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA analyst. There is every reason to be as thorough and forthcoming briefing the president-elect as in briefing the incumbent president. Not long after Trump was confirmed as the Republican presidential nominee, intelligence officials gave him and a small team of advisors two general briefings on threats and foreign policy issues facing the United States. Those pre-election briefings contained some classified information, but not anything about covert operations or intelligence-collection methods. ",politicsNews,"November 10, 2016 ",1
McConnell dashes hopes for Pacific trade deal vote before Trump takes office,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday dashed any remaining hopes that President Barack Obamas signature Pacific-Rim trade deal would come up for a vote before President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. Its certainly not going to be brought up this year, McConnell said of the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) at a news briefing in Washington. McConnell said any decisions on TPP or other future trade agreements would be up to Trump, who would still have the authority for four more years to negotiate better deals with expedited approval procedures in Congress. Trump excoriated TPP on the campaign trail as a disaster and a rape of our country, tapping into populist anger at globalization, trade and manufacturing job losses that helped propel his candidacy. In an opinion piece published on Monday, Trump advisers Peter Navarro and Alexander Gray reiterated his opposition to major trade deals.   Trump will never again sacrifice the U.S. economy on the altar of foreign policy by entering into bad trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement, allowing China into the World Trade Organization, and passing the proposed TPP, Navarro and Gray wrote in Foreign Policy magazine. These deals only weaken our manufacturing base and ability to defend ourselves and our allies.  The Obama administration has been promoting TPP among lawmakers and industry groups in anticipation of a long-shot, post-election vote despite opposition to the deal by Trump and his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. While there are many Republican supporters of free trade and TPP in Congress, McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday they were now focused on laying the groundwork with Trump to pass Republican-focused healthcare and tax reform legislation next year. A spokeswoman for Ryan said he had not had a change of heart since he said on a radio talk show in October that the House would not bring TPP up for a vote because of problems with several provisions and insufficient support in the House. McConnell said his priorities for the post-election lame-duck session were passing a government funding extension and medical innovation legislation. White House spokesman Josh Earnest was still trying to sell the TPP agreement in a news briefing on Wednesday. President Obama does continue to believe that this is the best opportunity that the Congress has to take advantage of the benefits of a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that cuts taxes, 18,000 taxes, that other countries impose on American products, Earnest told reporters. Weve got a strong case to make. But the strong vote for Trump in industrial states made it unlikely Republicans would be willing to go against him on trade policy, analysts said. Its fair to say that TPP is now in the dustbin of history, said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a pro-trade think tank in Washington. I dont see a path forward for the United States to join. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1

Fractured Republicans come together in face of Trump triumph,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - One immediate consequence of Donald Trumps stunning victory in the U.S. presidential race is that the identity crisis that convulsed the Republican Party during his tumultuous candidacy has been resolved. Its Trumps party now, for better or worse. Although having never before held public office, the businessman and former reality TV star vanquished 16 other Republican candidates to win the nomination and go on to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton, but established Republicans challenged his commitment to party tenets and organized against him. Trumps political ascent encountered fierce opposition from some in the partys establishment wing that includes former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Ohio Governor John Kasich and from others in its social-conservative faction, such as U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. All of them criticized Trump at times for straying from orthodox Republican positions on such issues as trade, his temperament or his lack of governing experience. But on Wednesday, all of that seemed forgotten and forgiven, at least for the moment, as Trump, the surprise winner in a 17-month-long election campaign, prepared to take power with the backing of Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress and the promise of an aggressive conservative agenda.  The American people have spoken and its time to come together, Kasich tweeted on Wednesday after he scrapped plans for a speech in Washington later this week that was intended to pave a new direction for the party after an expected Trump loss.  Bush said he would pray for Trump. Cruz termed Trumps win an amazing victory for the American worker. Paul Ryan, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives who had drawn the ire of Trump supporters by refusing to campaign for him, praised Trump on Wednesday and said that voters had delivered Trump a mandate to pursue his agenda, having won the electoral vote that counts while Clinton likely won the popular vote.  Had Trump lost, both Ryan and Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, were expected to face challenges to their jobs. Now, having protected his House majority, Ryan will be Trumps top legislative ally.  If, as many expect, Priebus is tapped by Trump to join his administration, Trump will be able to replace him with a hand-picked successor, thus cementing his grip on the partys apparatus.  Republican donors who did not support Trump, too, were coming around.  Nothing unifies like these decisive wins, and nothing unifies like the power of having the House, the Senate and the White House, said an adviser to a leading donor. Representative Chris Collins, who was an early Trump supporter, said without the opposition of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, many divisions within the Republican Party would dissipate.  The big difference is we now have complete Republican control, Collins told Reuters. Were all on the same page give or take 10 percent, which is nuances more than anything. Trump adopted much of the Better Way domestic policy agenda Ryan has painstakingly put together in over the last few years, notably revising his tax plan to bring it roughly in line with House Republicans proposal after initially floating much more drastic reform. Trump this year proposed cutting the top individual income tax rate to 33 percent from its current 39.6 percent. He had initially said he would drop that rate down to 25 percent but revised his proposal after tax experts said it would balloon government deficits. While Trump has offered a bare-bones outline of his replacement plan for Obamas signature national healthcare law known as Obamacare, advisers told Reuters he would draw heavily on the House version. At a news conference on Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that Congress under Trump would move quickly to repeal Obamacare. It remains to be seen whether House Republicans view Trumps mandate as extending to other, prominent campaign promises. Trump staked much of his candidacy on opposing major trade deals, while Republicans have generally favored free trade. Trump promised repeatedly not to touch Medicare and Social Security federal retirement benefits, asserting that Clinton would slash those programs even though she had not proposed to do so. Most mainstream Republicans believe revamping Medicare and Social Security is critical to curbing federal spending. Trump vowed to repeal the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. During the campaign he met with House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling but never endorsed Hensarlings proposed bank regulation legislation and instead called for a return to the 1930s Glass-Steagall law separating commercial and investment banking.  Representative Warren Davidson, a member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus in the House, said he thought Congress could get some early wins on areas of agreement with Trump that included replacing Obamacare and finding a way to repatriate corporate profits held overseas and using the money to pay for infrastructure repairs.  Richard Hunt, head of the Consumer Bankers Association, which lobbies for some of the biggest U.S. banks, said Republicans must act swiftly to show that as change agents they can actually govern. They have to show the American people that Republicans are able and capable of governing. Obviously there was a clear mandate last night that says Washington is not working and people want Washington to work, he said. Part of me says you need to have a clean slate, okay, that was the campaign, now this is governing. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
Mexico's Pena Nieto says agreed Trump meeting during transition period,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said on Wednesday that he spoke to U.S. President-Elect Trump to congratulate him on his election win and the two agreed to meet before he takes office.  Pena Nieto also said he had discussed a new work agenda with Trump that would include security issues, and that he would seek to protect the rights of Mexicans throughout the world.    Pena Nieto was lambasted in the local press for hosting a pre-election meeting with Trump, who has made disparaging remarks about Mexicans.  ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
"Factbox: Top goals for President Trump, hurdles in front of him","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to shake up Washington and as president the brash real estate mogul will be in a position to dramatically change how the United States handles immigration, trade and a range of other policies. Yet many of his more ambitious proposals will require cooperation from Congress. While he will likely enjoy a post-election honeymoon with congressional Republicans, a long-lasting romance is far from guaranteed, given his uneasy relationship with congressional leaders and some basic ideological differences he has with Republican orthodoxy. Following is an overview of Trumps top domestic policy plans, based on the sometimes vague details of his agenda, and their likelihood of success: In his campaign, Trump argued that international trade agreements had hurt U.S. workers and the countrys competitiveness. He has promised to get tough on China, withdraw from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, which is still not finalized, and renegotiate or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement, the 1994 free-trade deal with Mexico and Canada.  As president, Trump does have some power to raise tariffs on countries such as China. He could delay the TPP, as well, even if Congress approves it. Economists have warned that such moves would damage the economy by forcing consumers to pay dramatically higher prices on everything from refrigerators to T-shirts. U.S. exports, such as airplanes and soybeans, would likely suffer as well.      On the campaign trail, Trump has promised to build a wall along the Mexican border, deport millions of undocumented immigrants and ban immigration from countries that have been compromised by terrorism.  Those policies would not come cheap. Trump has estimated the wall would cost $8 billion to $12 billion. Other estimates have run much higher. Politico estimated it would cost at least $166 billion to deport all of those in the country illegally and complete a border wall. While many congressional Republicans support those policies, they might blanch at the cost. Trump has said he would force Mexico to pay for the wall, but he has no power to force another country to spend money on something it does not want.  More broadly, Trump could shift the broader debate over immigration, empowering skeptics like Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who want to reduce overall immigration levels and reduce the number of skilled guest workers. That would be a blow to business groups and Hispanic advocates who have sought to relax immigration laws. Trump has promised to repeal President Barack Obamas signature Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, and replace it with a plan that would give states more control over the Medicaid health plan for the poor and allow insurers to sell plans nationally. He would need Congress to act, and Republicans could have difficulty getting the 60 votes needed to advance a repeal effort through the 100-seat Senate. Republicans could face a public backlash if they repeal a law that has provided healthcare to millions of Americans. A Trump administration would have plenty of other opportunities to undermine Obamacare, however, by appointing officials who are not committed to its success. Trump has vowed to make deep tax cuts, while also promising to protect popular health and retirement programs that account for more than a third of U.S. government spending. That combination of policies would massively increase the national debt, according to the nonpartisan Center for a Responsible Budget. He has also proposed increasing spending on the military and infrastructure, but has said he would reduce spending on categories other than health and retirement by 1 percent each year. On taxes, he would get plenty of help from Republicans in Congress, who have been laying the groundwork for a tax-code overhaul that would lower rates and close loopholes. But they will encounter fierce resistance from homeowners, businesses and other interest groups that benefit from current tax breaks. Trumps promise to protect entitlement programs will rile fiscal conservatives, who worry they will swamp the federal budget in the decades to come. But those programs are popular with the American public. Trump has promised a dismantling of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted following the financial crisis, but has given few details. The Republican Partys platform calls for reinstating Glass-Steagall, the 1930s-era law that forced the separation of investment banks from deposit-taking institutions. Trumps former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, said in July that his campaign backed that change. Republican lawmakers have so far been unable to undo many of their most-despised pieces of the Dodd-Frank law, and many in their ranks oppose a return to Glass-Steagall. Trump has offered few details about his plans to fight Islamic State but has said he would knock the hell out of the militant group. He says he is keeping the details of his strategy a secret so as not to disclose them to the enemy. Trump has said if he wins, he would give U.S. generals 30 days after he takes office on Jan. 20 to propose their own plans. Trump has said he opposes accepting refugees fleeing violence in Syria, and instead has said he would create safe zones there, which he says would be funded by Gulf states. Obama has said a safe zone in Syria would require a large U.S. military commitment, something that could prove to be unpopular with Americans weary of lengthy wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Trump has said he would have a very, very good relationship with Russia.  Trump has said could work with Russia to combat Islamic State. He also said he would look into recognizing Crimea, seized from Ukraine in 2014, as Russian territory and lifting sanctions on Russia imposed by Western nations for what they called an illegal land grab. Trump has criticized the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, saying some U.S. allies have not met their defense commitments. In July, he said if Russia attacked a NATO member, he would consider whether the country has paid up before providing defense. NATO leaders say the sanctions against Russia are key to persuading it to change that countrys behavior in Ukraine, where it has backed ethnic Russian separatists, and that the alliance has long been focused on fighting international terrorism. With one vacancy on the Supreme Court and several more likely in the coming four years, Trump will have a chance to put a conservative stamp on the nations courts for decades to come. His list of potential nominees has won praise from conservative activists and Republicans in the Senate, who will be eager to help him in that area. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
Factbox: Where Trump found his edge over Clinton,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump fared better with parts of U.S. society than expected, and Democrat Hillary Clinton did worse, to produce a U.S. presidential election outcome that defied opinion polls forecasting a Clinton victory. Early readings from a Reuters/Ipsos national Election Day opinion poll help explain how the New York real estate magnate eked out his advantage in Tuesdays vote. The Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It included more than 45,000 people who voted in the presidential election. The poll reading was taken after most  but not all  voters were counted in the presidential election. It will be updated as more poll responses are tallied and more votes are counted across the country. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
Timeline: Pivotal moments in Trump's presidential campaign,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps successful campaign for the presidency may have rewritten the political playbook. Here are key moments from his ascent. * June 16 - Trump descends an escalator in the marble-lined atrium of Trump Tower in Manhattan to announce his campaign and perhaps his best-known campaign pledge: to build a great, great wall on the southern border with Mexico. * July - Although his bid is initially dismissed as a sideshow by many commentators and journalists, opinion polls start showing Trump taking a lead in a crowded field of 17 Republican contenders. * Dec. 7 - Trump calls for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our countrys representative can figure out what is going on. The call followed deadly attacks in Paris, for which Islamic State claimed responsibility. * Feb. 1 - Despite being ahead in the polls, Trump comes in second in the Iowa caucuses, the first state nominating contest, losing to Ted Cruz, a senator from Texas popular among evangelical Christians. * March 1 - Trump wins seven of the 11 states that vote on so-called Super Tuesday. * March 3 - Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate in 2012, delivers a scathing speech calling Trump a con man, becoming an early mover in a wave of party leaders, including its living former presidents, who publicly reject Trump. * March 11 - Trump continues to draw huge crowds to sometimes volatile rallies, where protesters and Trump supporters would sometimes come to blows, but a rally in Chicago had to be canceled at the last minute amid sometimes violent protests outside the venue.  * May 3 - Trump wins Indiana, becoming the partys presumptive nominee after Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich withdraw from the race. * May 26 - Trump wins a majority of delegates, securing his nomination and foreclosing the possibility of a contested convention. * June 20 - Trump fires his original campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Veteran Republican strategist Paul Manafort takes over the running of the campaign. * July 15 - Trump announces Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate. A far more traditional Republican figure, Pence often describes himself as a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.  * July 21 - Trump accepts the Republican Partys nomination on the final day of the partys convention in Cleveland. * Aug. 17 - Trump taps Stephen Bannon, the chairman of the right-wing news website Breitbart News, as his campaigns chief executive and promotes senior adviser Kellyanne Conway to the post of campaign manager. Days later, Manafort, who was facing controversy over his previous consulting work in Ukraine, quits the campaign. * Sept. 1 - Trump flies to Mexico to meet with the countrys president, Enrique Pea Nieto, culminating in a joint news conference. A brief diplomatic scuffle follows Trumps return, where he and the Mexican president dispute whether or not they discussed Trumps plan to have Mexico pay for the border wall. * September/October - Trump clashes with Clinton before an audience of tens of millions in three presidential debates that are marked by their unusually ugly tone - Trump at one point said Clinton should be in jail. Public polls show that most Americans thought Clinton prevailed in all three debates. * Oct. 7 - A recording surfaces of Trump boasting in 2005 of how his celebrity allows him to grope women and grab them by the pussy, prompting a dozen or so women to come forward to accuse Trump of making unwanted sexual advances. Trump dismisses the remarks as locker room talk and denies the accusations of unwanted advances.  * Nov. 8 - Trump wins the U.S. presidential election in one of the biggest upsets in decades.

U.S. defense secretary pledges orderly transition to Trump admin,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter pledged to oversee an orderly transition to a Trump administration on Wednesday and thanked Pentagon employees for staying out of the political fray during the 2016 presidential campaign.

Despair and introspection on U.S. coasts after Trump win,"BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Americans in liberal enclaves from New York to San Francisco reacted with shock and despair on Wednesday to Republican businessman Donald Trumps defeat of Democrat Hillary Clinton, with many struggling to explain the result to their children. Trump, who had never before run for public office, won on a broad wave of support both from the Republican U.S. heartland and by flipping previously Democratic states, including Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio, helping his party protect majorities in both chambers of Congress. The victory stunned residents of major cities up and down the East and West coasts, many of whom had trusted opinion polls that had long predicted a Clinton victory but were proven profoundly wrong by Tuesdays results. Im feeling physical pain. Im shocked. Im sad, said Sofia Huizar, 30, as she waited outside the Manhattan hotel where Clinton conceded her loss on Wednesday morning, some eight hours after Trump declared victory. Huizar, a U.S. citizen who was born in Mexico, said she spent much of Tuesday night commiserating with family across the border. Its a way to help process the fear, Huizar said. Trumps campaign promises have included building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to stop illegal crossings and to deport the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. Others, like Kim Priban, a 38-year-old nurse who lives in the Cleveland suburb of Boston Heights, Ohio, said they had a difficult time breaking the news to their children.  Priban said she had proudly taken her 5-year-old daughter along to vote for Clinton, who would have been the first woman U.S. president, and on Wednesday morning had to discuss the result with her. I still havent quite figured out what to tell my daughter. Ive been crying all day, Priban said. I feel like I have to go out and make my voice heard for women and children. Priban and Huizar are likely far from alone in the depth of their pain over Clintons loss, academic research suggests. A 2015 paper by researchers at Harvard University found that voters who supported Republican Mitt Romneys unsuccessful White House bid reported sharper spikes in their unhappiness than parents following the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre of Connecticut schoolchildren or Boston residents after the deadly 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. While many Democrats along the coasts mourned Clintons defeat, Trump supporters celebrated the outcome, saying they hoped he would shake up a dysfunctional political system. The overwhelming majority of Americans want change, and this is a direct result. ... Trump is the disrupter, for better or for worse, said Kelley Smith, 33, who lives in Chicago and works in software sales. Hes a little bombastic. I dont think hes polished. But I dont think hes going to purposefully take our country down. The divide between the coasts and the heartland, evident not only in the results but also in the social media battles ahead of the election, made the Trump victory more shocking for liberals. Deena Pioli, an attorney from San Francisco, said she had rarely run into people who were not supporting Clinton, and that she now regrets that. Those of us here in San Francisco and California should not be so safe in our bubble, she said.   Trump dropped his angry speaking style to take a conciliatory tone when he declared victory early Wednesday morning, saying, I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans. Clinton and Democratic President Barack Obama sounded similarly restrained. But the breadth of Trumps win left his opponents urging self-examination. Folks should have deep humility in this moment, said civil rights activist DeRay Mckesson on Twitter. We all have things to learn from how Trump happened. Karen Parnett, a 48-year-old mother of three in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said she had been heartbroken to tell her children about Trumps win, and said the result illustrated the growing anger of lower-income voters who believe their concerns are being ignored by Washington. I have too much at stake with three kids to just throw up my hands and weep and say that all is lost, Parnett said. There are new realities and we need as a country to reckon with what in the world we are going to do about the disenfranchisement of the white working poor.

Republican foreign policy veterans in quandary over Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some Republican foreign policy veterans who came out against Donald Trump during the presidential campaign said on Wednesday they were sticking to their guns following his election victory, but a few others signaled that objections to serving in his new administration were softening. Trumps stunning upset over Democrat Hillary Clinton has created a new dilemma for the Republican national security establishment, much of which had publicly distanced itself from their own partys candidate, declaring him unfit to lead. They must now decide whether to return to the fold. Some career diplomats, intelligence officials and military officers are also facing a choice of whether to quit their posts because of concern that a Trump presidency would violate their principles, or else stay and try to influence policy from the inside. However, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said, I wouldnt expect a mass exodus. About 150 of the Republican partys most prominent national security specialists signed open letters in March and August in outright opposition to Trumps candidacy. One said he was utterly unqualified for the White House. The other warned that he would be the most reckless president in American history. While neither letter said the former officials would never work for Trump, their scathing critique was clearly intended to discourage fellow Republicans from supporting him. Trump responded at the time by deriding them as members of the failed Washington elite who deserve the blame for making the world such a dangerous place. A number of the signatories contacted by Reuters on Wednesday made clear that they were unswayed from their negative view of Trump and would not work for him. However, they stopped short of urging others to also shun the next administration, which is widely seen as having limited foreign policy expertise at a time when the next president will face the challenges of Syrias civil war, the fight against Islamic State, a newly assertive Russia and the rise of China. I dont expect to be asked. I wouldnt serve. But there are others who will. It will be a matter of individual conscience, said Eliot Cohen, who served as counselor to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and helped spearhead the March letter, which was posted on a blog called War on the Rocks and created a stir among Republicans. Im concerned about his ignorance, the belligerence, the misunderstanding of how the world works, Cohen said of Trump, a wealthy real estate developer and former reality TV host who rode to victory on a wave of voter anger toward Washington insiders. Max Boot, a foreign policy adviser to Republican Mitt Romneys 2012 presidential campaign and a supporter of the U.S.-led Iraq invasion in 2003, said: I wont have anything to do with Trump, but I dont know about others. I hope good people go into the government. But others appeared to waver, with some saying decisions on whether to join the Trump administration could depend on how the president-elect behaves during the transition and who he appoints to senior posts. Among the Trump allies said to be in consideration are former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich and one-time United Nations ambassador John Bolton for secretary of state, and General Michael Flynn, a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, for national security adviser. Dov Zakheim, a former Pentagon undersecretary who signed one of the dissent letters, said Trump would have to reach out beyond his circle of supporters to find enough qualified people to fill many important jobs. He will want to show that he is not dividing the Republican party, so he will extend an olive branch to those in the party who opposed him, Zakheim said. Asked whether he expected to be offered a post, he said: I have no idea, as its not up to me. Bryan McGrath, a retired US Navy officer and co-organizer of the War on the Rocks letter, said he did not expect that those who signed it were signing away employment rights, that they werent going to work in a Trump administration. If the president asks for your service, he said, you have to take that request seriously. Patrick Cronin, an Asia expert and former third-ranking official at USAID under President George W. Bush, said that despite his earlier opposition to Trump, he eventually briefed his transition team and would continue to provide advice. But he said he was not interested in joining the administration. Michael McFaul, President Barack Obamas former ambassador to Moscow and a Clinton supporter in the election,  said the Republicans had a deep bench of experience for enlisting foreign policy experts. Even as Trump prepares to form his foreign policy team, some career diplomats, intelligence officials and military officers are facing a post-election quandary. Some said privately before Tuesdays vote they would consider retiring or quitting rather than working under Trump, who alarmed them during the campaign by questioning U.S.-led alliances, praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggesting that Japan and South Korea should be allowed to have nuclear weapons and threatening to order the resumption of interrogation methods condemned as torture. Other officials suggested they would wait to see how he acts once in office and who henames to senior posts, saying the responsibility for government service transcended any one president. If he keeps some of his campaign promises, about the use of torture, for example, many of us have discussed whether we are honor-bound to resign or to stay and try to have some influence from the inside. Its too early to say, one CIA officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
"U.S. election was fair, despite voting obstacles: OSCE rights group","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said on Wednesday that human rights were respected during Tuesdays U.S. presidential election and there were few cases of intimidation, despite recent changes to election rules in several states that created unnecessary burdens for voters.  Some legal and administrative decisions appear to have had a partisan flavor, Ambassador Audrey Glover, head of the OSCE election observation mission to the United States, said at a news conference on Wednesday. These recent changes ... led to a lack of clarity regarding the rules. Tuesdays astonishing contest, in which Republican candidate Donald Trump beat his long-favored opponent, Hillary Clinton, to become the 45th president of the United States, was the first election to occur in the United States in more than 50 years without the full protections of the landmark Voting Rights Act. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2013 struck down a provision of the law that had allowed federal oversight of states with a history of racial discrimination, prompting the U.S. federal government to reduce its own election monitoring program.  The OSCE deployed nearly 300 observers to polling stations in 33 states, although they were not allowed to freely observe early voting and Election Day in 19 of those states, according to the international rights group. At almost half of the polling sites observed by the OSCE delegation, some citizens who wanted to vote were not found on the voter list, causing systemic concern regarding the effectiveness of voter registration methods, according to the group. Despite concerns that voters would be intimidated at the polls, the OSCE said, its observers did not see any serious incidents. However, U.S. civil rights groups logged unusual levels of voter intimidation complaints, receiving about 35,000 calls through a national voter complaint hotline as of Tuesday evening.    Revised voting laws and lengthy court battles in many states also left voters uncertain about when and where they could cast their ballot and whether they would need to present photo identification.

U.S. presidential election drives record ratings for cable news,"(Reuters) - The 2016 election cycle had been a ratings boon for U.S. cable news networks, and Tuesdays stunning U.S. presidential election victory by Republican Donald Trump was no different. Time Warner Incs CNN led all U.S. TV networks in primetime coverage with 13.3 million viewers, the most-watched Election Night coverage in U.S. cable news history, according to Nielsen data. 21st Century Foxs Fox News came in second with 12.1 million viewers, and Comcast Corps MSNBC was far behind with just under 6 million. Among adults aged 25 to 54, the demographic most important to advertisers who buy time on news programs, CNN was first as well with 6.7 million viewers. Fox News was second with 4.6 million and MSNBC drew 2.4 million in the demographic. All three posted gains from four years ago. With many states too close to call, the race was not called for Trump until around 3 a.m. (0800 GMT) on the East Coast. Fox News led cable news with 9.8 million viewers watching between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. (0700 and 0800 GMT), with CNN bringing in 6.5 million and 2.9 million watching on MSNBC.  Fox News also led all cable networks with their full coverage from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. (0000 to 0800), with 12.2 million, a network high for an election night. CNN pulled in 11.2 million for the whole night, but topped Fox News in the news demographic with 5.6 million to Fox News 4.8 million. MSNBC brought up the rear with 5.2 million and 2.1 million in the demographic. NBC led all the broadcast networks with 11.2 million viewers, with ABC finishing with 9.2 million and CBS pulling in 8.1 million. Fox averaged around 4 million for its two-hour coverage from 8-10 p.m.  Across 13 U.S. TV networks, election night coverage was watched by 71.42 million viewers, just behind the U.S. record of 71.47 million that watched in 2008.

Transgender advocates fear reversal of civil rights under Trump,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Transgender advocates vowed on Wednesday to resist any effort to reverse or slow down an expansion of transgender rights made under President Barack Obama, fearing a rollback of his directives once Donald Trump succeeds him in the White House. During his eight years in the Oval Office, Obama championed lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, and Democrat Hillary Clinton had promised to keep fighting for them if she was elected. Same-sex marriage became legal in 2015, shifting the LGBT discussion to the still-unfinished agenda of transgender rights. Obama has issued regulations prohibiting health insurers from denying coverage based on gender identity and directed public schools to allow transgender students to use the public bathrooms of their choice, among other measures. We expect that those will disappear, said Rachel B. Tiven, chief executive of Lambda Legal, a leading gay rights group. Lambda Legal will hold the line when our rights are under attack. We know how to fight the government in the courts. Trump sent mixed messages on transgender rights during the campaign. But he promised to nominate a conservative justice to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court and could name an attorney general who may enforce hard-line positions Trump outlined during the campaign. Were going to fight them on anything they try to undo, said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality. Im really worried today for trans Muslims and trans immigrants and trans people with disabilities who have been threatened and denigrated by Mr. Trump. Hopefully, that was all part of some sick performance. With the U.S. Supreme Court split between four liberals and four conservatives, Trump could appoint a conservative to tip the balance, possibly in time to decide a case involving a transgender boy who has sued to use the male restroom at his public school in Virginia. Shannon Minter, legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, called Trumps victory a huge wake-up call that placed an onus on transgender people to explain who we are to Trump voters who may be intolerant of or ignorant about transgender people. In a very real sense, our lives, our ability to work, to attend school, to obtain health care, are at the mercy of a new administration, Minter said. Trumps Justice Department and appointees to the federal bench could also have an impact on two provisions of federal law banning discrimination on the basis of sex - Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which covers employment, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. The Obama administration has taken a firm stance that the reference to sex protects transgender people. The courts have generally agreed, and Jill Gaulding, co-founder and legal director of Gender Justice, said that trend was likely to continue regardless of who is president. We can never take any rights for granted but I also think its important to remember how much progress we have made in recent years and decades, she said. Its not easy to repeal that kind of progress.

"Trump, U.S. Congress will agree on some issues, long-term questions loom","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump will have an early Capitol Hill honeymoon with Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress when he takes office in January, but a long-term romance may be more challenging. A president whose party controls both the Senate and House of Representatives can generally count on getting things done fairly quickly, and Trump likely will not be an exception, despite starting with unusual handicaps. Many Republicans in Congress only backed Trump after he became the candidate. Some never fell in line. He offended and attacked others while running as a Washington outsider, including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who did not campaign with him. On top of that, the New York real estate businessman and former reality television celebrity, who will head the worlds most powerful government and largest economy, has no governing experience. On Wednesday, party leaders were quick to back the victor,  and they are expected to find more common ground than differences once he takes office. Donald Trump will lead a unified Republican government, Ryan told a news conference in his home state, Wisconsin, promising to work hand in hand. Ryan said his relationship with Trump is fine, the transition is under way, and he has already spoken to the president-elect twice, and to his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a former House member. Most of the things hes likely to advocate, were going to be enthusiastically for, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told a news conference on Capitol Hill. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress agree on one major policy: They want to repeal Democratic President Barack Obamas landmark Obamacare healthcare law, enacted in 2010. Ryan and McConnell both pledged to deal quickly with the law. They will also move quickly to confirm a Trump nominee for the Supreme Court, after McConnell refused to consider any Obama nominee to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February, infuriating the White House and Senate Democrats. Other issues might be more contentious within the party. While campaigning, Trump spoke extensively about scrapping trade deals and building a wall along the U.S.- Mexico border, but some Republicans are skeptical about both those pledges. The party has long been in favor of free trade, and Trumps wall scheme would bear a $25 billion price tag and anger Mexico, an important ally and trading partner. McConnell said on Wednesday he wanted to achieve border security in whatever way was most effective. And he said the new president was free to negotiate trade pacts. Trump will also have to work with Democrats, who made narrow gains on Tuesday that reduced the size of the Republican majorities in the House and Senate. With some votes still being counted, they won a handful of new seats in the House. In the Senate, they seemed to secure at least 48 seats, up from 46, on Wednesday when the New Hampshire secretary of state called a close race for New Hampshire Governor Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, over incumbent Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte, although Ayotte had not conceded. Controlling only 52 seats, Republicans will need Democrats to reach the 60 votes needed to advance most legislation in the 100-member Senate. Trump will have to work with a fair number of Senate Democrats to get things done, said William Galston, an expert in governance studies at the Brookings Institution think tank. One of those things could be infrastructure spending, which Trump promised in his victory speech. Spending on infrastructure to fuel job growth is popular with lawmakers from both parties, possibly funded by ending a law that lets corporations hold profits offshore without paying U.S. taxes on them. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Trump Wednesday to say she wanted to work with him on a robust infrastructure jobs bill, and she told her fellow Democrats that this should be done very fast. Were not starting a campaign against the Republicans right now, Pelosi told Democratic lawmakers in a conference call, according to a Democratic aide. Trumps Republican critics in Congress said they hoped Trump would work toward party unity, but they would be watching him. Starting today, I will do everything in my power to hold the President to his promises, including fighting to enact term limits and repealing Obamacare, Senator Ben Sasse, who opposed Trump from the start, said in a statement. Repealing Obamacare would shake the U.S. healthcare and insurance industries, which have broadly called for measured reforms, although not for its full-scale elimination. Americas Health Insurance Plans, or AHIP, a trade association that represents insurers such as Anthem Inc and Cigna Corp in Washington, said late on Tuesday that it would work with any new administration on the issue. Trump has called Obamacare a disaster and vowed to repeal and replace it. House Republicans have already voted more than 50 times to repeal all or part of the law. Senate Democrats were certain to fight an Obamacare rollback, but could be outmaneuvered by Republicans at the procedural level with Trumps cooperation. It would be a tragedy, and I certainly wont in any way cooperate or work with an effort to take health insurance away, Senator Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, told CNN.  Trump and congressional Republicans will find common ground on taxes. Trump generally sees eye to eye with Republicans in Congress in calling for major tax cuts, including those for the wealthy, although details of their plans are not an exact match. Trump has called for cutting the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 15 percent from the current level of 35 percent; Ryans tax plan proposes going to 20 percent. Trump has also said he wants to do some things as president, such as ban Muslims from the country and allow torture in the fight against terrorism, that some legal experts say are legally questionable.

"How the polls, including ours, missed Trump's victory","NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Two days ago, pollsters and statisticians gave Hillary Clinton odds of between 75 and 99 percent of winning the U.S. presidential election. How did so many get it so wrong? In hindsight, the polling consensus went astray in two major ways. The media, including Reuters, pumped out two kinds of poll stories. Some were national surveys designed to estimate the entire countrys popular vote, but not the outcome in individual states, where the contest is actually decided. These polls actually got the big picture right: Clinton won more overall votes than President-elect Donald Trump - but not by as much as the polling averages predicted, and not where she needed to. News organizations also produced a blizzard of stories meant to calculate the probability of victory for the two candidates. These calculations were predicated on polls of individual states. In hindsight, though, the stories seem to have overstated Clintons chances for a win by failing to see that a shift in voting patterns in some states could show up in other, similar states.  In part, this is because polling analysts got the central metaphor wrong. U.S. presidents are chosen not by the national popular vote, but in the individual Electoral College contests in the 50 states and Washington D.C. In calculating probable outcomes, election predictors generally treated those 51 contests as completely separate events  as unrelated to one another as a series of 51 coin tosses.  But thats not how elections work in the United States. Voting trends that appear in one state - such as a larger-than-expected Republican shift among rural voters - tend to show up in other states with similar demographic make-ups.  And thats what happened Tuesday: The election models calculated the probabilities of a Clinton win that turned out to be high, because they viewed each state too much in isolation.  The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project projected Clinton to win the popular vote 45 percent to 42 percent, and gave her a 90 percent probability of winning the 270 electoral votes needed to secure the election. In the end, Clinton won the popular vote by 47.7 percent to 47.5 percent, by the latest count, and Trump could win the Electoral College by as many as 303 votes to Clintons 233 when the tally is final. The state races were not akin to a string of coin tosses but more like 51 rolls of a set of weighted dice. In many states, it turned out, the side of the dice representing white voters in suburban and rural counties carried a heavier weight, and the side representing urbanites a lighter one.  The problem, said Cliff Young, president of Ipsos Public Affairs US, the polling partner of Reuters, came down to the models the pollsters used to predict who would vote - the so-called likely voters. The models almost universally miscalculated how turnout was distributed among different demographic groups, Young said. And turnout was lower than expected, a result that generally favors Republican candidates.  In 2000, when Republican George W. Bush beat Democrat Al Gore, for example, the turnout was about 60 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Eight years later, turnout was 64 percent when Democratic nominee Barack Obama won his first presidential election against Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain. This year, whites with lower levels of education came out in greater relative numbers than younger, more-educated and minority voters, Young said. A point here or a point there can really change an election. Ultimately, missing that shift in the state polls tripped up the predictions. It also highlights how the otherwise empirical process of polling rests on a subjective foundation. Each pollster must make a decision about turnout. Their decisions are informed by historical voting patterns. But the actual turnout in each state is unknowable before election day. Among the questions pollsters grappled with this year: Will the electorate look like the won that gave Obama his 2008 victory - or George W. Bush in his 2000 victory? Would  black turnout fall after the historically high turnout enjoyed by Obama, the nations first black president, and by how much?  Key for me is turnout in explaining this years polling miss, Young said. The Reuters/Ipsos model anticipated turnout for white men, for example, at around 67 percent, which appears to have been too low, and for black women at 61 percent, which was probably too high. Demographic breakdowns arent available yet. Drew Linzer, a pollster and creator of the Daily Kos Elections forecasting model, which forecasts the Electoral College result by aggregating large numbers of state polls, said prediction models like his try to estimate the possibility of an unexpected turnout shift.  But ultimately, he said, the effectiveness of the models came down to the accuracy of the underlying state polls likely-voter models. Linzers model predicted a large win for Clinton in the Electoral College, 323 to 215. And because those polls missed the mark, it created an illusion of a near-certain Clinton win. Beyond the calculations of the candidates odds of winning the Electoral College, there was a near constant stream so-called horse race polls, or tracker polls, that focused on the distribution of the national vote between the major candidates. Here, too, pollsters  and the media that co-sponsored or covered the polls  stumbled, largely because the popular vote metric itself is of limited utility and cannot, of itself, predict the outcome of the Electoral College. As of Wednesday morning, Clinton led the popular vote by slightly less than 1 percentage point. The McClatchy-Marist poll released on Nov. 3, for example, had Clinton up by one point - one of the most accurate calls of the popular vote. But even that headline number missed the point a bit, because she lost the election in the Electoral College. A few polls correctly pegged Trump as the winner. The International Business Times/TIPP poll had Trump leading on Nov. 7. That poll put him ahead in the popular vote by two percentage points, which in the end overstated his share by about three points.  In one sense, most polls were relatively accurate: The Real Clear Politics average of polls, for example, had Clinton leading by about 3.3 points, little more than two points above the actual outcome. A polling error of two or three percentage points is not uncommon in modern politics. Popular vote polls, however, also exaggerate the influence of massive states, such as New York and California, in the outcome of the election and mask trends that might be occurring outside those left-leaning states.  The Electoral College system reduces the influence of big states by distributing a disproportionate number of votes to smaller states. North Dakota, for example, has about a quarter of one percent of the U.S. population but double that proportion of Electoral College votes. Conversely, Californians make up 12 percent of the population but only 10 percent of the Electoral College votes. Young said both pollsters and journalist described the results of the national polls and predictions with a false precision by presenting the result as near absolutes. The forecasting models, which assign probabilities or chances to candidates, are no better than the polls themselves, he said. If the polls are off, the forecasting models will be off, too. The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project website did offer an interactive tool that allowed users to adjust the polls estimate of turnout and play pollster themselves.  It also included one fixed scenario that showed how Trump could win - with a higher-than-expected Republican turnout and a lower-than-forecast Democratic turnout. That scenario, as it happened, better reflected what actually happened Tuesday. We need to recognize that there can be a range of possibilities, said Young. The trick of course is how to communicate that with the larger public. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
Unions brace for pro-business shift in labor policy under Trump,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Unions in the United States face sweeping changes to labor law and regulations under a new Republican administration that is expected to tilt policy toward employers.     Republicans will take control of the presidency and both chambers of Congress in Tuesdays elections, after unions failed to deliver key industrial states to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Clintons loss could have wide-ranging consequences for unions. Donald Trump and a Republican-led Senate will likely pick the next justice for the Supreme Court, which often hears labor-related cases.  I think its going to be a very difficult period, said Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, who said he was surprised by the election outcome despite knocking on doors and talking to members in several states.  Among his concerns, he listed a Supreme Court case this year in which public-sector unions scored a victory related to funding organized labor  but only because the court deadlocked 4-4. The appointment of a new conservative judge by Trump to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia could change that. Republican nominees will control the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which under Democratic President Barack Obama has sought to make it easier for unions to organize. The NLRB is pursuing litigation to establish that McDonalds Corp is a joint employer of workers at its franchised restaurants, a determination that could compel the company to bargain with unions representing employees of its independent franchisees.  Republicans will control federal agencies that govern the formation of unions, overtime rules and more. For example, in September the Obama administration finalized an executive order requiring federal contractors to provide sick leave to workers, as well as rules expanding the types of data employers are required to provide on pay. A separate Labor Department rule expanding which employees are eligible for overtime pay is scheduled to take effect next month. Those actions drew criticism from business groups, and all could be reversed under a Trump administration. We dont have a firewall now, said Tom Buffenbarger, a prior president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers who campaigned for Clinton.  Trump has expressed support for so-called right-to-work legislation, which allows workers to avoid paying union dues. Republican leaders in Congress have consistently sought such a change at the national level. Labor unions say such laws are aimed at undermining collective bargaining and workers rights. William Gould, chair of the NLRB under Democratic President Bill Clinton and now a professor at Stanford Law School, said on Wednesday that Trump was likely to partner with Congress in dismantling a host of administration labor initiatives from Obama.  Republicans regard unions as first amongst fair game because of their support for Clinton, he said. Steven Bernstein, a partner at law firm Fisher Phillips, which represents employers, said the Trump administration and Congress may also target recent NLRB rulings that allowed workers to picket on private property, expanded the type of worker activity protected by federal labor law and gave graduate students the right to unionize. Its also fair to assume that Trump will be inclined to repeal a host of executive orders supporting unions, particularly rules that apply to federal contracts, Bernstein said in a statement. Organized labor is a key Democratic constituency  contributing everything from volunteers to votes for Democratic candidates. Trump nonetheless carried union-heavy states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio and even Michigan, home to the United Auto Workers (UAW).  In Ohio, for example, a Fox exit poll said Trump won 52 percent of union workers. An exit poll from ABC News suggested Clinton got no advantage among union households, even after Obama won those voters by 23 percentage points. (abcn.ws/2eUMxpx) (fxn.ws/2eULxS8) David Lephart, a 58-year-old UAW pipefitter at a General Motors Co plant in Marion, Indiana, voted for Trump. He earns about $100,000 a year, with overtime, he says, and has put both of his kids through college.  He said union leaders pressed hard for members to support Clinton, but the union has nOt kept its promises to workers in recent years. I dont have a tendency to believe what you tell me  when you havent fulfilled the promises youve made, he said. UAW President Dennis Williams in a statement on Wednesday said, we have high hopes that elected officials heard the American people loud and clear about trade, jobs, education and the inequality in this country.

Mexico says does not expect Trump deportation plan to begin soon,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Deportations of undocumented Mexican migrants in the United States may start rising when President-elect Donald Trump takes office but the process will not begin soon, Mexicos deputy interior minister for migration said on Wednesday. Trump surged to victory early on Wednesday morning after upsetting pollsters predictions to beat Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and seize the White House in a campaign that sent the world into uncertainty. The impact of his win was particularly acute in Mexico, where the beleaguered peso currency fell about 10 percent in the aftermath of the vote. Trump, who will be inaugurated Jan. 20, has vowed to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, fence off Mexico with a border wall and threatened to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement, putting in danger billions of dollars in cross-border trade. It may well be that deportations of the estimated 6 million undocumented Mexicans increase but we dont think it will be a measure that will take place soon or happen quickly, Humberto Roque Villanueva, the deputy interior minister for migration, told Reuters in an interview. The Mexicans over there are useful to the North American economy and President Trump, the president-elect, will need to recognize the economic effects of such a campaign promise, he said. Roque Villanueva also said Mexico stands ready to lobby the U.S. Congress and use all legal means possible to block Trumps plan for impounding remittances so that Mexico ends up paying for his proposed wall on the southern U.S. border. They wouldnt be retaliatory measures. They would be legal responses, he said. Well be ready for all the craziness. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
Trump due in court before Oval Office,"(Reuters) - Within a few weeks of winning the White House, President-elect Donald Trump could face another group of U.S. citizens, a federal jury in California, courtesy of a lawsuit by former students of his now-defunct Trump University who claim they were defrauded by a series of real-estate seminars. A hearing in federal court in San Diego is set for Thursday, and the trial is scheduled to begin on Nov. 28, barring any delays or if Trump decides to settle the case.    While presidents enjoy immunity from lawsuits arising from their official duties, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that this shield does not extend to acts alleged to have taken place prior to taking office. The 1997 ruling came in the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against President Bill Clinton by Paula Jones, which was settled before it went to trial.  Lawyers said they could think of no similar situation like the one now involving Trump. Im certain there is nothing comparable to this, said    Alan Dershowitz, professor emeritus at Harvard Law School.  Lawyers for both Trump and the plaintiffs declined to comment on Wednesday. Dershowitz said the Supreme Court also held that a case cannot be delayed just because the defendant is president, though judges are still free to grant reasonable delays to any party. Miami trial consultant Sandy Marks, who is not involved in the case, said he thought Trump might ask the presiding judge, Gonzalo Curiel, to postpone the trial in an effort to settle the case before taking office. I think the judge would be foolhardy not to give him a short (delay), said Marks, which would give him a chance to resolve the case with all these people and put it behind him. Trump repeatedly claimed on the campaign trail that he would win the lawsuit, and he accused Curiel of being biased against him because of his campaign promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico. The judge was born in Indiana to Mexican parents. At the hearing on Thursday, lawyers will argue pre-trial motions, including one by Trump to block potential jurors from hearing comments made or publicized during the campaign, such as those about the judge. Lawyers for the students have argued the comments could help jurors assess Trumps credibility as a witness. Trump is listed as defense witness in the case and could be called to testify by the plaintiffs as well. He was previously deposed by the students lawyers.  Claims against Trump over the seminars date to 2010, with two class actions filed in federal court in San Diego and another case brought by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on behalf of students who claim they were misled into paying as much as $35,000 each to learn worthless real estate investing secrets from instructors hand-picked by Trump. Trump has admitted he did not hand-pick instructors, but has argued the claim was marketing language not meant to be taken literally. He claims most students were happy with their courses.  If the trial goes forward, several legal experts said it would be hard to seat an impartial jury, since so many people already have strong opinions about the president-elect. Parties often hire specialized jury consultants to pick jurors, but New York lawyer Robert Anello said they were not infallible. If experienced pollsters cant get it right, he said, how can a jury consultant who is not spending as much time studying the demographics? In an interview a day before the election, Jeffrey Goldman, a lawyer for Trump in the New York case, said the medias drumbeat of distortion about Trump University would make it hard to find impartial jurors. Several experts noted that jurors, who will answer a questionnaire in addition to being questioned by the lawyers and the judge, are generally taken at their word when they say they can be impartial. Boston jury consultant Edward Schwartz said he expects both sides to make an effort to vet jurors by their public social media postings. Dershowitz noted that San Diego, though located in deep-blue California, is not as politically monolithic as, say, San Francisco. It has an ethnically diverse population and also has a large military presence. This is a jury consultants nightmare to pick in a case like this, said Dershowitz. It will be taught in jury consulting school. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
"In election upset, Trump finds pockets of Latino support","MIAMI (Reuters) - Latinos angered by Donald Trumps tough stance on immigration could have been the Republican candidates biggest obstacle on the road to the White House.  As it turned out, the brash New York businessman won enough Hispanic votes in Tuesdays election to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton, with some Hispanics who supported him citing everything from ambivalence on immigration to conservative values and job growth. Reuters/Ipsos Election Day polling showed 28 percent of Americas Hispanic voters cast ballots for Trump, compared to 66 percent for Clinton, putting him on a par with Republican Mitt Romneys performance with the group in 2012. That outcome helped Trump upset Clinton in the critical battleground state of Florida, where he won 31 percent of Latino voters, while fending off challenges in border states such as Texas and Arizona.  Trumps win on Tuesday came as a blow to pro-immigrant advocates who had been hoping that his calls for mass deportations of undocumented foreigners, as well as a massive border wall with Mexico, would drive Latinos to the polls against him in a showcase of rising Hispanic political power. In our point of view, Latinos did their part to stop Trump, said Frank Sharry, executive director of immigrants rights group Americas Voice. But he added: Theres going to be a lot of finger pointing. On the streets of Miami overnight Tuesday, celebrations by Latino Trump supporters offered a glimpse of his appeal. He supports my values, said Humberto Quintero, 55, a Venezuelan-American who was among a large crowd celebrating outside Versailles Restaurant in a Cuban neighborhood in Miami, as cars passed honking their horns. He said Trumps promise to restore American manufacturing jobs was also an important issue for him. When I was young, everything was made in America, Quintero said. Now everything is made in China. He said he also backed Trumps plan for a wall. In your house you dont let everybody come inside without your permission, he said. Hispanics made up 17.6 of the U.S. population in 2015, up 12 percent from 2012, according to the U.S. Census, making them the countrys largest ethnic minority. By 2060, more than one-in-four people in America will be Latino.  President Barack Obama won 70 percent of the Latino vote during his 2012 re-election bid while his challenger Romney took 28 percent, the same as Trump this time around. Trumps relationship with Hispanic voters started on an awkward footing when he began his campaign in June 2015, calling for tighter borders and accusing Mexico of sending rapists and drug dealers into the United States. He insisted he would force Mexico to pay for a multi-billion-dollar wall along the border to keep unwanted foreigners out of the United States, and vowed to round up and deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country. Those positions, which became a cornerstone of his campaign,  resonated badly on Tuesday with many voters along the U.S. side of the Mexican border. When he said the Mexicans were rapists and all this, drug dealers and stuff, it did kind of hit a chord, said Jazmin Gonzalez, 31, a Mexican-American from the Barrio Logan neighborhood in San Diego who voted for Clinton. We know our people. Miguel Perez, 49, a maintenance engineer in Southern California who came to the United States from Mexico when he was 10, said he also voted for Clinton on Tuesday - mainly just to stop Trump. I would have voted for Donald Duck if I had to, he said after casting his ballot at San Ysidro High School near the border with Mexico. Clinton had sought to contrast her campaign with Trumps by advocating for a path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants living in the country. She also hired immigrant activists for her campaign and featured undocumented immigrants at rallies. But she and the Democratic Party had at times raised the ire of Latino activists by focusing too heavily on bashing Trump while putting forward less-than-substantive efforts to appeal directly to Latinos, and rejecting pressure to name an Hispanic running mate. Clintons socially progressive platform, including her support of abortion rights, also may have rankled some religious conservatives within the Hispanic community. Lilian Enriquez, 45, a pastor who voted in Tucson, Arizona, on Tuesday, declined to say who she supported. But she said her vote was based largely on her sense of morality. The United States is a country that has been cheapened morally, and I do not want to see ... people living a way that goes against the way of God, she said. Activist groups wanted to boost turnout among Latinos this year but figures are not yet in. In 2008, less than half of Latinos who were eligible to cast ballots actually did  and the rate dipped in 2012, according to the census. In contrast, the voting rates for white and black voters were both well over 60 percent. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
Anxious world leaders seek clarity on Trump policies,"LONDON (Reuters) - World leaders offered to work with Donald Trump when he takes over as U.S. president, but expressed anxiety over how he will handle problems from the Middle East to an assertive Russia and whether he will carry out a number of campaign threats. Several authoritarian and right-wing leaders hailed the billionaire businessman and former TV show host, who won the leadership of the worlds most powerful country against the odds in Tuesdays election. China, a target of Trumps ire during his campaign, appealed for cooperation. Mexico also struck a conciliatory tone, despite Trumps insults to Mexican migrants and pledges to build a wall to separate the two countries. South Korea urged him not to change policy on North Koreas nuclear tests. Trump, who has no previous political or military experience, said after defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton that he would seek common ground, not conflict, with the United States allies. In the election campaign, he voiced admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, questioned central tenets of the NATO military alliance and suggested Japan and South Korea should develop nuclear weapons to shoulder their own defense burden. Putin was among the first to send Trump congratulations. Ties between Washington and Moscow have become strained over the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, and allegations of Russian cyber attacks featured in the election campaign. It is not an easy path, but we are ready to do our part and do everything to return Russian and American relations to a stable path of development, said Putin, for whom an easing of U.S. economic sanctions would be a prize. Among other issues causing concern among allies are Trumps vows to undo a global agreement on climate change, ditch trade deals he says have been bad for U.S. workers, and renegotiate the nuclear accord between Tehran and world powers which has led to an easing of sanctions on Iran. Iran urged Trump to stay committed to the Iran deal. President Hassan Rouhani said the nuclear accord with six world powers could not be dismissed by one government. German Chancellor Angela Merkel  denounced by Trump as insane for allowing more than 1 million migrants into the country last year  added a stern note in her message of congratulations which hinted at a certain unease. Germany and America are bound together by values - democracy, freedom, respecting the rule of law, peoples dignity regardless of their origin, the color of their skin, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views, Merkel said. On the basis of these values, I am offering to work closely with the future President of the United States Donald Trump. In Britain, where Trumps victory had echoes of Junes referendum in which voters showed dissatisfaction with the political establishment by voting to leave the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May said the enduring and special relationship between the two countries would remain intact. But Scotlands first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, who has often expressed distaste for Trump, said many people in the United States and across the world would feel a real sense of anxiety. Nigel Farage, a leader of the Brexit campaign who spoke at a Trump rally during the election campaign, tweeted: I hand over the mantle to @RealDonaldTrump! Many congratulations. You have fought a brave campaign. Some European officials however took the unusual step of openly denouncing the outcome, calling it a worrying signal for liberal democracy and tolerance in the world. Were realizing now that we have no idea what this American president will do, Norbert Roettgen, the head of the German parliaments foreign affairs committee, said. President Francois Hollande said France wanted to begin talks with Trump immediately to clarify his stance on  international affairs. This American election opens a period of uncertainty, Hollande said. French officials had endorsed Clinton and warned that Trumps confused foreign policy objectives were alarming for the rest of the world. The U.S. is a vital partner for France and whats at stake is peace, the fight against terrorism, the situation in the Middle East, economic relations and the preservation of the planet, Hollande said. But like-minded right-wing European parties that are hoping to make inroads of their own in 2017  a year in which Germany, France and the Netherlands hold elections, and Italy and Britain could also do so  hailed Trumps victory.  Frances far-right National Front leader, Marine Le Pen, said she hoped the same kind of upset would happen in France. The Americans gave themselves a president of their choosing and not the one that the establishment wanted them to rubber-stamp, she said.  Mexican President Pena Nieto, who was criticized for receiving Trump in Mexico during the campaign, said he was ready to work with the president-elect. Mexico and the United States are friends, partners and allies and we should keep collaborating for the competitiveness and development of North America, Pena Nieto said. Trump has said he could tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), saying that it has killed U.S. jobs, and he called Mexican immigrants rapists during his campaign. Sounding conciliatory, Chinese President Xi Jinping said Beijing and Washington shared responsibility for promoting global development and prosperity. I place great importance on the China-U.S. relationship, and look forward to working with you to uphold the principles of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, Xi told Trump, who had pledged to take on China and to tax Chinese imports to stop currency devaluation. South Korea expressed the hope that Trump would maintain current U.S. policy of pressuring North Korea over its nuclear and missile tests. Seoul was concerned Trump may make unpredictable proposals to North Korea, a ruling party official said, quoting top national security officials. A Japanese government official, speaking before Trump clinched the election, urged him to send a message as soon as possible to reassure the world of the United States commitment to its allies. We are certainly concerned about the comments (Trump) has made to date about the alliance and the U.S. role in the Pacific, particularly Japan, the Japanese official said.  In the Middle East, Israels Benjamin Netanyahu, who had a poor relationship with President Barack Obama, said he hoped to reach new heights in bilateral ties under Trump. Obama and Netanyahu sparred over the issue of Israeli  settlements, while Trump has said they should expand. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas also congratulated Trump, but analysts said his rule may be profoundly negative for Palestinian aspirations. And despite Trumps negative rhetoric about Muslims during his campaign, including threats to ban them from the United States, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said he hoped the business magnates election would breathe new life into U.S.-Egyptian ties.

Republicans hold on to state legislative edge in U.S. election,"(Reuters) - Republicans will continue to dominate state legislatures in the wake of Tuesdays election, which kept their party in control of Congress and put Donald Trump in the White House, legislative analysts said on Wednesday. After an election in which more than 80 percent of 7,383 state legislative seats nationwide were up for grabs, Republicans and Democrats were likely to control the same number of chambers they had previously, according to the bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), which is still compiling voting results. Republicans, who have dominated control of legislatures since the 2010 mid-term election, held the majority in 67 of the countrys 98 partisan legislative chambers, while Democrats had 31 going into the election. Nebraskas single chamber is nonpartisan. Neither party can sort of boast of having a big night down on the state level, NCSL elections analyst Tim Storey said. Republicans will remain in a dominant position in terms of policy making. In Kentucky, Republicans took over the House of Representatives for the first time since 1921, while defeating longtime Democratic House Speaker Greg Stumbo, according to the Republican Legislative Campaign Committee. That result leaves Republicans in control of all 30 legislative chambers in the U.S. South for the first time in history, Storey said. Republicans also wrested control of the Iowa Senate and the Minnesota Senate from Democrats, according to NCSL. Democrats hit their target in the New Mexico House of Representatives, gaining a majority of seats, and took over both chambers of the Nevada Legislature. In Hawaii, the only Republican in the Senate was ousted, making the Democratic-controlled chamber the first all one-party state legislative chamber since 1980. One chamber, the Connecticut Senate, came out of the election tied. Democrats retained control of the Illinois Legislature but lost their veto-proof majority in the House after Republican Governor Bruce Rauner and his top donors invested tens of millions of dollars in a bid to weaken long-serving Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan. The control of the New York Senate was still undetermined, NCSL said. Missouris legislature and governors office will be totally under Republican control after Eric Greitens won the race to succeed term-limited Democratic Governor Jay Nixon. Vermont will be split with the election of Republican Phil Scott as governor. Republicans extended their majority of U.S. governorships in Tuesdays vote. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
"Pledging unwavering defence, NATO braces for Trump","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO promised on Wednesday to defend all allies despite election victor Donald Trumps call to set conditions for U.S. help, as the alliance braced for a more impulsive leader some fear could withdraw funding to deter Russia. During the presidential election campaign Trump threatened to abandon U.S. allies in Europe if they do not spend enough on defence, comments that were particularly unnerving for the ex-Soviet Baltic states on Russias border which fear Moscow might try a repeat of its 2014 annexation of Ukraines Crimea. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said NATOs promise to defend any ally under attack was an unconditional guarantee set out in the Western alliances founding treaty in 1949. All allies have made a solemn commitment to defend each other and this is something which is absolute and unconditioned, Stoltenberg told a news conference, saying he would try to speak to Trump by telephone as soon as possible and would welcome him to a NATO summit in Brussels next year. The U.S. commitment to NATO and the collective defence of Europe has been rock solid for almost 70 years and I am absolutely confident that it will still be the case, Stoltenberg said, noting that two world wars had shown the importance of stability in Europe to the United States. Trumps suggestion of making the United States defence of its Western allies conditional was the first time a leading presidential candidate had raised the idea, putting him directly at odds with NATOs 27 other member states.   Diplomats questioned how long NATOs chief would be able to maintain a business as usual tone with a new U.S. leader who has expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, condemned by the West for his actions in Ukraine. The idea that Trumps presidency is not going to create problems for NATO is delusional, said Dana Allin, a U.S. foreign policy expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation was founded around the central promise that an armed attack against one ally is an attack against all, whether it be on land, in the air or on the seas. NATO leaders in July added the area of cyberspace to that list of war fighting domains, although allies have to request NATOs help and decisions are on a case-by-case basis. Trump, a Republican who had never previously run for office, assumes the presidency on Jan. 20 after defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton in Tuesdays U.S. election. In one demonstration that not all U.S. Republicans share Trumps scepticism about NATO, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday he believes the NATO alliance is every bit as important today as it ever was. I think Article 5 (of the NATO treaty) means something: you attack any member of NATO, you have us to deal with. I want the Russians to understand that fully, McConnell said in Washington when a reporter asked him if he shared Trumps attitude toward the alliance and Russia.  One of NATOs top commanders stressed that the debate about the alliances role was not a theoretical one, given the powerful Russian air defence systems in the Baltic region, in Crimea and in Syria that could limit NATOs freedom of movement. Allies need to build up a sophisticated air deterrent that can counter Russian long-range missiles, said General Denise Mercer, whose brief is to focus on future threats.  After the fall of the Soviet Union a quarter of a century ago, NATOs European allies cut defence spending to historic lows, leaving the United States to make up around three quarters of the alliances military expenditure.  A newly assertive Russia under Putin has begun to change that and Europe is again spending more on defence. But Britain, Poland, Greece and Estonia are the only European nations to meet a NATO goal of spending at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defence. Germany, Europes biggest economy, spends far less than 2 percent of its GDP on defence. Asked if she would now seek more funding for Germanys military, Defence Minister Ursula von derv Leyden told Reuters: I have to make it clear (to German lawmakers) what our posture is, what we need and that is the right way to proceed. Stoltenberg said he expected an overall 3 percent real increase in European defence spending in 2016. He said if all European allies and Canada reached the 2 percent spending target it would generate an additional $100 billion for NATO.  On financial markets, shares in European defence companies rose as investors bet arms spending would rise in response to Trumps calls for Europe to pay more for its security. A first sign of Trumps tough stance could come as early as next year, when the United States is due to deploy troops and heavy combat equipment to eastern Europe under a $3.4 billion U.S. spending plan for Europe to deter Russia. Trump could scale back President Barack Obamas plan to quadruple funding under the European Reassurance Initiative (ERR) from just under $800 million - a significant investment in Europe after decades of cutting its presence in Europe.  France saw an opportunity to strengthen European defence. Donald Trump said he wanted to ... stop paying for NATO, so countries like Poland need to ask themselves (what this means), Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Assault said. Rather than lowering our heads, we must rise to the challenge. Trump has also threatened to withdraw U.S. forces from Europe if allies fail to pay more for U.S. protection, although U.S. ambassador to NATO Douglas Lute sought to reassure allies, saying: NATO has always been a bipartisan venture for the United States. Trump has said NATO could become obsolete if it does not focus more on Isla mist militant groups hostile to the West, an area that is not traditionally a core focus of the alliance. Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister whose own country borders Russia, sought to remind the new president-elect that the only time NATO has activated its Article 5 commitment was following the Septa. 11 attacks in 2001.

"Trump aide says no decision on Clinton prosecutor, now focused on unity","NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican President-elect Donald Trumps campaign manager on Wednesday said there has been no discussion of an appointment of a prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clintons past practices while serving as President Barack Obamas secretary of state, a threat Trump made in an election debate. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence are looking to unify the country, but we havent discussed that in recent days, and I think that its all in due time, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on MSNBC when asked about the appointment of a prosecutor.  Real estate developer and former reality TV host Trump stunned the world by defeating Democrat Clinton in Tuesdays U.S. presidential election. His four-year term starts on Jan. 20.  Asked on CNN about the possibility of a special prosecutor, Conway said: We didnt discuss that last night, and he did not discuss that with Hillary Clinton on the phone. Clinton called Trump to concede the race. During his victory speech in the early hours of Wednesday morning, Trump said it was time for American to bind the wounds of division.  Given Trumps promise to bring the country together, pursuing a case against Clinton could be a risky political strategy, said Katy Harriger, a political science professor from Wake Forest University in North Carolina. I cant imagine anything more divisive than going after someone who may have won the popular vote, said Harriger, whose work focuses on the role of special prosecutors in U.S. politics. The White House on Wednesday also pointed to the nations long history of not jailing political rivals in retribution. Appointing a prosecutor would also mean going against the recommendations of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  The agency, which had been investigating Clintons email practices, cleared her just two days ahead of the election and stood by its earlier finding that criminal charges were not warranted. During his second debate with Clinton on Oct. 9, Trump vowed to put Clinton in jail, attacking her for operating a private email server during her tenure as chief diplomat under Obama from 2009 to 2013, saying she had endangered national security.  Trump said, If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation. Because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. Under U.S. government regulations in place since 1999, the attorney general can appoint a special counsel because of a conflict of interest or because of other extraordinary circumstances.  Clinton, who has apologized over her use of a private server, defended herself at the St. Louis debate. If Trump chose to pursue an investigation, his appointee for attorney general would have broad discretion to assign a special counsel to the case, said Devin Schindler, a professor at Western Michigan Universitys Cooley Law School.  The White House, asked about Trumps pledge to jail Clinton, said such a move would be unprecedented. Weve got a long tradition in this country of ... people in power not using the criminal justice system to exact political revenge. In fact, we go to great lengths to insulate our criminal justice system from partisan politics, Obamas spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters at a daily news briefing.  That commitment has served our country very well for more than two centuries. And the president is hopeful that it will continue, he added.  Obama does have the ability to issue a pre-emptive pardon of Clinton that would shield her from prosecution, even though no charges have been filed against her, said legal experts.  Asked about such a possibility, Earnest said he could not speculate about any hypothetical pardons. After taking office, President Gerald Ford pardoned his predecessor, Richard Nixon, who had not been charged with a crime in the Watergate scandal, in an effort to move past the countrys polarization. But Obama might be hesitant to issue a pardon, and Clinton to accept one, because under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, the acceptance of a pardon is the functional equivalent of admitting guilt, said Schindler. Peter Zeidenberg, who served as deputy special counsel in the investigation of former Vice President Dick Cheneys chief of staff and national security adviser, Lewis Scooter Libby, over government leaks during the George W. Bush administration, said a special prosecutor would have to take evidence to a grand jury overseen by a judge. Given what is known about Clintons conduct, it is a nothingburger of a case, he said. Despite chants from Trump supporters at his campaign rallies to Lock her up, including at his election night victory party,  Zeidenberg and other legal experts said Trump may go back on his pledge to appoint a special prosecutor.  It sounds good at the time, so he says it, said  Zeidenberg. But he has changed his position so many times he is like a weathervane in a windstorm. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
"'France is not the U.S.,' presidential hopeful Juppe's camp says","BORDEAUX, France (Reuters) - The French never vote like the Americans, a politician told a rally for presidential favorite Alain Juppe on Wednesday as France wondered if it would be the next country to prove the opinion polls wrong. Juppe, mayor of the southwest city of Bordeaux and a former prime minister, has topped the polls for months. Surveys predict he will win both a primary later in November to be the center-rights candidate and the presidential election in six months. But after pollsters failed to predict U.S. voters would make Donald Trump their countrys 45th president, like their British colleagues who got the United Kingdoms vote to leave the EU wrong, France has started bracing for a possible surprise next year. Juppe is ahead in polls and he will also win. The French are not like the Americans, were not crazy, Juppe supporter Mbacoye Balde, 35, told Reuters at the Bordeaux rally. Nearby, another Juppe supporter carried a banner reading Ne vous Trumpez pas a French play on words with Trumps name  that meant Dont make a mistake.  Weve always been cautious about polls, weve always said one should not get carried away and it was not in the bag, Virginie Calmels, Juppes deputy in Bordeaux and one of his campaign spokespersons, said of his strong ratings.     But she added: Its not quite the same in France and in the United States. Unlike in the United States for the Trump vote, pollsters in France have recently tended to overestimate support for the anti-immigration National Front (FN), she said. The far-right party won no region in last years local elections, despite forecasts it would get at least one.  But its leader Marine Le Pen is another strong candidate in the presidential election and is expected to be one of the two contestants to make it into the runoff round - possibly against Juppe himself. Juppe told the rally that, if elected, he would obviously be available for dialogue with President Trump but spent much of his speech warning against populism, saying inclusiveness and hope were the answer.   Juppe is campaigning on a moderate platform more to the center than the law-and-order strategy of main rival Nicolas Sarkozy, who was Frances president in 2007-2012 and has courted controversy with his hard line on immigration and Islam. Without mentioning Sarkozy by name, Juppe said: Beware the false answers and bad solutions ... I say no to divisiveness, no to demagoguery that pit the French against one another.  I want the optimistic France to lift up the sad France, he said, just days ahead of the two-round primary on November 20 and 27 where he will compete against Sarkozy and five other candidates for the center-rights nomination.

"Clinton thanks staff, supporters behind historic bid for U.S. presidency","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton walked onto the ballroom stage Wednesday morning to do what many had considered unthinkable: thank her campaign staff after failing in her bid to become the first woman elected U.S. president, instead of the anticipated victory speech under a symbolic glass ceiling. Hundreds of staffers and supporters gathered at the New Yorker Hotel in midtown Manhattan to hear Clinton speak publicly for the first time after her bruising loss to New York real estate magnate Donald Trump in the early hours of the morning. Many wore the same clothes as the night before, having stayed up all night after leaving theglass-ceilinged Jacob J. Javits Convention Center, where Clintons final rally never materialized. Campaign Chairman John Podesta told the distraught crowd just after 2 a.m. to go home and expect to ultimately bring this home. Shortly after, news broke that Clinton had telephoned Trump to concede. As staffers and supporters filed into the ballroom, there were tears, hugs, and disbelief that Clinton, a former secretary of state, U.S senator and first lady, had again failed to shatter what she called the highest and hardest glass ceiling after her first attempt at the presidency in 2008, when she lost in her bid for the Democratic nomination. This time, Clinton won the Democratic primary race, becoming the first women to secure a major partys nomination in her race against U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. But in the final contest for the White House, she lost to Trump, the unorthodox Republican nominee. We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought, but I still believe in America and I always will, and if you do then we must accept this result and then look to the future, Clinton said, with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, daughter Chelsea Clinton and Chelseas husband, Marc Mezvinsky, at her side. Also on the stage were Clintons vice presidential pick, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton. Clinton wore a black suit with purple lapels - the color created by combining blue and red, the colors that symbolize the two major U.S. political parties - andnot the suffragette white that many expected Tuesday night.Bill Clinton wore a matching tie. Clinton urged her backers to seek unity in the wake of defeat. Donald Trump is going to be our president, we owe him an open mind and the chance to lead, she said. Likely facing her last opportunity for a presidential run, Clinton, 69, acknowledged the bitter sting of an election defeat in which initial results show she won the popular vote but came up short in the Electoral College vote that ultimately decides the race. Clinton had been leading Trump in public opinion polls for months, and in the final week of her campaign, her staff celebrated a drawn-out campaign marked with vitriol at star-studded rallies with performers such as Jon Bon Jovi, Jay Z and Beyonce.  But as election returns came in, Trump pulled off major upsets in key states including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida that Clintons campaign expected to win. Aides appeared visibly shaken as Tuesday night turned into Wednesday morning.  Hate trumps love, I guess, a supporter in the ballroom on Wednesday said, flipping the phrase Clinton had used to close her rallies. Clinton thanked her supporters - women and young people in particular - and urged them to never give up. Ive had successes, and Ive had setbacks, sometimes really painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your professional, public, political careers. You will have successes and setbacks too. This setback hurts, but please never stop believing that fighting for what is right is worth it, she said. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
Obama legacy imperiled as Trump weighs Supreme Court pick,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trumps presidential election victory all but dooms major Obama administration initiatives that are already tied up in legal challenges and gives him the chance to appoint a pivotal fifth conservative justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. Democratic President Barack Obamas signature 2010 healthcare law, his plan to combat climate change, his executive action on immigration, his transgender rights policy and other issues were challenged in court by Republicans and industry groups. (For a graphic on legal challenges to major Obama initiatives click tmsnrt.rs/2eznafM) A Trump administration could decide no longer to defend the policies in court after Trump takes office on Jan. 20. In addition, Trump and the incoming Republican-led Congress could simply repeal or rescind Obamas policies, as they have promised. Trumps Supreme Court appointment, possibly the first of multiple picks, would allow him to restore the decades-long conservative majority on the bench, which looked under threat when conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died in February. The shorthanded court currently is split with four conservatives and four liberals. Conservative activists may be emboldened to bring cases urging the court to support gun rights, uphold abortion restrictions and rule for religious rights. If you have a conservative court, you are going to have more conservative decisions, said Kerri Kupec, a lawyer with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group involved in religious rights cases. One issue the court could take up in the near term is whether business owners who oppose same-sex marriage can object on religious grounds to providing services to gay couples. One dispute concerns a baker in Colorado, while another involves a florist in Washington state. In the labor context, the high court could also revisit whether states can force nonunion workers to pay unions for collective bargaining activities. The court split 4-4 on the issue in March, just after Scalias death, in a loss for conservative groups challenging the practice. Liberal hopes of gaining a majority on the Supreme Court for the first time in decades lasted almost nine months, from Scalias death on Feb. 13 to Tuesday night. In a vindication of Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnells decision, with little precedent in U.S. history, to take no action on Obamas nominee to replace Scalia, appeals court judge Merrick Garland, Trump is now poised to nominate a new justice as soon as he takes office. His nominee would be considered for confirmation by a Republican-controlled Senate under McConnell. Trump may also be able to make further appointments to the court, with three justices 78 or older, including 83-year-old liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whom Trump called on to resign in July after she called him a faker and speculated about the possibility of moving to New Zealand if he won the White House. Fellow liberal Stephen Breyer is 78, while conservative Anthony Kennedy is 80. If Trump is able to replace Ginsburg or another liberal justice during his presidency, the courts conservative wing would be further strengthened. Such a majority could be a threat to important rights that have been protected in the past by the Supreme Court, said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a liberal legal group. She cited abortion rights and efforts at ensuring racial equality as examples. A conservative court, as it was with Scalia on the bench,  would likely be favorable toward gun rights, skeptical of abortion and supportive of the death penalty. If Democrat Hillary Clinton had won Tuesdays election, liberals may have been emboldened to challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and seek gun restrictions and limits on campaign spending, among other things.  Trump has already issued a list of 21 judges, mainly federal judges appointed by President George W. Bush and state court judges, he said he would consider to fill Scalias vacancy. All have conservative credentials on such issues as abortion, birth control and gun rights. The case that could be affected soonest by Trumps win  involves transgender rights. The court on Oct. 28 took up a case concerning a female-born transgender high school student named Gavin Grimm, who identifies as male and sued in 2015 to win the right to use the schools boys bathroom. Grimm is backed by the Obama administration. No date has been set for the argument in the case. The court could potentially delay acting until it has nine justices. A ruling could resolve similar litigation around the country over an Obama administration directive saying schools should allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their choosing. Trump has said he would rescind the Obama directive. He also has said he would rescind Obamas executive action to protect millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation and give them work permits, which was put on hold by the courts while the administration fights to revive it. Trump would be expected to overturn major regulations put in place under Obama, including the Clean Power Plan to curb greenhouse emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants. That process takes time, meaning the Supreme Court could potentially rule on a legal challenge to the Clean Power Plan before Trump can dump it. The case is pending before an appeals court in Washington. The Republican Congress under Trump could now seek to repeal Obamas signature healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act, but even if it does not, a Republican legal challenge that could cripple the law is pending before a federal appeals court in Washington.

North Carolina governor unwilling to concede in tight race,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - North Carolina Governor Pat McCrorys campaign criticized his Democratic challenger on Wednesday for claiming victory in the states neck-and-neck gubernatorial race, saying tens of thousands of votes had yet to be tallied. Roy Cooper, the states attorney general, declared victory after unofficial election results showed him leading the Republican incumbent by fewer than 5,000 votes in the largest of the 12 U.S. states that elected governors on Tuesday. If Coopers advantage holds, it would be the only governorship pick-up for Democrats nationally, while Republicans extended their dominance over state executive offices by flipping seats in New Hampshire, Missouri and Vermont. McCrorys campaign, however, said the outcome of the North Carolina race will not be known until outstanding absentee, military and provisionalballots are counted, a process expected to extend into next week. Claiming an outcomebefore the process has concluded isirresponsible and disrespectful to the voters of North Carolina whose voices have yet to be heard, McCrory campaign strategist Chris LaCivita said in a statement. The campaign and state Republican Party signaled that a legal fight could be ahead, calling into question why some 90,000 early votes in heavily Democratic Durham County were not uploaded until late Tuesday. LaCivita said Republicans had grave concerns over potential irregularities in that county. North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Robin Hayes said dozens of lawyers would be deployed across the state to ensure the validity of every vote cast. Democrats said they expected Cooper to maintain his lead. Last night, the people of North Carolina chose a new governor with new priorities, Coopers campaign spokesman Ford Porter said. The race in North Carolina was seen as effectively serving as a referendum on a state law that bans transgender people from using government-run restrooms that correspond with their gender identity and limits protections for gays and lesbians. McCrory signed the law, known as House Bill 2, and steadfastly supported its bathroom provision despite the economic backlash against the state after it passed in March. Cooper called the measure discriminatory and said it should be repealed. County elections boards will certify Tuesdays results on Nov. 18, state election officials said. If the race is decided by 10,000 or fewer votes, a candidate may request a recount. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
"Russia revels in Trump victory, looks to sanctions relief","MOSCOW (Reuters) - For all their mutual praise, Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump are likely to disagree on many things. But Trumps election win could hand Moscow an elusive prize - the lifting or easing of Western sanctions. Rolling back those sanctions, imposed by the United States and the European Union to punish Moscow for its 2014 annexation of Ukraines Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, could spur investment in Russias flat-lining economy. That might make it even easier for Putin, who is trying to plug holes in the state budget inflicted by low oil prices and sanctions, to win a fourth presidential term in 2018 by allowing him to show he has returned the economy to growth.  Clearly the chances of sanctions being lifted on Russia have risen substantially, Charles Robertson, Renaissance Capitals global chief economist, said. That would improve the investment climate for Russia. Russias rouble currency and stocks gained on the Trump election victory. Ukraines dollar-denominated bonds tumbled to multi-month lows, reflecting pessimism about what a Trump presidency means for the divided and indebted country. The Kremlin had been bracing for fraught relations if the White House had been won by Hillary Clinton - a politician Putin once accused of stirring up protests against him and who state media portrayed as an anti-Russian warmonger. Trump was portrayed in a more positive light. Putin described him as very talented and in Kremlin-backed media he was cast as a plucky political maverick. Still, few in Moscow had believed the Republican candidate would win, apart from a group of Trump-supporting nationalists who gathered in a Moscow bar decorated with a triptych of Putin, Trump and French Front National leader Marine Le Pen. Once it became clear he had won, Russias parliament erupted in applause and Putin told foreign ambassadors he was ready to fully restore ties with Washington. State TV ran a clip of a Russian doppelganger of Trump taunting a cowed Clinton lookalike and Margarita Simonyan, the boss of RT, the Kremlins English-language TV news channel, said she would drive around Moscow with a U.S. flag to celebrate. But Russian glee was tempered by a recognition that Trumps pre-election promises might be diluted and that deep contradictions between Moscow and Washington would remain, even if Trump and Putin adopt a friendly tone in public. Trumps attempts to ease restrictions on doing business with Russia could also be constrained by Congress, which has shown it has little patience for the Kremlins military adventures. Executives with Western firms say the biggest obstacle to deals with Russia is not the sanctions themselves but the prospect that more could be imposed and the zeal with which existing sanctions are enforced. If a Trump White House were to send a signal to businesses that it was taking a more lax approach, investments could start flowing again with sanctions still in place. A softer U.S. stance could also weaken European sanctions resolve. The blocs measures have already started to look wobbly, with some member states finding ways to circumvent them, others saying it is time to discuss moving on, and some business groups in countries such as Germany lobbying against them. Until now, Washington has helped stiffen European resolve. When Russia placed a Eurobond in May this year, many European banks decided not to take part because they did not want to fall foul of U.S. financial regulators. America was the leader there and amazingly has been able to hold Europe together (on sanctions), political analyst Masha Lipman told Reuters. With Donald Trump in the White House I think there may be changes, something that might be beneficial for Russia. Putin needs sanctions lifted as they risk hurting his re-election prospects. Russias central bank is forecasting economic growth of up to 1 percent next year, well below the level Russian households have come to expect. After previous slumps, recoveries have been driven by foreign lending and investment. There are already some signs that the economy is hurting support for Putin, a trend that is only likely to grow in the 18 months until the Russian presidential election. Kremlin-watchers said that, even if U.S.-relations were less antagonistic with Trump in the White House, any deal would involve hard bargaining on both sides. Russia is seeking formal recognition from the world that Crimea, part of Ukraine, is now Russian territory, something it has only got so far apart from a handful of nations. It also wants Kiev to do more to implement a peace deal covering eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists hold sway. In Syria, where Russia is helping President Bashar al-Assad fight a war with air strikes and military assistance, Moscow wants the West to drop ideas about changing the government, abandon help for what it says are hardline Islamists, and drop talk of possible no-fly zones. One possibility is a quid pro quo, with Russia making concessions on Syria in exchange for the United States ceding ground on Ukraine and sanctions. For Russia the key point is Ukraine. If Trump says that America does not care about Ukraine, then that is all that Russia wants to hear right now, Georgy Bovt, editor of the Russkiy Mir magazine, told Reuters. On Syria it will be easier to reach a deal. I think that on Assad, Russia will be willing to compromise because Ukraine is more important for Russia. Much has been made in Russian and Western media of the perceived similarities and differences between Putin and Trump, who have never met. Both are fond of tough talking and some Russian politicians have suggested the pair might be able to forge a close working relationship similar to the one the Russian leader enjoyed with former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.  Trump has said he might even meet Putin before his inauguration. Putins spokesman said there were currently no plans for such a meeting.   People familiar with both mens leadership styles advised caution however, saying both were relatively thin-skinned when it came to criticism. Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a think-tank close to the Foreign Ministry, told Reuters the fact that Trump was an untested politician would also be a worry for the Kremlin. Hes a loose cannon and you never know what to expect from him, he said. There were also concerns the two men might be too alike.  The problem is that both of them, Putin and Trump, are macho, Sergei Markov, a Kremlin-connected analyst and former pro-Putin lawmaker, told Reuters. They could try to take the measure of each other. We cant let that happen. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1

"Trump win boosts coal, hits renewable stocks","MARRAKESH, Morocco/CHICAGO (Reuters) - The prospect of an abrupt shift in U.S. climate policy under President-elect Donald Trump lifted the shares of U.S. mining equipment giant Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), North American railroads and other companies tied to fossil fuels, and slammed shares of renewable energy firms. Trump has called climate change a hoax, said he would rip up the Paris climate treaty and promised to revive the U.S. coal sector. His victory caused dismay at a climate policy conference in Morocco on Wednesday. In the United States, the prospect of a sharp turn in U.S. environmental policy helped boost Caterpillar shares by more than 7 percent on Wednesday on hopes that a Trump administration would reinvigorate coal mining and investment in infrastructure. A mining slump has depressed Caterpillars profits and forced rounds of layoffs.    The Obama administration has pursued emissions rules designed to discourage coal-fired power plants, while Trump has said he would revive the coal industry and roll back regulation. There is bountiful evidence that free trade, tax reform, infrastructure investment and smart regulation are critically important to manufacturers success, Caterpillar said in a statement.  Shares in farm and equipment maker Deere & Co (DE.N) and truck makers Paccar Inc (PCAR.O) and Navistar International Corp (NAV.N) also rose, as did oil stocks.  Railroads Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC.N) and Union Pacific Corp rose 3.3 percent and 4 percent respectively. U.S. railroads have suffered as coal shipments have declined.  Obviously this is good news for fossil energy and coal in particularly, said National Mining Association spokesperson Luke Popovich. We will have a profound shift in policy. And hopefully spur development in low emission and higher efficiency technologies which make coal cleaner to use.  Regulation and federal policies are not the only challenge for coal.  A new administration may result in less regulatory pressure for utilities, the competition offered by natural gas doesnt change, said Michael Trevino, spokesman for No. 2 U.S. railroad BNSF, which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway Inc(BRKa.N).  Trumps victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton cast a dark cloud over delegates attending a 200-nation meeting in Marrakesh being held from Nov. 7-18 to celebrate the start of the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming last Friday.  Some delegates expressed concern that Trump could cause other nations to reconsider their position on global warming. Trump has said climate change was an invention by China and wants instead to promote jobs in the U.S. fossil fuel industry. We will have a lot more hurdles, said Ian Fry, head of the delegation of Tuvalu, a Pacific island state which fears rising sea levels, adding Trumps victory could have a domino effect on other nations. The Paris Agreement allows all nations to set national targets to slow climate change and some could scale those back. There are no sanctions for non-compliance. Many nations vowed to push ahead despite Trump with the sweeping plan to phase out net global greenhouse gas emissions between 2050 and 2100 by shifting from coal and oil to cleaner energies such as wind or solar power. Still, Trumps victory drove down renewable energy stocks. Shares in Vestas (VWS.CO), the worlds biggest wind turbine maker, were down 6.2 percent in mid-morning, while German peer Nordex (NDXG.DE) traded 6.6 percent lower. In the United States, Silicon Valley electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc(TSLA.O) sank 3.4 percent to its lowest price since February. Tesla benefits from federal tax breaks for electric vehicles and selling credits generated under a California electric vehicle policy. Other renewable shares were also hit. Spains Gamesa GAM.MC, which is being merged with Siemens (SIEGn.DE), and Portugals EDP Renovaveis (EDPR.LS) traded 2.4 and 5.2 percent lower, respectively. Stephanie Pfeifer, CEO of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, a European forum for 128 investors with more than 13 trillion euros in assets, said changes towards greener growth were irreversible. Renewables have already overtaken coal as a global power source, electric vehicles are the growth segment of the auto industry and jobs are being created in clean energy sectors faster than any other, she said.

Obama on Trump victory: we are now all rooting for his success,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama pledged on Wednesday to work for a smooth transition of power with president-elect Donald Trump, the Republican winner of Tuesdays election, who has promised to undo Obamas top domestic and foreign policy initiatives. In brief remarks to reporters in the White House Rose Garden, Obama urged fellow Democrats to put aside their disappointment and tried to strike a positive tone after a devastating electoral defeat. It is no secret that the president-elect and I have some pretty significant differences, Obama said with a smile about Trump, who had long questioned whether Obama had been born in the United States and his eligibility for office. We are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country, Obama said. Obama and his wife, Michelle, campaigned hard for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to defeat Trump, acknowledging that the presidents legacy on healthcare, climate change and financial reforms were on the line. But Obama kept his remarks on Wednesday focused on ensuring a successful transition for Trump, noting that his Republican predecessor, former President George W. Bush, had done the same for him eight years ago. Everybody is sad when their side loses an election, but the day after we have to remember that were actually all on one team, Obama said. I want to make sure that handoff is well executed because ultimately were all on the same team, Obama said. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
"Some Americans look to Canada, NZ as Trump surges to victory","TORONTO/WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Canadas main immigration website remained down on Wednesday and New Zealand reported increased traffic to its website for residency visas from U.S. nationals as Donald Trump surged to victory in the U.S. presidential election. Americans have often vowed to leave the country if their chosen candidate doesnt win the election, but this time around some are actually preparing to do so after Trump stunningly won the Nov. 8 election. A spokeswoman for Canadas immigration department said the website crashed as a result of a significant increase in the volume of traffic as election results rolled in Tuesday night. Bonnie Quinn, a New Jersey insurance underwriter planning to move to Canada with her husband said she felt just downright embarrassed by the election results. Im not sure in what order we should do things - find jobs first or move, said Quinn, 35, whose Irish grandparents once immigrated to Canada. In New Zealand, immigration officials said the New Zealand Now website, which deals with residency and student visas, had received 1,593 registrations from United States citizens since Nov. 1  more than 50 percent of a typical months registrations in just seven days.  Rod Drury, the chief executive of NZ-based global accounting software firm Xero, said the statistics matched up with interest his company has been seeing from prospective U.S. national employees concerned about a Trump win.  Drury said what started as a joke was becoming a reality.  Ive got lots of messages coming through at the moment asking for a job in New Zealand, and were saying Yes you can, Drury told Reuters by telephone on Wednesday. In the hours after Trumps victory, Americans were searching for jobs in Canada at 10 times the rate of previous nights, said Jed Kolko, chief economist for job website Indeed. Its far too soon to guess how many of these searchers will make a move after the shock wears off. But the jump in searches shows how many Americans were surprised by Trumps victory and are thinking about their options elsewhere, Kolko said in an emailed statement. In Atlanta, business coach Nancy Chorpenning, 62, said she and her husband are looking to move to Costa Rica sooner than their planned retirement because of the Trump victory. I am simply terrified the new administration and Congress may destroy the Social Security we count on when my husband retires, said Chorpenning, who is traveling to Costa Rica next week to scout for condos. After some Americans, often jokingly, said they would move to Canada if Trump was elected, the idea was taken up by some Canadian communities.  In February, the island of Cape Breton on Canadas Atlantic coast marketed itself as a tranquil refuge for Americans seeking to escape should Trump capture the White House. On Maple Match, a recently-launched dating website aimed to match Americans fleeing Trump with Canadians, users have more than doubled to about 14,000 overnight, according to chief executive Joe Goldman. While the pledge to move to Canada has been made in elections past, it has rarely played out, although thousands of Americans who opposed the Vietnam War moved to Canada. Migration data from after Republican George W. Bushs 2000 election and 2004 re-election - other moments when liberal Americans pledged to move to Canada in protest - suggest few followed through on their promises.  While immigration to Canada increased during the years of Bushs elections, the rise was not more than increases in other years, data from the Montreal-based Association for Canadian Studies show.

California voters turn down drug pricing initiative,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California voters turned down a ballot initiative aimed at reining in rising prices for prescription drugs after pharmaceutical companies spent more than $100 million to fight it. The California Drug Price Relief Act, also known as Proposition 61, sought to limit state health programs from paying more for medications than the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which receives the steepest discounts in the country.  As of Wednesday morning, with more than 99 percent of precincts partially reporting from Tuesdays election, the vote was 46 percent in favor of the measure and 54 percent opposed, according to Californias Secretary of State. The pharmaceutical companies spent a lot to defeat this, said Stuart Schweitzer, professor of health policy and management at the University of California, Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health. They wanted to draw a line in the sand. The measures defeat reaffirms the power of the biopharma lobby, Jefferies analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note to investors on Wednesday. The rising cost of prescription drugs came under attack during the U.S. presidential campaign. Both President-elect Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton called for cost-trimming measures including allowing Medicare, the federal health plan for seniors, to negotiate prices with drugmakers. Shares in pharmaceutical and biotechnology shares, under pressure in recent weeks, soared on Wednesday as market fears of a win by Clinton and Democrats gaining power in Congress receded. The Nasdaq Biotechnology index .NBI advanced 7 percent and was on track for its biggest single-day gain in about five years.     Proposition 61s opponents, led by global drugmakers such as Pfizer Inc and Amgen Inc, spent around $106 million. They argued that it would benefit only 12 percent of Californians, while putting the other 88 percent, and veterans across the country, at risk of higher drug costs. Supporters, led by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and AARP, which advocates for seniors, said only drug companies themselves can raise prices for veterans or other consumers. Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders also campaigned in support of Proposition 61, calling on voters to stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry. Proponents, who raised $17 million to support the initiative, estimated it could save California taxpayers up to $5.7 billion over 10 years, although a state legislative analysis said the financial impact is not clear. UCLAs Schweitzer said the measure would have had only a modest impact on state drug costs. There were also questions about how Proposition 61 would be implemented. The VAs mandated prices are listed publicly, but its steepest negotiated price discounts are required by law to be confidential. The VA spends some $6.1 billion a year on medicines for 6 million veterans. Proposition 61 would have extended those discounts to around 4.5 million Californians, including certain members of the states low-income Medicaid plan, state employees and retirees, university teachers and prisoners. A similar proposition has been approved for Ohios 2017 November ballot.  ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1

Melania's Slovenian hometown eyes Trump win as boon for tourism,"SEVNICA, Slovenia (Reuters) - The small Slovenian town of Sevnica, Melania Trumps birthplace, savored her husbands shock win in the U.S. election as a likely boon for tourism on Wednesday, while a former schoolmate remembered her as creative and innovative. Until about a year ago, the town of fewer than 5,000 people, nestled in the foothills of the Alps, was scarcely known in Slovenia, let alone abroad.   But on Monday, Sevnica was clearly looking forward to a financial spin-off from being the hometown of the 46-year-old future U.S. First Lady. Sometimes the pressure of the media was too hard. The people of Sevnica are not used to it. On the other hand, the global attention is positive because Sevnica is developing into a tourist destination, mayor Srecko Ocvirk said. Speaking to Reuters shortly after 7 a.m. (0600 GMT) in Sevnicas Central cafe, the smiling mayor said local residents had supported Trump and his wifes campaign. We are very satisfied at the result, he said. Born Melania Knavs in 1970, she lived in an apartment block in Sevnica with her family as a child. When she was a teenager, the family moved to a modest two-storey house above the Sava river on the outskirts of town, which sits below a well-maintained medieval castle. Residents say her father sold car parts and her mother worked for a factory that made a brand of childrens clothing very popular in communist Yugoslavia, before the country fell apart in the 1990s. Melanias modeling career took her to Milan and thence to the United States, far away from her native Slovenia, a tiny former Yugoslav republic of 2 million people comparable in size to New Jersey. Even as a child Melania was creative, innovative and Sevnica was too small for her, said Mirjana Jelancic, Melanias friend who is now a headmistress of Melanias elementary school. She was reserved and when I heard that Donald was running I said (to myself) this will be hard for her. She never wanted to be in the spotlight, Jelancic said. She was excellent at her job (in the campaign). The head of the towns health center, which received a donation from Melania in 2005 when she was pregnant with her son Barron, said she believed Melania would be a success in the White House, as well. Melania will be an excellent First Lady who will take Slovenian values of generosity, loyalty and trust to the United States and the world, Vladimira Tomsic said.

Republicans defend grip on U.S. Congress as Trump wins presidency,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans maintained their majorities in both chambers of the U.S. Congress in a momentous election on Tuesday in which Republican Donald Trump won the presidency, empowering the party to reshape Washington. The Republican sweep sets up the United States for two years of unified government, which would normally mean significant policy change, although Trumps election was anything but normal and he will start his presidency with unusual handicaps.  Both Republican leaders on Capitol Hill held Trump at arms length during the campaign. Trump offended and attacked some congressional Republicans on the stump, including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan. Early on Wednesday, shortly after Clinton conceded to Trump, Ryan said in a statement: We are eager to work hand-in-hand with the new administration to advance an agenda to improve the lives of the American people. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, also a Republican,  said in a guarded and similarly timed statement: The American people have chosen a new direction for our nation. The new Congress will not convene until Jan. 3, but the lame-duck Congress will return next week and Republicans are set to begin the process of picking leaders for both chambers. Ryans position as speaker could be challenged by Republican conservatives who backed Trump and it remains to be seen if the president-elect himself will try to push Ryan out. Trump seems magnanimous right now, an aide to one of Trumps House supporters said after Trump stressed unity in his victory speech in New York. We shall see. In a huge disappointment to Democrats, Republicans were on a pace to lose only a handful of seats in the House, well below the double-digit losses some predicted. Similarly, Democrats gained only one seat in the Senate, although a few races were still to be determined, including New Hampshire, where incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte was deadlocked with Democrat Maggie Hassan early on Wednesday. In Illinois, Democratic U.S. Representative Tammy Duckworth defeated Republican Senator Mark Kirk. Democrats needed to pick up a net five seats to win Senate control. Republican successes came on the heels of big Republican gains in the 2014 congressional elections and defied predictions the party was in tatters and on the verge of splitting apart because of deep divisions over Trump. Congressional Republicans are sure to flex their muscles on a range of legislation, not the least of which is fulfilling a six-year quest to repeal President Barack Obamas landmark healthcare law known as Obamacare. Republicans also campaigned on an agenda that shunned comprehensive immigration reform and opposed gun control and expanded environmental and financial regulations. In the Senate, McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, was expected to remain at his post for at least the next two years. Paul Sracic, who chairs the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said: There was all this concern that Trump would damage Republicans down-ticket. Just the opposite happened as Trump brought out more Republican voters. Come January, Republicans will have to pivot from trying to block Obamas initiatives - such as his signature health insurance program Obamacare - to governing along with Trump. Republicans no longer have the luxury of being the opposition party, said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University. For example, will they actually repeal Obamacare and agree what to implement in its place? she added. McConnell led conservatives opposition to any Supreme Court nominee named by Obama following last Februarys death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. His gamble paid off and he will now await a nomination from Trump, likely dooming Obamas choice of federal judge Merrick Garland. Star-power incumbent Republicans, such as Senator John McCain in Arizona and Marco Rubio in Florida, also scored victories.  Issues ranging from tax cuts to border security will now take center stage in Washington. Trumps opposition to trade deals with foreign countries puts in serious jeopardy the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement negotiated by Obama that would cover economies from Japan to Chile. In terms of trade, I think TPP is dead. The stake went through its heart tonight, Sracic said. ",politicsNews,"November 8, 2016 ",1
Speaker Ryan pledges to work with Trump on bold agenda,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who sparred with Donald Trump at times during his presidential campaign, pledged on Wednesday to work closely with the president-elect to forge an aggressive Republican legislative agenda from the outset of 2017. At a news conference in his hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin, Ryan said he and Trump are arranging a meeting to discuss the transition to a new Congress and administration, as well as the Republican agenda for the lame-duck session of Congress that begins on Monday. Tuesdays election results will give the Republicans simultaneous control of the White House, Senate and House for the first time since early 2007. He just earned a mandate and we now just have a unified Republican government, Ryan said of Trump. The opportunity is now here. And the opportunity is to go big, to go bold and to get things done. Ryan said he expected his six-point A Better Way blueprint to provide a framework for future action. The plan, which House Republicans used an election platform, calls for initiatives that include repealing and replacing Obamacare, reforming the U.S. tax code and scaling back federal regulations on industry.  Ryan had been slow to endorse Trump for president and clashed with the wealthy businessman over his incendiary campaign rhetoric, accusing him of making comment that was the textbook definition of racism about a judge of Mexican heritage. Last month Trump described Ryan as a very weak and ineffective leader. But on Wednesday Ryan said he and Trump had held two fantastic conversations in the past 18 hours. Ryans aim is to make sure that when his hand comes off the Bible, when he is sworn in as president, we are hitting the ground running. Ryan said Republicans in Congress also would coordinate with Trump on the upcoming lame duck session on what can be achieved.  The speaker also said it was time for redemption, not recrimination and dismissed concerns about civil liberties created by Trump campaign talk. Donald Trump heard a voice out in this country that no one else heard. He connected in ways with people no one else did. He turned politics on its head, Ryan said. Donald Trump provided the kind of coattails that got a lot of people over the finish line so that we could maintain our strong House and Senate majorities. There had been speculation Ryan would not run for the speaker job in January but last week his staff said he would run for re-election to the post. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1

Soda taxes spread after votes in four U.S. cities,"(Reuters) - Three California cities voted for a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages and another in Colorado was likely to follow suit, unofficial election results showed on Wednesday, as local governments push to cut soda consumption to stem obesity gathered speed. The votes on so-called soda taxes in San Francisco, Albany and Oakland in California and in Boulder, Colorado, came a month after the World Health Organization recommended governments impose such taxes to battle obesity, diabetes and other diet-related diseases. Tax proponents have recorded a series of victories in the United States this year, after numerous failed attempts.      Opponents argue that the taxes hit lower-income populations hardest, and that it is unfair to single out soda in the battle to fight obesity and diabetes. They also question the effectiveness of such taxes. Larry Tramutola, a California political strategist who  organized the pro-tax campaigns in San Francisco and Oakland, said the victory was huge, adding: This is the start of a national movement. Philadelphia earlier this year passed a levy on soft drinks, pitched as a way to fill a budget shortfall via a tactic that other politicians and advocates have also adopted. Im sure that other cities and states will look at this and put tax measures before their legislatures, said Michael Jacobson, co-founder and president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington. Legislators will say, We get a twofer: balance the budget and improve public health. The next soda tax vote is set for Cook County, Illinois, on Thursday. Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc. and other companies in the roughly $100 billion U.S. soft drink industry are fighting the taxes at a time when soda consumption is falling. They point instead to their efforts to reformulate products and broaden the range of drinks they offer to address consumers health concerns. More than one-third of U.S. adults are obese. Our energy remains squarely focused on reducing the sugar consumed from beverages, a spokeswoman for the American Beverage Association said in an emailed statement.  Shares in Pepsi  and Coca Cola  were both down nearly 2 percent, while Dr. Pepper Snapple Group was off 3.4 percent on Wednesday as the Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.9 percent. Spending from both camps has soared this year as billionaire advocates for the tax, including former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, joined the fray. For soda companies, the effects of the taxes on volumes and profits may be muted. In Mexico, which introduced a tax in 2014, per capita consumption dropped after the tax was introduced. But the impact on companies like Pepsi was offset by population growth and strong demand of non-fizzy beverages. This is more of a headline risk than a fundamental risk. It doesnt have an enormous impact on the companies themselves, as long as the (size of) taxes are within the realm of reason, said Ali Dibadj, analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein in New York. Long-term, the effects could be greater if the taxes are increased and if more jurisdictions introduce them. In San Francisco, Oakland and Albany, the taxes will be a penny per ounce, the same as in neighboring Berkeley, where voters passed a levy in 2014. In Boulder, the vote was for a 2-cent-per-ounce tax. The San Francisco measure passed 62 percent to 38 percent and the Albany measure passed 71 percent to 29 percent. The Oakland measure had 61 percent in favor and 39 percent opposed, and in Boulder the soda tax was passing 54 percent to 46 percent, with over three-quarters of the ballots counted.

Swiss right-wing's Blocher: Trump win a warning to world establishment,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Donald Trumps U.S. election victory, on the heels of Britains vote to exit the European Union, was fuelled by voters who feel neglected and shunned by establishment leaders, prominent Swiss right-winger Christoph Blocher said on Wednesday.  Blocher, a top official in the anti-immigration Swiss Peoples Party who engineered its ascent to become the biggest faction in the Swiss parliament, said Trumps win over Democrat Hillary Clinton was a warning to current world leaders not to go over citizens heads on issues including immigration. People feel powerless against those who rule them, and for them, Trump is a release valve, Blocher said in an interview. The unexpected result ... should give pause to those who are in power around the world.  Next year, the Netherlands, France and Germany - and possibly Italy and Britain too - will hold elections in which debate is likely to be driven by populist parties over issues including immigration. [nL8N1D83Q4] That was also a central theme in Britains June 23 Brexit vote to end 43 years of EU membership.

Pakistanis worry that President Trump may favor rival India,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Donald Trumps surprise election as U.S. president has Pakistanis wary that he may accelerate what they see as a shift in American policy to favor arch-foe India in the long rivalry between nuclear-armed neighbors, analysts said on Wednesday. Historical allies in the region, Islamabad and Washington have seen relations sour over U.S. accusations that Pakistan shelters Islamist militants, a charge Pakistan denies. They hit new lows in May when a U.S. drone killed the leader of the Afghan Taliban movement on Pakistani territory. At the same time, Pakistans ties with traditional rival India have also deteriorated this year, with India saying Pakistan-based militants killed 19 of its soldiers in a September attack on an army base in the disputed Kashmir region. To many Pakistanis, Trumps anti-Muslim rhetoric - he once proposed banning Muslims entering the United States - and business ties to India are signs that his administration could shift further toward New Delhi. America will not abandon Pakistan, but definitely, Trump will be a tougher president than Hillary Clinton for Pakistan, said Hasan Askari Rizvi, Lahore-based foreign policy analyst. I think India will have a better and smoother interaction compared to Pakistan. Trump has yet to lay out a detailed policy for South Asia, although he recently offered to mediate between India and Pakistan in their dispute over the divided territory of Kashmir. He also told Fox News in May he would favor keeping nearly 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan because its adjacent and right next to Pakistan which has nuclear weapons. On Wednesday, a U.S. diplomat in Pakistan sought to assure the country that Trumps election did not signal a drastic policy change. Our foreign policy is based on national interest and they dont change when the government changes, Grace Shelton, U.S. Consul General in Karachi, told Geo News television. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif congratulated Trump. Your election is indeed the triumph of the American people and their enduring faith in the ideals of democracy, freedom, human rights and free enterprise, Sharif said in a statement. Still, the uncertainty of a Trump presidency has many Pakistanis on edge, even if the country has leaned towards China in recent years for investment and diplomatic support. Trump is a bit of a wild card, said Sherry Rehman, a Pakistani senator and former ambassador to the United States.   Pakistan obviously cannot rule out engaging with whomever America elects, but his anti-Muslim rhetoric may cast a shadow on relations in times of uncertainty. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also congratulated Trump on Wednesday.  We look forward to working with you closely to take India-US bilateral ties to a new height, Modi said in a tweet. Trump has partnered with Indian businessmen on a handful of real estate ventures, but apart from courting the Indian-American vote he has not articulated how he would develop the bilateral relationship. India-U.S. ties have flourished under President Barack Obama and Modi, who came to power in 2014, with the two countries striking key defense agreements this year. Modis government has also waged a campaign to isolate Pakistan diplomatically. Shaurya Doval, director of the India Foundation, a think-tank close to Modis government, called Trumps election a very positive development, but added that India and the United States would have continued to grow closer under a Hillary Clinton presidency as well. My sense is that India-U.S. relations are not dependent on individuals  there are strong institutions and processes there, he said. One fringe Hindu nationalist group in India held a victory gathering at New Delhis speakers corner on Wednesday. Hes an American nationalist. We are Indian nationalists. Only he can understand us, Rashmi Gupta of the Hindu Sena, or Hindu Army, told Reuters. We expect him to support us when it comes to terrorist attacks on India from Pakistan. Trump will also have to decide whether to maintain the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan or change the scope of the mission, 15 years after a U.S.-led campaign toppled the hardline Islamist Taliban government.  The United States has spent some $115 billion in aid for Afghanistan since 2002, but the country is still caught in conflict, with a third of the country out of government control and thousands of Afghan civilians, soldiers and police dying every year. Afghan officials have voiced concern that the conflict is being forgotten in Washington, and warned privately that the West will pay a huge price if that continues.  The people of Afghanistan are tired of war. We want (Trump) to invest heavily in bringing peace to war-torn Afghanistan and stabilize our region, said Umer Daudzai, former Afghan minister of interior. Obamas original aim of pulling out of Afghanistan entirely has been put on hold in the face of mounting gains by Taliban militants, with U.S. air power and special forces still regularly involved in combat.  As recently as last week, two U.S. Green Berets were killed near the northern city of Kunduz. Although Afghan security forces have been fighting largely alone since the end of the main NATO-led combat mission in 2014, their performance has been patchy and they continue to rely heavily on U.S. air power. The Taliban on Wednesday urged Trump to withdraw all U.S. troops. They should not cause damage to their economy and their military in this failed war, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said of the American government in a statement.

"At under $5 each, Trump's votes came cheap","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump pulled off one of the biggest upsets in American political history when he toppled Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday - and he did it using far less cash than his rival.  Relying heavily on an unorthodox mix of social media, unfiltered rhetoric, and a knack for winning free TV time, the New York real estate businessman likely paid less than $5 per vote during his insurgent White House bid, about half what Clinton paid, according to a Reuters analysis of campaign finance records and voting data. Those figures assume the candidates spent all the funds they raised.  Trumps cost-effective win has upended prevailing concepts about the influence of money in American politics and raised the question of whether a lean, media-savvy campaign can become the new model for winning office in the United States.  Political strategists and academics tend to agree, however, that Trumps performance would be tough to repeat.A household name for his luxury brand resorts, reality TV stardom, and ability to surround himself with non-stop controversy, Trump held advantages that many political candidates lack.  I think this is a case where Trump had unique characteristics as a candidate that allowed him to pursue a different type of strategy, said Tony Corrado, a professor of government at Colby College in Maine.  In total, Trump raised at least $270 million since launching his campaign in June 2015, a little more than a third of the money that Obamas re-election campaign spent in 2012, according to the most recent filings with the Federal Elections Commission.  With vote counting wrapping up in the early hours of Wednesday, Trump had won some 59 million votes nationwide in the general election. That amounts to less than $5 per vote for the $270 million he spent.     According to data analytics firm mediaQuant, Trump garnered about $5 billion worth of free media coverage during the election campaign, more than twice the amount earned by Clinton, a lifelong politician who served as secretary of state, senator, and first lady at different times in her career. mediaQuant adds up all the unpaid coverage the candidates earn in newspapers, magazines and social media and then compares the sum to what a comparable amount of coverage, with the same kind of reach, would have cost in advertising.  Trump has also frequently dominated news cycles with provocative rhetoric that breaks taboos, including unabashed insults targeting women he dislikes over Twitter, or unusual policy proscriptions like his call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country to prevent domestic attacks, or to force Mexico to pay for a multi-billion dollar border wall to keep out immigrants. Trump made his self-funding a selling point early in his campaign as he fended off 16 Republican rivals for the party nomination, arguing that by eschewing big donors he was not beholden to special interests.  But once he secured the nomination, Trump changed course and began fundraising in earnest, replicating the small dollar fundraising juggernaut of another insurgent candidate, Democrat Bernie Sanders, along the way.     Clinton raised at least $521 million, according to filings.  The former secretary of state stuck to the more traditional campaigning model of launching expensive television ads and funding hundreds of staffers who fanned across the country to work to increase voter turnout on Election Day.  She spent more than $237 million on television ads and more than $42 million on hundreds of staffers.  She also benefited from spending by the Super PACs supporting her candidacy, which are allowed to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money but cannot coordinate directly with the campaign. More than a dozen people, including hedge fund magnate Donald Sussman and global financier George Soros,wrote multi-million checks to Priorities USA, the primary PAC supporting her campaign, according to filings.  Michael Traugott, a political science professor at the University of Michigan, said the traditional U.S. model for picking presidents might seem odd to people in other nations, where campaigns are shorter and require less cash.  The system is clearly broken, Traugott said. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
U.N. chief hopes Trump will strengthen international cooperation,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Wednesday he hopes the administration of Donald Trump will strengthen the bonds of international cooperation and described Hillary Clinton as a powerful symbol of womens empowerment.  In the aftermath of a hard-fought and often divisive campaign, it is worth recalling and reaffirming that the unity in diversity of the United States is one of the countrys greatest strengths. I encourage all Americans to stay true to that spirit, Ban said after Trumps presidential election victory.  People everywhere look to the United States to use its remarkable power to help lift humanity up and to work for the common good, Ban told reporters. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
Rhetoric or reality? Arabs struggle to decode Trump's Mideast rhetoric,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The future leader of the Middle Easts top foreign ally is, in the words of a Saudi prince, an anti-Muslim disgrace, openly disdainful of Arab security partnerships, who believes Saudi Arabia would cease to exist for long without the United States. Donald Trumps presidential election victory means he is the man Washingtons Arab allies must deal with after his January inauguration, as they seek U.S. help to end wars from Syria to Mosul, manage humanitarian crises and provide jobs for their populations at a time of low oil prices. Trumps campaign tirades against Muslim migrants - the target of Prince Alwaleed bin Talals comments on Twitter - and against Arab allies who dont pay for U.S. support suggest the relationship could be delicate. How far Trump the president will differ from Trump the polarizing election candidate is not clear. Brief, congratulatory messages flowed quickly from Arab allies, including one from Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz, who wished Trump success in achieving security and stability in the Middle East and the wider world. But underneath the protocol, for many Arab rulers and royals Trumps victory is a source of anxiety.They now face a new America led by Trump who, they fear, could upend a regional order that has prevailed for decades. Some ordinary Arabs like Trumps no-nonsense style, and praise what they see as his capacity for tough leadership. A strong leader ... that is what is needed here in the Middle East and all across the world, said Ali al-Muhannadi, 57, a Qatari owner of an electrical company, filling his car up at a petrol station in Doha on Wednesday. Muhannadi saw Trump as a useful ally in confronting the jihadist threat, saying he is very frank and not like a politician. Islamist radicals are bad for the West and for us too. But privately there are concerns about a lack of clarity in Trumps policies for the worlds most combustible region as it struggles to break free from war while trying to safeguard the free flow of its oil exports. In particular there are worries that Trumps hostile rhetoric towards Muslim migrants will play into the hands of Islamic State and al Qaeda, which are eager to recruit disaffected young Arabs to wage war on the regional governments they despise as stooges of Washington. Gulf Arab leaders want a U.S. president who understands their concerns after eight years of what they regard as diffidence under President Barack Obama, someone who did not provide the kind of personal contact they value. In particular they want help to push back against Iran, their main rival. But they fear Trumps public praise for Vladimir Putin will encourage Russia to expand its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, an ally of Iran and an enemy of most Gulf Arab states. Apart from a commitment to Israels security, a constant in U.S. foreign policy, and an isolationist tone to his comments, much in Trumps statements about the region remains vague and poorly thought out, diplomats and analysts say. Opinion is divided about whether Trumps remarks on the campaign trail will be enacted when in office. Among these is his comment that he would consider halting U.S. purchases of Saudi oil unless Riyadh provides troops to fight Islamic State. Faisal Al Yafai, a commentator at The National newspaper, said many people thought Trump had used his extravagant comments to win votes and once in office he would mellow. I am unconvinced. I think he actually believes his rhetoric. Its quite worrying that he doesnt seem to understand how global politics works, he said. For example you dont go around saying if our allies were threatened we wouldnt intervene, why cant they build their own nuclear weapons?  That sort of stuff doesnt help confidence. That collapse of confidence between the U.S. and its allies has a knock-on impact on the economies and in the decisions those countries take on a political level. Yafai, whose newspaper is based in the United Arab Emirates, noted Iraqis were putting their lives on the line to regain  Mosul, Islamic States main stronghold in the country. That is not just a war for the region, it is a war for the world, he said. Others are more sanguine. A senior Turkish official predicted continued strong relations with the United States and argued that comments in an election period always have a harder and more hawkish tone than is necessary. But they remain peculiar to the election period. Prince Sultan bin Khaled al Faisal, a former Saudi special forces officer and now senior fellow at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh, said that in U.S. elections what they say and what they do are two totally different things.  Foreign policy is not made by one man, he said. But its difficult to pinpoint what his policy actually is. Trumps remarks have been combative, and eye-catching. He has said the United States should be reimbursed by the countries it provides protection for. Without America, Saudi Arabia wouldnt exist for very long, Trump told the New York Times in March. Trumps win drew a cautious welcome in Syria, which has entered its fifth year of war between rebels and Assads forces. In Damascus, Syrian member of parliament Sherif Shehada said U.S. policy could shift Assads way. We must be optimistic, but cautiously optimistic, Shehada told Reuters by telephone. Trumps statements on Syria, and his more open-minded stance towards Assads ally Russia, have fueled rebel concern about the policy he may adopt on the conflict, in which the Russian air force has been bombing insurgents.  But beyond all that, many officials and observers see another ominous consequence. Trumps win has not only delighted Western right-wingers but also jihadistswho told supporters the election had revealed the true position of the United States towards Muslims. The masks have slipped, one supporter said on Islamic State websites. (Trumps) moronic declarations alone serve us even if his decisions will be under the supervision of the Senate..., wrote another.

Putin says will try to repair ties with U.S.A. under Trump,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia is ready to do its part to fully restore ties with Washington following the election of businessman Donald Trump as the next U.S. President, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday. Trump stunned the world by defeating heavily favored rival Hillary Clinton in Tuesdays presidential election, ending eight years of Democratic rule and sending the United States on a new, uncertain path. Among those uncertainties will be the Trump administrations future relations with Russia. Ties between Washington and Moscow have become increasingly strained over the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, and allegations of Russian cyber attacks featured in the U.S. election campaign. We heard the campaign statements of the future U.S. presidential candidate about the restoration of relations between Russia and the United States, Putin said on Wednesday at a ceremony to receive credentials from new foreign ambassadors. It is not an easy path, but we are ready to do our part and do everything to return Russian and American relations to a stable path of development, he added. This would be good for both the Russian and American people and have a positive impact on the climate of world affairs. Trump is widely viewed as friendly to the Kremlin and Putin has said previously his future counterpart is a talented and colorful character. The Kremlin said earlier on Wednesday Russia hoped coordination with the United States over the war in Syria, where the two countries back opposing sides, would improve under the new U.S. president.

Backs against the wall: Trump victory casts pall over Mexico,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico was pitched into deep uncertainty by Donald Trumps U.S. election victory on Tuesday after a bitterly divisive campaign, raising the prospect of major clashes over trade, immigration and security. The peso currency suffered its biggest fall in 22 years on fears Trump will stick to a campaign pledge to rewrite or dump a free trade treaty he says is loaded in Mexicos favor. Investors worry a trade fight could tip Mexicos economy into recession. The Republican candidate has threatened to deport millions of undocumented Mexican migrants, many of whom he described as rapists and drug runners, and to keep others out by building a massive border wall he says Mexico will pay for. Watching in homes and bars around the country as the New York real estate tycoon extended his lead over Democrat Hillary Clinton in one U.S. state after another, many Mexicans were gripped by disbelief and fear. We have to start saving for that wall, said Rafael Garnica, a 29-year-old Mexico City technology entrepreneur. Its not just Trump that frightens me, its that he represents a huge amount of people in the United States. On Twitter, some Mexicans urged their government to seek dialogue with Trump, while others said they feared a rupture of ties with the United States. Trumps victory is the antithesis of the fall of the Berlin Wall, tweeted Fernando Belaunzaran, a politician for the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution.  Trumps victory coincided with the anniversary of the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall. Trump has proposed blocking billions of dollars in remittances sent home by Mexicans working in the United States to make Mexico pay for his border wall. Pena Nieto, who likened Trumps rhetoric to that of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, has dismissed the idea out of hand and his foreign minister reiterated on Wednesday the country had no intention of paying. On the campaign trail, Trump relentlessly attacked the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between Mexico, Canada and the United States as the worst deal ever, vowing to scrap it if he cannot renegotiate it. NAFTA has been a cornerstone of Mexican economic policy since it took effect in 1994. Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said in a news conference on Wednesday that uncertainty and volatility had increased since Trumps win, but that there was no immediate impact on trade rules between the two countries. Some business leaders say the U.S and Mexican economies are now so closely integrated it is impossible to take steps against one without damaging the other. We will be facing months of volatility and uncertainty while the new government in Washington takes office and we see whether Mr. Trump is able to make good on his unfortunate campaign promises and rhetoric, said Andres Rozental, a former Mexican deputy foreign minister. Mexican officials hope to diversify export markets to try to reduce the countrys dependence on U.S. consumers, and Pena Nieto has said he would work with the winner of the election. He was pilloried at home for inviting Trump to Mexico in late August in an effort to create some leverage for his government in case the businessman won. Trump softened his tone on the brief stopover he made to meet Pena Nieto, telling a news conference it was important to keep manufacturing in North America and describing Mexican-Americans as spectacular, hard-working people. But within hours of his departure, he and Pena Nieto got into a Twitter feud over who would pay for the wall. After Trumps victory, Pena Nieto said on Twitter he was ready to work with him, calling the neighboring countries friends who should continue to work together for the competitiveness and development of North America. Under NAFTA, four out of every five dollars made by Mexican exporters has come from the United States, and bilateral trade is now worth about half a trillion dollars annually. Trump has threatened to levy tariffs of up to 35 percent on Mexican-made goods, sparking fears of a massive hit to trade, especially in Mexicos northern border regions. The U.S. president has the power to rescind NAFTA but policymakers on both sides of the border consulted by Reuters said Trump would come under heavy pressure from Congress and business leaders not to wreck trade. Some Mexicans whose livelihoods are linked to the trade ties between the two countries also expressed hope that Trumps bark would be worse than his bite. Well have to see, because theres no certainty that hes going to do everything that his campaign has been saying, said Jonathan Bolaos, night receptionist at the Hotel Fiesta Inn, based in an industrial park in the border city of Nogales. Its true he was very aggressive, very tough, but sometimes people have to act that way to reach positions requiring charisma. Still, Mexican officials say Trumps hard line on trade blurs with his radical stance on immigration. Trumps wall isnt just a message to Mexico about migrants. Its about imports too, said a senior Mexican government security official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Friction over trade could put bilateral cooperation over security, the fight against drug trafficking and curbing illegal migration under strain, which U.S. and Mexican officials say has improved steadily under Pena Nieto and President Barack Obama. Mexicos ambassador to Washington, Carlos Sada, said at an event in Los Angeles last month that Trump had dealt a blow to the United States image south of the border and stirred up historic resentment. Alongside him, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Roberta Jacobson, joked about how Trumps campaign had also made life difficult for U.S. diplomats south of the border. I thought about just hiding until November 9th, she said.    The overwhelming, universal reaction to the Trump visit itself, and even to a lot in the election campaign, has been What the ... fff ... you know? But the more concerning response, the much deeper response has been: Were afraid it wont go back to normal after this. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1

As part of his campaign, Trump vowed that he would build a massive border wall and make Mexico pay for it. Ruiz Massieu said that the government had maintained communication with Trumps campaign team ever since his visit to Mexico in August. There has been a fluid, daily communication with different members of the campaign, she said. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
"Czech president very happy with Trump win, says shares his views","PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech President Milos Zeman declared on Wednesday he was very happy with Donald Trumps election victory, saying he cut through political correctness and addressed key issues like migration. Zeman, who is head of the NATO and European Union member state but does not steer day-to-day policies, endorsed Trump in September. I would like to cordially congratulate Donald Trump. I had, as one of few European politicians, declared public support for this candidate... because I agree with his opinions on migration as well as the fight against Islamic terrorism, Zeman told reporters in a rare press briefing at the Prague Castle. Zemans reaction chimed with Hungarian leader Viktor Orban but contrasted with shock in many European capitals. Unlike the current Czech center-left administration, Zeman shares Trumps warm relations toward Russian leader Vladimir Putin and opposition to liberal and academic elites. I appreciate Donald Trumps public demeanor, he speaks clearly, sometimes roughly, but understandably, and avoids what is sometimes called political correctness, Zeman said. He said the election showed American voters resistance to manipulation by the media, another frequent target of both Trump and Zeman. The Czech president said he had sent congratulations to Trump and invited him to visit the Czech Republic, the birthplace of Trumps ex-wife Ivana. Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said Trump had won on aggressive populism but added he believed the United States would remain a reliable partner and ally.

U.S. voters deliver mixed results on gun control measures,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Voters rendered a split decision on gun control measures in the election, approving universal background checks for private firearms sales in Nevada while narrowly rejecting them in Maine. Gun safety advocates had poured millions of dollars into backing the initiatives in an effort to combat the political might of the gun lobbys National Rifle Association. The measure was defeated in Maine by 51.0 percent of votes to 48.9 percent, or about 12,700 ballots, the Bangor Daily News reported. Nevada voters approved a similar proposal by 50.5 percent to 49.6 percent, state election officials said. Both ballot initiatives were backed by Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun control group founded by billionaire former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and polls had suggested the measures would pass.  The votes were seen as a crucial test of the gun safety campaigns decision to adopt a state-by-state strategy after efforts to pass legislation failed in Congress. Gun control supporters won victories in two other states. Washington state voters easily approved a measure giving judges the power to keep dangerous individuals, such as accused domestic abusers, from possessing guns. In California, residents backed a referendum that bans large-capacity ammunition magazines and requires some people to undergo background checks in order to buy ammunition. The U.S. Constitutions Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms, and gun rights advocates fiercely contest any attempt to restrict it. Opponents had said the background check laws were not clear and would do nothing to stop criminals. We know today that the place where criminals are getting guns, the black market, they arent subjecting themselves to background checks, said Ryan Hamilton, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association-backed opposition in Nevada, before Election Day. It doesnt target criminal behavior, it targets law-abiding behavior. Proponents, however, said background checks would save lives. Jennifer Crowe, a spokeswoman for the pro-initiative campaign in Nevada, previously told Reuters nearly one in 11 people in that state who purchased guns online would have failed a background check. Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun control group founded by billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, spent tens of millions of dollars in Washington state, Nevada and Maine, while the National Rifle Association focused much of its spending on supporting Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

"From Jakarta to Lagos, many Muslims voice dismay at Trump win","JAKARTA/ISLAMABAD/CAIRO (Reuters) - Many Muslims around the world expressed dismay on Wednesday at Donald Trumps election as U.S. president, saying they feared it might raise tensions between the West and Islam and contribute to radicalization. While Egypts president made an early congratulatory call to Trump, ordinary Muslims were worried that his victory would be a propaganda gift to jihadist groups. Others were apprehensive that the president-elect will implement campaign pledges to clamp down on Muslims entering the United States. Trump has espoused highly inflammatory rhetoric against Muslims. Voters there will expect him to fulfill his promises. That makes me worry about the impact on Muslims in the U.S. and in the rest of the world, said Yenny Wahid, a prominent mainstream Muslim figure in Indonesia.      The worlds 1.6 billion Muslims follow a multitude of sects and schools of thought, constitute a majority of the population in countries as varied as Indonesia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Senegal and Albania, and hold a vast array of political views. Yet Trumps previous comments about Muslims, that those from abroad should be barred entry or intensely scrutinized beforehand, and the presence of vocal anti-Islam activists among his supporters, has alarmed many. During a bitter election campaign, Trump also attacked his opponents for what he characterized as their denial about the threat posed by militant Islam, which he said was coming to our shores, adding that he would quickly form a commission on it. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was the first world leader to congratulate Trump on the phone, Sisis office said. Many other Egyptians also welcomed his victory, saying his opponent Hillary Clintons record in office had won her few friends in the most populous Arab country. Clinton, Secretary of State during the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, is unpopular with many Egyptians. Many of those who backed the revolt saw her as a long-standing supporter of Hosni Mubarak, the autocrat they toppled from power. But elsewhere, other Muslims saw Trump as a hostile figure. Whatever happens to America affects everybody and with all these promises of doom by Trump to the blacks, to the Muslims, the minority, so its not something were happy about, said Ganiu Olukanga, a Muslim resident of the Nigerian capital Lagos.              Some Muslims, including Wahid, said they feared his election as president might encourage a view that the United States held enmity for Muslims and that this would hinder efforts in Islam to counter radicalization.  Trumps victory will be an enormous gift to a failing jihadist movement, that will have now have a renewed rallying cry, said Ammar Rashid, an academic and member of Pakistans Awami Workers Party on Twitter.  If jihadi ideology has a source of sustenance, it is the image of the US as the evil anti-Muslim crusader. They will milk Trumps win dry, he added.  In jihadist social media forums, militants said Trumps election had merely revealed the true position of the United States toward Muslims. The masks have slipped, one wrote.  But some other Muslims were more hopeful, including Umer Daudzai, former Afghan minister of interior, citing the record of Ronald Reagan who was U.S. president from 1981-89. Ronald Reagan ended the Cold War. I hope Donald Trump will end all wars and become hero of peace in the world, he told Reuters.  Among some officials, there were also expressions of concern but the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the body that represents Muslim states, issued no statement early on Wednesday.  In Indonesia, the most populous Muslim nation, an official from the faiths top clerical body there said Trumps election could create new tension between the United States and the Islamic world.   Trump had made negative, cynical comments about Muslims in the past, Din Syamsuddin, a senior official at the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), told reporters in Jakarta. He had forgotten that many Americans are immigrants.     Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally that is both birthplace of Islam and home to its holiest places, issued a statement that it had congratulated Trump on his election win without making further comment.  However, Awad al-Qirni, one of its most popular clerics with a Twitter following of two million, said in a social media post after the election - but without referring to Trump directly - that America declines into collapse and that its internal crisis will grow severely.  In Pakistan, Sherry Rehman, a senator and former ambassador to Washington, said Trumps proposal last year to bar Muslims from entering the U.S. had disturbed many.  Pakistan obviously cannot rule out engaging with whomever America elects but his anti-Muslim rhetoric may cast a shadow on relations in times of uncertainty, he told Reuters on Wednesday.  And in Bangladesh, a government official who asked not to be named said: I cant think what awaits us. Donald Trump was talking about fighting against Muslims. Are we going to see more wars? Among private citizens in Dhaka, some said they hoped the pressure of office would temper Trumps views.  It is just unbelievable and I am a bit tense. I hope there will be a difference between Donald Trump and President Donald Trump. President Trump will be more mature than individual Trump, Asif Iqbal, a private sector employee, said.

California voters embrace recreational marijuana,"SACRAMENTO, Calif./LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A ballot measure to make recreational marijuana legal for adults was approved in California, opening the most populous U.S. state to a burgeoning commercial cannabis market in a major victory for supporters of liberalized drug laws. Proposition 64 passed easily as statewide returns from the election showed nearly 56 percent of voters favoring the measure and 44 percent opposed, according to results on Wednesday morning reported from more than 90 percent of precincts. California was by far the largest of five states with ballot measures seeking to legalize the use of marijuana for the sheer pleasure of its intoxicating effects, and approval there extends legalization to the entire U.S. Pacific Coast. Recreational marijuana was first approved in 2012 by Washington state and Colorado, and later by voters in Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia. Victory also was declared on Tuesday by supporters of a similar measure in Massachusetts, giving legalized recreational pot its first toehold in New England.  Nevada voters also backed legalization for recreational purposes, but neighboring Arizona rejected a similar proposal. In the fifth state, Maine, the result was too close to call on Wednesday morning. The Marijuana Policy Project, the nations leading organization supporting liberalization of cannabis laws, likewise projected passage of measures permitting medical use of marijuana in Florida, Arkansas, North Dakota and Montana. Before Tuesday, 25 states had already legalized cannabis in some way, whether for medical or recreational uses, or both. [here] Approval in California alone, home to 39 million people, means that almost a fifth of all Americans live in states where recreational marijuana is legal, according to U.S. Census figures.  California was the first U.S. state to legalize medical marijuana, doing so in 1996.  The new measure, spearheaded by a coalition of supporters that included Democratic Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom and billionaire high-tech entrepreneur Sean Parker, allows adults to possess and use up to an ounce of pot for private, recreational use. It also permits personal cultivation of as many as six cannabis plants.  Moreover, it would establish a system to license, regulate and tax sales of marijuana, while allowing city governments to exercise local control over commercial distribution within their borders. California voters defeated a similar initiative in 2010, but public opinion polls show attitudes have since shifted. Opponents of liberalized marijuana laws have argued that such measures carry major public safety risks and would make pot more accessible to youngsters. Experts say the latest initiatives include more sophisticated regulatory mechanisms aimed at keeping cannabis away from children and banning the involvement of criminal gangs and drug cartels. They also point to the potential for hundreds of millions in additional state tax revenue from pot sales and billions in economic activity.  Investors new to the sector said they are eager for a piece of a recreational marijuana market that by some estimates will reach $50 billion over the next decade. Its changed in the minds of these voters from being like cocaine to being like beer, said University of Southern California political scientist John Matsusaka. Civil rights groups have also embraced legalization, arguing that current marijuana laws have led to a disproportionate number of minorities being incarcerated for minor drug offenses.

"Republicans gain governorships, but North Carolina up in the air","WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - Republicans extended their majority of U.S. governorships on Tuesday as 12 states voted for chief executives, though the high-profile race in North Carolina was too close to call and the outcome may not be known until next week. Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper declared victory after gaining a razor-thin lead over incumbent Republican Governor Pat McCrory, who has been dogged by the backlash against a law he signed that restricts bathroom rights for transgender people and limits non-discrimination protections for gays and lesbians.  But McCrory told supporters early on Wednesday that the process of tallying an unknown number of provisional ballots could take until Nov. 18. The election is not over in North Carolina, McCrory said. About 4,400 votes separated the candidates with all precincts reporting, according to unofficial election results from the state. The state extended voting times in eight Durham County precincts after problems with electronic voting rolls there earlier in the day. The county then uploaded about 90,000 early voting results late Tuesday, prompting concerns among Republicans as Cooper overtook McCrory in the ballot count. Elsewhere in the country, Republicans picked up seats in Missouri and Vermont in races that had been considered toss-ups. A winner had not been declared as of early Wednesday in the competitive race in New Hampshire. The outcomes of votes across the country were not expected, however, to dramatically alter the 31-18 advantage Republicans had over Democrats in the states executive offices going into Election Day. Alaska has an independent governor.  Republican Lieutenant Governor Phil Scott clinched his victory in Vermont over Democrat Sue Minter, a former state transportation secretary, despite the state voting overwhelmingly for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential race.  In West Virginia, where Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won by a landslide, billionaire businessman Jim Justice held on to the governors seat for Democrats by beating Republican state Senate President Bill Cole. Republicans successfully defended the governorship in Indiana for a fourth straight term. Lieutenant Governor Eric Holcomb, who had trailed slightly in polls, won the race left open after Trump tapped Governor Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate. Pence offered his congratulations to Holcomb on Twitter, saying the governor-elect was the leader who will keep our state moving forward. Republicans also celebrated in Kentucky, where they gained a majority in the state House of Representatives, the last Democratic-held chamber in the South. The takeover ended 95 years of a Democratic majority in that chamber. ",politicsNews,"November 8, 2016 ",1

Dutch rightist Wilders expects Trump boost for Europe's populists,"THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Dutch far-right politician Geert Wilders said Donald Trumps victory in the U.S. presidential election was a sign that the West was living through a patriotic spring that would boost support for populist parties in Europe like his own. Wilders, whose anti-immigration, anti-Muslim Freedom Party tops polls ahead of next years parliamentary elections, said mainstream politicians had lost the trust of voters in the West by ignoring the issues they cared most about. Trump winning proved to me that people are fed up with politically correct politicians who are concerned and involved with issues that regard themselves but not those that are important to the public, he said.

"China's Xi tells Trump two countries must promote non-conflict, cooperation","BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping congratulated Donald Trump on winning the U.S. presidency, state TV reported on Wednesday, telling him the two biggest economies in the world shared responsibility for promoting global development and prosperity. I place great importance on the China-U.S. relationship, and look forward to working with you to uphold the principles of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, Xi told Trump in a message. State TV did not specify how the message was delivered. The stable and healthy long-term development of Sino-U.S. relations was in the fundamental interest of the Chinese and American peoples, he said. Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, stunned the world on Tuesday by defeating heavily favored rival Hillary Clinton, sending stocks and the U.S. dollar tumbling. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to take on China and tax Chinese imports to stop currency devaluation.

Trump election puts Iran nuclear deal on shaky ground,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps election as president raises the prospect the United States will pull out of the nuclear pact it signed last year with Iran, alienating Washington from its allies and potentially freeing Iran to act on its ambitions. Outgoing President Barack Obamas administration touted the deal, a legacy foreign policy achievement, as a way to suspend Tehrans suspected drive to develop atomic weapons. In return Obama, a Democrat, agreed to a lifting of most sanctions. The deal, harshly opposed by Republicans in Congress, was reached as a political commitment rather than a treaty ratified by lawmakers, making it vulnerable to a new U.S. president, such as Trump, who might disagree with its terms. A Republican, Trump ran for the White House opposing the deal but contradictory statements made it unclear how he would act. In an upset over Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump won on Tuesday and will succeed Obama on Jan. 20. A businessman-turned-politician who has never held public office, Trump called the nuclear pact a disaster and the worst deal ever negotiated during his campaign and said it could lead to a nuclear holocaust.  In a speech to the pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC in March, Trump declared that his Number-One priority would be to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran.   He said he would have negotiated a better deal, with longer restrictions, but somewhat paradoxically, he criticized remaining U.S. sanctions that prevent American companies from dealing with Iran. By contrast, he has conceded it would be hard to destroy a deal enshrined in a United Nations resolution. In August 2015, he said he would not rip up the nuclear deal, but that he would police that contract so tough they dont have a chance. Iran denies ever having considered developing atomic weapons. But experts said any U.S. violation of the deal would allow Iran also to pull back from its commitments to curb nuclear development.  Those commitments include reducing the number of its centrifuges by two-thirds, capping its level of uranium enrichment well below the level needed for bomb-grade material, reducing its enriched uranium stockpile from around 10,000 kg to 300 kg for 15 years, and submitting to international inspections to verify its compliance. Say goodbye to the Iran deal, said Richard Nephew, a former U.S. negotiator with Iran now at Columbia University. There is very little likelihood that it stays, either because of a deliberate decision to tear it up by Trump, or steps that the U.S. takes which prompt an Iranian walk back. The spokesman of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Behrouz Kamalvandi, was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency: Iran is prepared for any change, adding that Iran would try to stand by the deal. The nuclear deal was divisive in Iran, with hardliners opposed to better relations with the West arguing that pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani was giving up too much of the countrys nuclear infrastructure for too little relief. Rouhani said on Wednesday the U.S. election results would have no effect on Tehrans policies, state news agency IRNA quoted him as saying. [nL8N1DA46H] Some of Washingtons closest Middle East allies have been skeptical of the nuclear deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been outright hostile. Gulf leaders say the deal has emboldened Irans pursuit of regional hegemony in part through support for proxy groups fueling regional conflicts. Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, whose power supersedes that of Rouhani, regularly criticizes the United States and says it should not be trusted, but ultimately assented to the terms of the deal, known by its acronym JCPOA. The big winner in the aftermath of a Trump victory is Irans Supreme Leader, said Suzanne Maloney, a foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution. He will have the most cartoonish American enemy, he will exult in the (hopefully brief) crash of the American economy, and he will be able to walk away from Irans obligations under the JCPOA while pinning the responsibility on Washington. Further complicating any Trump effort to renegotiate the deal is that it is a multilateral agreement involving U.S. allies in Europe as well as fellow world powers Russia and China. European and Asian firms have been returning to Iran and making major investments there, meaning the United States would likely be alone in pulling out of the deal, possibly isolating it from its partners. On Wednesday, the head of gas, renewables and power for French oil and gas company Total TOTF.PA in Iran said Trumps election would have no impact on investments [nP6N1CW004]. Khamenei has already promised to set fire to the nuclear deal if the West violates it. Iran has repeatedly complained it has not received benefits promised. Though European companies have been eager to explore business prospects in Iran, few deals have been enacted in part because European banks have been reluctant to finance deals involving Iran. As to whether he can negotiate a better deal, it takes two (or seven) sides to agree to begin that process, something I rate as highly unlikely, said Zachary Goldman, executive director of the Center on Law and Security at New York University and a former U.S. Treasury official. And if we walk away from the deal I think we will be in the worst of all worlds - Iran will feel freed from its commitments and we may be blamed for the deal falling apart.

"For China, Trump win creates uncertainty, opportunity","BEIJING (Reuters) - Donald Trumps upset election victory cracks open pressing strategic and economic questions in U.S.-China ties, and has likely surprised and worried Chinese leaders, who prize stability in relations between the two powers. Trump had lambasted China throughout the campaign, drumming up headlines with his pledges to slap 45 percent tariffs on imported Chinese goods and label the country a currency manipulator his first day in office. He has also questioned U.S. security commitments to allies and undercut long-held bipartisan U.S. foreign policy norms, such as suggesting that Japan develop nuclear weapons, all stances that if he follows through on could upset the regional security balance in Asia. That unpredictability is not an ideal election outcome for Chinas stability-obsessed Communist Party, especially as it seeks smooth U.S. relations at a time of daunting reform challenges at home, a slowing economy, and a leadership reshuffle of its own that will put a new party elite around President Xi Jinping in late 2017. Beijing tends to prefer incumbent party successors with consistent policy lines. Trumps lack of a governance track record and his unorthodox take on long-held Republican priorities could prove a headache for Chinese officials. Jia Qingguo, the dean of the School of International Relations at Chinas elite Peking University and a government advisor, called Trump a symbol of uncertainty. China hopes the United States future policy would be more certain because in this way, we can prepare and deal with it, Jia said. DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD Certainly, a Trump White House presents China with a range of new opportunities. Decades of Hillary Clintons criticism of Chinas human rights record and her insistence on U.S. interests in the South China Sea have made her a well-known, and not well-liked figure among Beijings ruling elite. Chinese experts say some in Beijing believe Trump will prove a pragmatic businessman, willing to deal with China. Any type of protectionist policy pursued will be a double-edged sword, said Ruan Zongze, a former Chinese diplomat now with the China Institute of International Studies, a think-tank affiliated with the Foreign Ministry. I think he will be very careful about this, Moreover, Trumps criticism of U.S. allies, including Japan, for free-riding on U.S. security guarantees, has offered China the tantalizing prospect of an American retrenchment from Asia. From a long-term perspective, this gives China more space to prove itself and it takes off some of the pressure on China, said Wang Yiwei, Director of the Institute of International Affairs at Chinas Renmin University. But a U.S. pullback in the region would raise other questions for Beijing, such as the uncomfortable prospect of a potential Japanese military expansion. While Trump has vowed to build-up the U.S. military, in particular the Navy, he has said little publicly about his approach to Beijings increasingly assertive role in the South China Sea.  Trumps foreign policy approach does seem to be somewhat inchoate andtherefore much will depend on who he appoints and who is willing to serve, said Dean Cheng, a China expert at the Heritage Foundation in Washington. The U.S. and Chinese business community alike has been unsettled at the prospect of a Trump presidency. Gloria Liu, partner at law firm DLA Piper, which specializes in Chinese mergers and acquisitions, said: The US has been the No. 1 destination for outbound Chinese investments. Its hard to see Chinese firms making the US their first choice. At a minimum, there will be a period of wait and see. U.S. business groups have grown more pessimistic about Chinese restrictions on market barriers and state subsidized efforts to replace foreign technology with home-grown products.  But they also worry that Trumps China tariff pledges will undermine the economic interdependence that helps the two countries weather serious security differences. Executives are holding their breath. Everybody is going to be asking who is the real Donald Trump and how much of this campaign rhetoric is going to find itself into reality, said Randal Phillips, who heads Mintz Groups office in Beijing. A Beijing-based state energy executive involved in overseas investment said the market was very worried by Trumps victory and selling for risk aversion. Trump increases the unpredictability in U.S. policies over regulatory approvals, the likelihood of tighter scrutiny on Chinese investment ... and also over oil and gas exports, said the executive, who asked not to be named.  James Zimmerman, the head of the American Chamber of Commerce in China and a prominent Clinton backer, said talking tough is a lot easier than thinking tough and making tough decisions, which is what presidents actually have to do. Isolating or penalizing China will not serve Americas interests, he said in a statement. Chinese President Xi Jinping congratulated Donald Trump on winning the U.S. presidency, state TV reported on Wednesday, telling him the two biggest economies in the world shared responsibility for promoting global development and prosperity. I place great importance on the China-U.S. relationship, and look forward to working with you to uphold the principles of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, Xi told Trump by phone.

Trump presidency to create high anxiety among Asian allies,"TOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trumps victory in the U.S. presidential election will deepen Asian allies anxiety about Washingtons  commitment to post-war security arrangements in the face of a rising China and volatile North Korea, and could bolster calls from conservatives in Tokyo for a more robust defense policy. Trumps America First rhetoric and calls for allies to pay more of the cost for U.S. troops in the region or face their possible withdrawal have worried officials in some Asian capitals. So has his opposition to a 12-nation pan-Pacific trade pact that was a linchpin of Washingtons pivot to the region. We should expect dramatic changes in the security environment, said South Koreas ruling Saenuri Party floor leader Chung Jin-suk in parliament on Wednesday. But he added: In any case, there should not be any wavering in the Korea-U.S. military alliance, which has been the foundation of prosperity of this country.  A Japanese government official, speaking before Trump clinched the election, urged the new president to send a reassuring message. The new president-elect should as soon as possible issue a statement reassuring the rest of the world thatthe strong commitment of the United States to its allies ... remains strong and reliable, said the official, who declined to be identified. We are certainly concerned about the comments (Trump) has made to date about the alliance and the U.S. role in the Pacific, particularly Japan, the Japanese official said, although he added Trumps policies might not match his rhetoric. Trump has made several comments that disturbed Washingtons Asian allies, from insisting they must foot more of the two-way defense bill to suggesting it might be alright for Tokyo and Seoul develop nuclear arms capability. In an article criticizing U.S. President Barack Obamas pivot to Asia as talking loudly but carrying a small stick two Trump advisors said he would beef up the U.S. Navy while asserting it was only fair that Seoul and Tokyo pay more for defense.  There is no question of Trumps commitment to Americas Asian alliances as bedrocks of stability in the region, wrote  University of California professor Peter Navarro and Alexander Gray, a former advisor to U.S. politician Randy Forbes, in the article, which appeared in the Nov. 7 edition of Foreign Policy. The article also criticized the Obama administration for failing to halt Chinas aggressive maritime activities in the East and South China Seas, where Beijing has territorial rows with several countries in the region. Trump has called for more ships for the U.S. Navy. The mere initiation of the Trump naval program will reassure our allies that the United States remains committed in the long term to its traditional role as guarantor of the liberal order in Asia, the authors said.    Trumps approach to the North Asia security alliances could spark calls in Japan for a more independent security stance, although serious talk of acquiring nuclear weapons is unlikely to emerge in the only nation to suffer atomic bombings.  I think they will have more legitimacy, said a Japanese diplomat, referring to those seeking a more robust security stance. But the Japanese public is reluctant to go in that direction and we dont have the capacity in terms of budget or (military) personnel. Asian allies who joined the 12-nation Tran-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, a linchpin of Obamas Asia pivot, now fear the pact is dead, given Trumps harsh opposition. That has implications not only for trade, but security, since Washington and Tokyo had seen the TPP as way of creating a new regional rule-based architecture to counter China. TPP was not just a trade deal, it was the United States and Japan, together ... these countries with shared values would create an advanced regional order with not just economic, but diplomatic and security implications, said Toshihiro Nakayama, a professor at Keio University in Tokyo. It was a symbol of America being committed to the region. Singapore-based security expert Tim Huxley warned of a period of potentially destabilizing uncertainty ahead as the region waits for clearer strategic signs of precisely what a Trump presidency would mean for Asia. Unless Trump speaks reassuringly and soothingly about the continued U.S. presence and commitment to the region, I wont be surprised to see long-held doubts awoken in the minds of many Asian leaders about the durability of the traditional U.S. role, he said.  Policy-makers expect it will take considerable time for Trump to work out personnel appointments and get down to policy formation. Divisive U.S. politics could also slow things down. That could mean a worrisome vacuum, but also suggests no quick, dramatic changes are in store. It will take about half a year for Mr. Trump to firm up his foreign policies. He only has a transition team of about 200 people and his first focus will be domestic policy, said Masashi Adachi, head of the Japanese ruling Liberal Democratic Partys foreign policy panel. I dont think there will be a big change in his stance toward Japan. He has said the Japan-U.S. alliance is important. What he is talking about is details like increasing what Japan pays for U.S. troops in Japan, Adachi added. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1

How Trump crushed naysayers with a coalition of the forgotten,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump was right. Countless others were wrong. The pundits and pollsters who said the former reality TV star could not win the U.S. presidency, the Republicans who shunned him, the business leaders who denounced him and the Democrats who dismissed him failed to fully understand the depth of his support.  In a stunning victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump stuck to a plan that worked to perfection in the Republican primary, a campaign built around his blunt-talking celebrity persona, his command of social media, and his anti-establishment message of change. Ours was not a campaign, but an incredible and great movement, Trump said in his victory speech on Wednesday.  It was a movement driven by discontent. The Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll found that most Americans who came to the polls were clearly angry with the direction of the country. Six out of 10 people said they felt the country is on the wrong track. Some 58 percent said more and more I dont identify with what America has become and 75 percent said America needs a strong leader to take the country back from the wealthy. Those who felt the country was on the wrong track were three times as likely to vote for Trump as Clinton.  In a bitter and divisive campaign, Trump cleared a series of obstacles that would doom any other candidate: An audio tape in which he talked of groping women; a refusal to release his tax returns; violence at his rallies; his mockery of a disabled  reporter; and his attacks on the heritage of a federal judge and the Muslim family of a U.S. soldier.  He was an imperfect candidate with a near-perfect message, said Ford OConnell, a Republican strategist who has long backed Trump. I dont think a lot of people understood that. In a year when voters in the United States and abroad showed their antipathy toward the political establishment, the globalized economy, and corporate welfare, Trump guessed correctly he could ride that wave of discontent to the White House.  He exploited a growing divide in the country between whites and minorities, urbanites and rural residents, the college-educated and the working class. Trump beat Clinton among white men without a college degree by 31 points and white women without a degree by 27 points, according to the Reuters/Ipsos polling.  He also benefited from an opponent with her own flaws. Clinton was continually dragged down by questions over her use of a private email server while secretary of state and the activities of her family foundation, while her corporate-friendly background left some Democrats skeptical and unenthusiastic. That appeared to cost her support among women, young voters and minorities  three groups that are critical for Democrats to win big. Clinton won each of these groups, but by smaller margins than President Barack Obama held when he defeated Republican candidate Mitt Romney in 2012. Some 49 percent of women supported Clinton, the first woman nominee of a major party, while 47 percent supported Trump.  Among women between the ages of 18 and 34, about 55 percent supported Clinton, while 38 percent supported Trump. In 2012, 62 percent of young women supported Obama, while 36 percent supported Romney. White voters, especially men in rural areas, flocked to Trump in record numbers. Trump appealed to voters unhappy with the hollowing out of the countrys manufacturing sector and fearful of the countrys changing demographics, campaigning on a harsh anti-immigration message.   Trump won 56 percent of the white vote, while Clinton won just 39 percent. He dominated to an even greater degree in rural areas, where he beat Clinton by 27 points. Trump promised big things: that he would bring jobs back and punish outsourcing corporations, that he would restore the country to some unspecified early time of prosperity and security - even as unemployment tumbled below 5 percent. Specifics were never Trumps strength. Instead, he used an us versus them message to build voter enthusiasm in places where most Republican candidates never ventured, rural areas with voters who felt ignored by Washington. Matt Borges, the chairman of the Ohio Republican Party, said Trump, unlike Romney, made voters feel like they mattered. Before Trump, he said, we werent listening to what voters actually care about. Trump thumbed his nose at the extensive get-out-the-vote operation and data-rich organization that are seen as essential to a modern winning campaign.  His campaign relied instead on more unofficial networks of rabid supporters to get the word out. His advisers argued that he would bring scores of neglected white voters back into the political process, including blue-collar Democrats in places such as Pennsylvania. Until Trump, Republicans had not won Pennsylvania since 1988. Craig Robinson, a veteran of Iowa Republican politics, said pundits underestimated how Trumps strength in the primaries would carry over to the general election.  In an election where the conventional wisdom was proven wrong time and time again, they convinced themselves that conventional wisdom would prevail in the general election, Robinson said.The voters saw through it.

"In bid for history, Clinton fails to reach the mountaintop","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton came closer than any other woman to winning the White House on Tuesday but fell short for a second time, a bitter disappointment for a pioneering but polarizing American political figure. Seeking to win election to the office her husband Bill Clinton held from 1993 to 2001, Clinton, 69, lost her battle for the Democratic presidential nomination to Barack Obama in 2008 and lost on Tuesday to Republican Donald Trump, 70. Trump told supporters at a rally early on Wednesday that Clinton had phoned to congratulate him on his victory. A Clinton campaign aide confirmed the phone call. In 2000, Clinton became the only first lady to win elected office, as a U.S. senator from New York. In 2009, she became the third female secretary of state. In July, she became the first woman to claim a major U.S. partys presidential nomination.  The presidency turned out to be a bridge too far. Accepting her partys nomination in July, she embraced the historic nature of her candidacy, saying that when any barrier falls in America it clears the way for everyone. After all, when there are no ceilings, the skys the limit. So lets keep going. Lets keep going until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves to have.     During four decades in public life, Clinton withstood such controversies as an FBI investigation of her use of a private email server as secretary of state, probes into past business dealings, her husbands infidelity and an unsuccessful Republican effort to remove him from office. Two American women, Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and Sarah Palin in 2008, were nominated by major parties as their vice presidential nominees, but fell short in the general election. After losing to Obama in the 2008 race, Clinton deferred her White House ambitions, and served as his secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Clintons admirers consider her a tough, capable and sometimes inspirational leader who endured unrelenting efforts by political enemies to chop her down. Campaigning for her on Monday in Michigan, Obama called Clinton a candidate who is smart, a candidate whos steady, a candidate whos tested - probably the most qualified person ever to run for this office. Her detractors consider her an unscrupulous and power-hungry opportunist. She was detested by many Republicans and conservatives, and in 1998 during her husbands presidency bemoaned a vast right-wing conspiracy. Against Trump, she portrayed herself as guarding the country from the threat she said he posed to American democracy. As Ive told people, Im the last thing standing between you and the apocalypse, Clinton told The New York Times in October. When she entered the race last year for the Democratic presidential nomination, she was considered such a prohibitive favorite that others in her party shied away from challenging her. But she was an establishment figure and a Washington insider at a time when voters were smitten with outsiders. She secured the Democratic nomination in July only after beating back a surprisingly stout challenge from U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who appealed to young voters and mustered the kind of excitement that Clinton sometimes failed to generate. As secretary of state, she dealt with civil wars in Syria and Libya, Irans nuclear program, Chinas growing clout, Russian assertiveness, ending the Iraq war, winding down the Afghanistan war, and an unsuccessful bid to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Congressional Republicans spent years investigating allegations of State Department security lapses related to a 2012 attack by militants in the Libyan city of Benghazi that killed the U.S. ambassador. She testified during marathon congressional hearings in January 2013 at the end of her tenure at the State Department and in October 2015, while already a candidate for president, facing Republican criticism of her handling of the incident. Another politically damaging issue came to light during the lengthy congressional investigation into the Benghazi attack: accusations that she broke the law in her handling of classified information while corresponding through the private email server for her government work as secretary of state. The U.S. Justice Department in July accepted FBI Director James Comeys recommendation not to bring criminal charges against her, although he faulted her extremely careless  handling of classified information. Comey announced 11 days before the election that the FBI was investigating a new collection of emails as part of its probe, but said two days before the election that a review of those emails produced nothing that would change the decision not to bring charges. Trump called her Crooked Hillary, said he would seek to put her behind bars if elected and encouraged his supporters to chant lock her up. Clinton called Trump as a racist hate-monger, a sexist and a tax-dodger enamored with Russian President Vladimir Putin. She defended her lengthy service in government, dismissing Trumps contention that she had produced no real accomplishments. Born in Chicago on Oct. 26, 1947, Hillary Rodham Clinton was  the eldest of three children of a small-business owner father she called a rock-ribbed, up-by-your-bootstraps, conservative Republican and a mother who was a closet Democrat. She attended public schools, then enrolled in 1965 at all-female Wellesley College in Massachusetts, where she headed the Young Republicans Club. Her political views changed during the 1960s civil rights struggles and Vietnam War escalation and she switched parties. At Yale Law School, she met a similarly ambitious fellow student from Arkansas, Bill Clinton, and they became a couple. She moved to Washington to work for a congressional panel in the impeachment drive against Nixon, who resigned as president in 1974 during the Watergate scandal. She moved to Arkansas to be with Bill, married him in 1975, and was hired by a top law firm. He jumped into politics, eventually being elected governor, at age 32, in 1978. She gave birth to the couples only child, daughter Chelsea, in 1980. As Arkansas first lady, she was a high-powered lawyer in the capital Little Rock and a Wal-Mart corporate board member. Most Americans were introduced to her during her husbands bid for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Bill Clinton said voters would get two for the price of one if they elected him. She unapologetically said she was not a woman who stayed home and baked cookies. After a woman named Gennifer Flowers accused Bill Clinton during the campaign of a sexual affair, Hillary Clinton appeared on TV with her husband and referred to singer Tammy Wynettes song, Stand by Your Man. You know, Im not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette, she said, adding that she loved and respected her husband. And you know, if thats not enough for people, then heck, dont vote for him, she added.  Conservative critics painted her as a radical feminist and a threat to traditional family values. Bill Clinton defeated incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush in November 1992. As first lady from 1993 to 2001, unlike many of her predecessors, she was an active part of policymaking. Critics assailed her unsuccessful effort to win congressional passage of healthcare reform, deriding it as Hillarycare. She and her husband faced a long investigation into past business dealings but ultimately no criminal charges were brought. A real estate venture known as Whitewater faced scrutiny, spawning an independent counsel investigation that later encompassed Bill Clintons sexual relationship with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster, a figure in the Whitewater controversy and a close friend of the Clintons from Arkansas, was found dead of a gunshot in 1993. His death was ruled a suicide. In a 2003 memoir, Hillary Clinton blasted conspiracy theorists and investigators trying to prove that Vince was murdered to cover up what he knew about Whitewater.  In 2000, the independent counsel investigation concluded there was insufficient evidence to show the Clintons had been involved in any criminal behavior related to Whitewater. In December 1998, the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to impeach a president for only the second time in U.S. history, charging Bill Clinton with high crimes and misdemeanors for allegedly lying under oath and obstructing justice to cover up his relationship with Lewinsky. The Republican-led Senate acquitted Clinton in February 1999. Hillary Clinton called the impeachment an abuse of power by Republicans with a Soviet-style show trial and condemned what she called an attempted congressional coup detat. She also said she wanted to wring Bills neck for the affair and upbraided him privately. Ultimately, she said, she decided she still loved him and remained after they went through counseling. She launched her own bid for elected office and won election in 2000 as a U.S. senator. The 2008 race for the Democratic presidential nomination pitted Americas foremost woman politician against the son of a black Kenyan father and a white Kansan mother. After vanquishing Clinton, Obama made history when he defeated Republican John McCain to become the first black U.S. president. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
Turkey hopes for better cooperation with Trump on fighting terror: PM,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said on Wednesday he hoped for an improvement in ties with the United States after Donald Trumps election victory, and called for the extradition of the U.S.-based cleric Turkey blames for a failed July coup. President Tayyip Erdogan, whose relations with outgoing U.S. President Barack Obama have at times been strained, meanwhile said he hoped Trumps victory would lead to beneficial steps for the Middle East and for basic rights and freedoms. Turkey has been frustrated by what it sees as Washingtons reluctance to hand over cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom it accuses of masterminding an abortive putsch four months ago and who has lived in exile in Pennsylvania since 1999. An area of opportunity has been created for the new president to advance relations with policies taking into account Turkeys fight against terror, Yildirim said in a speech broadcast on Turkish television. A new page will be opened for Turkish-U.S. friendship if you soon hand over the terror group leader who has harmed the friendship between the U.S. and Turkey, he said, in reference to Gulen. The cleric denies involvement in Julys failed coup. Turkey, a NATO member and sometimes fractious ally in the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, has also been angered by U.S. support for the Kurdish YPG militia in Syria, which it sees as a hostile force linked to Kurdish militants who have fought the Turkish state for more than three decades. A senior Turkish official told Reuters that statements from Trump indicating he would withdraw support from terror groups was critically important for Turkey. We expect the development of better relations in the period ahead, the official said. It is a positive development in itself that the United States will put a distance between itself and terror groups like the YPG, and it will be an important step for establishing healthier balances in the Middle East. Erdogan made only brief reference to the U.S. election result at the end of a speech to a business forum in Istanbul. I hope that this choice of the American people will lead to beneficial steps being taken for the world concerning basic rights and freedoms, democracy and developments in our region, he said.

"Scottish leader says Trump win brings ""real sense of anxiety' for many","EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Scotlands First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Donald Trump on winning the U.S. presidential election on Wednesday but said many would feel anxious about his victory. It is normal in any election for those on the losing side to feel disappointment, but today, many in America and across the world, will also feel a real sense of anxiety, Sturgeon said in statement. Trump, whose mother was Scottish, owns two golf courses on the west and east coasts of Scotland. He has made much of his Scottish roots, telling a Scottish newspaper earlier this year that just as he had won over Scotland, where he faced fierce local resistance to some of his development plans, he would win over the United States. Sturgeon has long been vocal on her distaste for Trump and endorsed his opponent Hillary Clinton as recently as Tuesday. While this is not the outcome I hoped for, it is the verdict of the American people and we must respect it. I congratulate president-elect Trump on winning the election, she said.

Kremlin: renewed dialogue needed between Washington and Moscow,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Suggestions Russia interfered in the U.S. presidential election are absurd and a renewed dialogue is needed between Washington and Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday.

He said Russia hoped coordination with United States on the Syria crisis would improve under the new U.S. president.  ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
Highest glass ceiling remains intact after Clinton's stunning loss,"(Reuters) - They wore pantsuits to their polling places, emulating the preferred dress of their White House candidate. Some wept with emotion and others remembered their female ancestors as they cast their vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton. But rather than witness the shattering of the ultimate glass ceiling, women across America watched an historic breakthrough slip away as Clinton failed to become the first woman elected president of the United States. Republican Donald Trump, who had waged a heated campaign painting the former secretary of state as  crooked and threatening to put her in jail, swept to surprise victory on an anti-establishment platform. I was looking forward to having a woman president. I really was. I cant believe people voted for that terrible man, said Mariana Mejia, 61, sitting at a subdued party at California Democratic Party headquarters in Sacramento. Some women defied their own political tradition to vote for the first woman presidential nominee of a major U.S. political party. Republican Cassandra Pye, a pioneering African-American political consultant who advised former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, said she felt the pull of history as she cast her ballot for Clinton. I feel like even though I vote in the booth alone, there are always people in there with me, Pye said. My ancestors, my mother, my aunties - there were a lot of people in the booth with me today. A polarizing figure with a long history in the public eye, Clinton entered the White House as first lady in 1993, after her husband, Bill Clinton, defeated incumbent George H. W. Bush. Her ambition immediately clashed with the publics image of a first lady, and Clinton won enemies as swiftly as she earned the adoration of many progressive women. When she lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama in 2008, Clinton conceded that although we werent able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, its got about 18 million cracks in it, referring to the number of votes she had won.  Women who had pinned their hopes on Clinton gave a nod to their political history on Tuesday, forming a long line to leave I Voted Today stickers on the gravestone of womens suffrage activist Susan B. Anthony.  Others, dressed in white like the suffragettes who campaigned for a womans right to vote and wearing pantsuits like those favored by Clinton, posed for photos at state Capitol buildings and other iconic locations. Several bemoaned the fact that U.S. women won the right to vote in 1920 and nearly a century later the country has yet to elect a woman president.         Its been such a hard struggle for women, a very hard struggle, said U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer, who in 1992 made history along with Senator Dianne Feinstein as the first women elected from California to the U.S. Senate. Its a very emotional moment. Trump, a wealthy real estate developer and former reality TV star, defied political correctness with comments that angered women, minorities and the disabled. He denied allegations by several women that he groped them after the emergence of a video where he boasted about making unwanted sexual advances on women.    At the Sacramento Democratic party gathering, some women lamented his victory and the long, difficult trek for women to win positions of power.  I thought by the time I hit 61 it would be different for women and minorities, said Chris Cage, 61, a former journalist and labor organizer. I see a victory for Trump as a vote against both.

Must accept Trump win but not what most Germans wanted: German foreign minister,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germanys foreign minister said on Wednesday that U.S. Republican Donald Trumps victory in the presidential election was not what most Germans had wanted and added that Washingtons foreign policy would no longer be as foreseeable as it has been. The result is not to be underestimated. The result is different from what most people in Germany desired. But of course we have to accept it, Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said. In the course of the election campaign Donald Trump has found critical words about Europe and Germany. We must adjust to the fact that American foreign policy will get less predictable in the near future, he added. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
Republicans defend grip on U.S. Congress as Trump wins presidency,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans maintained their majorities in both chambers of the U.S. Congress in a momentous election on Tuesday in which Republican Donald Trump won the presidency, empowering the party to reshape Washington. The Republican sweep sets up the United States for two years of unified government, which would normally mean significant policy change, although Trumps election was anything but normal and he will start his presidency with unusual handicaps.  Both Republican leaders on Capitol Hill held Trump at arms length during the campaign. Trump offended and attacked some congressional Republicans on the stump, including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan. Early on Wednesday, shortly after Clinton conceded to Trump, Ryan said in a statement: We are eager to work hand-in-hand with the new administration to advance an agenda to improve the lives of the American people. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, also a Republican,  said in a guarded and similarly timed statement: The American people have chosen a new direction for our nation. The new Congress will not convene until Jan. 3, but the lame-duck Congress will return next week and Republicans are set to begin the process of picking leaders for both chambers. Ryans position as speaker could be challenged by Republican conservatives who backed Trump and it remains to be seen if the president-elect himself will try to push Ryan out. Trump seems magnanimous right now, an aide to one of Trumps House supporters said after Trump stressed unity in his victory speech in New York. We shall see. In a huge disappointment to Democrats, Republicans were on a pace to lose only a handful of seats in the House, well below the double-digit losses some predicted. Similarly, Democrats gained only one seat in the Senate, although a few races were still to be determined, including New Hampshire, where incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte was deadlocked with Democrat Maggie Hassan early on Wednesday. In Illinois, Democratic U.S. Representative Tammy Duckworth defeated Republican Senator Mark Kirk. Democrats needed to pick up a net five seats to win Senate control. Republican successes came on the heels of big Republican gains in the 2014 congressional elections and defied predictions the party was in tatters and on the verge of splitting apart because of deep divisions over Trump. Congressional Republicans are sure to flex their muscles on a range of legislation, not the least of which is fulfilling a six-year quest to repeal President Barack Obamas landmark healthcare law known as Obamacare. Republicans also campaigned on an agenda that shunned comprehensive immigration reform and opposed gun control and expanded environmental and financial regulations. In the Senate, McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, was expected to remain at his post for at least the next two years. Paul Sracic, who chairs the politics department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, said: There was all this concern that Trump would damage Republicans down-ticket. Just the opposite happened as Trump brought out more Republican voters. Come January, Republicans will have to pivot from trying to block Obamas initiatives - such as his signature health insurance program Obamacare - to governing along with Trump. Republicans no longer have the luxury of being the opposition party, said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University. For example, will they actually repeal Obamacare and agree what to implement in its place? she added. McConnell led conservatives opposition to any Supreme Court nominee named by Obama following last Februarys death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. His gamble paid off and he will now await a nomination from Trump, likely dooming Obamas choice of federal judge Merrick Garland. Star-power incumbent Republicans, such as Senator John McCain in Arizona and Marco Rubio in Florida, also scored victories.  Issues ranging from tax cuts to border security will now take center stage in Washington. Trumps opposition to trade deals with foreign countries puts in serious jeopardy the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement negotiated by Obama that would cover economies from Japan to Chile. In terms of trade, I think TPP is dead. The stake went through its heart tonight, Sracic said. ",politicsNews,"November 8, 2016 ",1

EU eyes more self-reliance after Trump victory,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union must take responsibility for dealing with neighbors Russia, Africa and the Middle East, its commissioner for neighborhood policy said on Wednesday after Donald Trump was elected U.S. president. Europe must shoulder its own share of international responsibility, especially in its neighborhood, Johannes Hahn said on Twitter, although he also said: America and Europe have always been strongest when they worked together. During his campaign, Trump promised radical changes in U.S. policy, praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and questioned the cost of U.S. military and other commitments in Europe. The EU faces a more aggressive Russia to the east, conflicts in the Middle East to the south and an increased threat from Islamist militants among others. The conservative leader in the European Parliament, Manfred Weber, an ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said: The message is clear: it is now up to Europe. We must be more self-confident and assume more responsibility. We do not know what to expect from the USA. For the political culture in Europe, this is another wake-up call.

'Go to hell!' A divided America struggles to heal after ugly election," (Editors note: Attention to language in paragraph 30 that may be offensive to some readers) By Jason Szep ELLSWORTH, Maine (Reuters) - He lies, huffed Janet Foster. And hes a dirty old man, chimed in her sister Jean as they discussed Donald Trumps flaws a few days before he was elected the new president of the United States. Well, I am with him, their brother Paul, 60, interjected, raising his voice over snacks of cheese, muffins and crackers in the familys living room. Hillary Clinton is like a puppet - you know its all scripted. The 2016 U.S. election was unprecedented in the way it turned Americans against each other, according to dozens of interviews in rural United States and across some of the most politically charged battleground states.  It divided families like the Fosters in rural Ellsworth, Maine, broke up friendships and turned neighbor against neighbor. In a recent Reuters/Ipsos survey, 15 percent of respondents said they had stopped talking to a family member or close friend as a result of the election. For Democrats, this shoots up to 23 percent, compared to 10 percent for Republicans. And 12 percent had ended a relationship because of it. There was no comparative polling data from previous elections. But interviews with relationship counselors and voters suggest this election stood out by summoning passions, anger and a divisiveness in ways that will make healing difficult after Clintons loss to Trump on Tuesday. Sarah Guth, a Democrat in Colorado, says her father - an ardent supporter of Trump - no longer speaks with her after they clashed on Facebook over their political views. He crossed a line, she said. After attending a Trump rally, Guth wrote on Facebook that she saw 10 minorities among thousands of people.Im increasingly convinced that this election is about race, she wrote. I mean a fear among the white majority that their rule is coming to an end. Some posters told her to go to hell, she recalled in an interview. And then my dad very publicly attacked me, telling me that I should be ashamed of myself. The two have not spoken since. Ty Turner-Bond, a 35-year-old black man in North Carolina, says he lost friends because of his support for Trump. Some called him an Uncle Tom, a slur for African Americans accused of deferring to white people; others threatened violence. In Springfield, a city on Ohios Mad River, Duke Level, 57, voted for Trump because he wanted a wrecking ball to hit Washington. The owner of Un Mundo Cafe isnt surprised this election created divisions, and he fears they could get worse. This is one of those crossroads crisis moments in history, he said.  Hours earlier, Trump rallied about 5,000 supporters a few miles away in a dirt-floored livestock arena. He blasted Clinton as the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency, drawing chants of lock her up, as well as a few of string her up. Down the street, Richard Scott, 51, an African-American supporting Clinton, shook his head when told of those chants. Those words, he said, recalled 20th Century lynchings of black Americans - including in Springfield where a black prisoner was shot and hung from a pole on Main Street in 1904. Its terrible, he said. Weeks ago, he planted a Clinton sign in his yard. His neighbors put up Trump signs. Outside the funeral home he owns, a pro-Clinton sign was defaced with a Hillary for Prison sticker. People are tense, said Scott. The election hardened an already-clear racial divide in the former industrial city of 60,000 people - a snapshot of America at about 75 percent white and 18 percent black. Interviews with residents suggested its northern areas, mostly affluent and white, would vote for Trump, while its mostly black, lower-income southern section would largely support Clinton. There is a division in this town, economically and racial. And we saw that in this election, said Bob Leath, 58, owner of Buckeye PC Repair who voted for Trump to clean house in Washington. If you voted for Clinton, you were most likely either young, lower-income or from the south side of the area. For some, the tensions reach the bedroom. Sam Nail, a Cincinnati marriage counselor, said he has two couples who cited the election season as a stressor in their relationship. Much of the anger gets uncorked on social media and will be hard to undo. Some is well publicized. National Review writer David French has written about an unending torrent of abuse he and his family faced online from white nationalist Trump supporters, including a Tweeted image of his 7-year-old daughters face in a gas chamber. Others are less well known, like Brenda Thomas tangles with her older brother on Facebook. She says her brother unleashed a daily stream of Facebook posts on Clinton and President Barack Obama that she found objectionable. She said when her husband, a Republican, tried to reason with him, he was unfriended on Facebook. I feel that I have to walk on eggshells with him and it causes problems at family functions, said Thomas, 63, of Elizabethtown, Kentucky. In Charlotte, North Carolina, Karen Wilson, describes this election as stressful on Facebook. Ive got family members who are mad at me for deleting entire Facebook threads when I thought they were becoming too negative. Ive deleted Facebook friends who I realized I never should have been friends with in the first place, said Wilson, 43.  Fourteen percent of respondents in the Reuters/Ipsos poll said they had blocked a family member or close friend from social media because of the election. For Democrats, this rises to 23 percent compared to 8 percent for Republicans. The divisions tore into the fabric of some communities. In Provo, Utah, Trump supporter Loy Brunson awoke on an October morning to find his car spray-painted with the words AmeriKKKa - a reference to KKK white supremacists - and Fuck Trump. His two Trump yard signs were destroyed. So I doubled down, got motivated and put up 85 signs in my yard, he said. Within days, all but six of those were stolen. This was more than vandalism, he said in an interview. This was a free speech attack. Some blame the divisiveness on campaign rhetoric that inflamed racial, ethnic and class tensions that have long simmered in America. Angry and extremist language moved into the mainstream.  George Lakoff, a linguistics professor at University of California, Berkeley, blames Trumps use of language, which he ranks as among the most violent of any candidate in modern times. He specifically notes Trumps suggestion in August that gun rights activists could take matters into their own hands if Clinton defeated him, as well as the New York businessmans comments that she should go to prison. When you have extremes of that order, you have extremes of anger, extremes of fear, Lakoff said. In Mississippi, Chad Scott, an activist in the Clay County Republican Party, fears a post-election split between the partys working-class Trump supporters and business-minded elites - a sentiment echoed in Maine, where Foster, the Ellsworth resident at odds with his sisters, witnessed the elections political vitriol first hand. Fosters van was one of 20 vehicles spray-painted outside a Trump rally on Oct. 15 in the city of Bangor. And across Ellsworth, pro-Trump yard signs were stolen almost as fast as they were planted, Republican officials say.  Foster worries about the divisions ahead.  My sisters will forgive me for my political views, he said.But the country is going to be on fire. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1

Outlines of Trump foreign policy are largely uncharted territory,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump may try to improve ties with Russia, tear up trade deals with Mexico and Pacific nations and abandon U.S. allies in Europe and Asia if they dont spend more on their own defense - or, he may not. Foreign governments are uncertain how much of Trumps rhetoric will be translated into policy because he has frequently made contradictory statements and provided few details of how he would deal with the world or who he would appoint to key posts. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault pledged to work with Trump but said his personality raised questions and he admitted to being unsure what a Trump presidency would mean for key foreign policy challenges, from climate change and the Wests nuclear deal with Iran to the war in Syria. Trump, who has no foreign affairs or military experience, will confront the absence of a national or even Republican political consensus on how to deal with Syria, the Islamic State militant group, the rise of China and a newly assertive Russia. This is virtual terra incognita, said Aaron David Miller, a Middle East negotiator who served Democratic and Republican presidents and is now with the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars in Washington. The biggest danger of a Trump presidency is the unpredictability and sheer lack of stability that our allies and adversaries would feel, and he turns that into a virtue by saying that he wants to be unpredictable, he said. Among the names said to be in consideration for top national security jobs in a Trump administration are former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich and one-time United Nations ambassador John Bolton for secretary of state, and General Michael Flynn, a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, for national security adviser.A Republican foreign policy expert who has occasionally counseled Trump, cautioned that he is more likely to make his own decisions and impulses than to follow the advice of his aides. Many top Republicans have publicly repudiated him, and a number of professional diplomats, intelligence and military officers have privately said they would retire if Trump wins. If he does everything he says hes going to do, we can kiss goodbye our leadership role in the world, former CIA deputy director John McLaughlin told Reuters. So lets hope he doesnt mean it or that someone talks him out of it. Trump has suggested he could accept Japanese and South Korean nuclear arms development, abandon the Iran nuclear deal, negotiate with North Korea on its nuclear weapons program, and embrace Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump has adopted an open-minded stance toward Putin, whom many current and former U.S. officials consider an autocrat bent on suppressing dissent at home while bullying his neighbors and projecting Russias power abroad. Russia has annexed Crimea from Ukraine, backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and, according to U.S. intelligence officials, hacked  emails of prominent Democratic Party leaders and organizations. I would hope to have a good relationship with Russia and I would hope to have a good relationship with Putin, Trump told Reuters in an interview last month. If we had a good relationship with Russia that would be a wonderful thing. James Dobbins, a former U.S. diplomat now at the Rand Corp., said he would not be surprised to see an effort to reset U.S. relations with Russia. Trump has taken a more aggressive tone toward China, threatening to slap tariffs on Chinese products to show Beijing the United States is not playing games anymore when it comes to leveling the field on trade.  Chinas Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday it would work with Trump to ensure the steady development of bilateral ties. Trump also says he could scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement that took effect in Mexico, the United States and Canada in 1994, and he has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 35 percent on Mexican-made goods to help U.S. industry. Trump has taken aim at the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal championed by President Barack Obama, calling it a death blow for American manufacturing.  LESS CONFLICT-AVERSE Trump has also floated the idea of abandoning NATOs guarantee of mutual defense, suggesting that the United States would help defend other NATO members such as the Baltic states only if they had fulfilled their obligations to us. Asked in March if he would object if Japan or South Korea developed their own nuclear weapons, Trump told the New York Times there might come a time that the United States could not protect them as it has in the past and they might need to develop their own arsenals. Both positions violate bedrock principles of U.S. foreign policy that have stood for decades: that an attack on one NATO member would be regarded as an attack on all and that the proliferation of nuclear weapons is to be avoided at all costs. Jon Alterman, the head of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, said Trumps predilection for keeping other nations guessing could itself be a source of instability. Countries may feel more at risk and maybe less conflict-averse if they feel they have to protect themselves, he said. Robert Zoellick, a former deputy secretary of state who in May signed a letter saying Trump would be the most reckless president on American history, suggested that Trumps temperament could lead to unexpected outcomes. No one knows how Mr. Trumps vanity will respond if a foreign counterpart diminishes him, he wrote in the Financial Times last month. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
"With Trump win, Republican chairman Priebus emerges as key adviser","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trumps White House victory puts a spotlight on Reince Priebus, an establishment Republican figure who emerged as a trusted adviser to the New York businessman and helped encourage discipline in the campaigns final weeks. Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, has been mentioned as a contender for chief of staff. In a pre-election interview, Priebus told Reuters that Trump won over voters who were frustrated with Washington and its politicians. They viewed Donald Trump as the antidote to so many things that theyre frustrated with, whether it be Washington, whether it be their job, whether it be what they were promised, and all sorts of things in life, and how it wasnt delivered, he said. And Trump was the antidote to all of those feelings. Trumps victory was a vindication for Priebus, who refused to bow to pressure to distance the party apparatus from him. He talked to Trump almost every day, sometimes more than once a day, and frequently traveled with the candidate. He helped prepare him for Trumps debates against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump made clear his high regard for Priebus when he invited him on stage during his victory speech early Wednesday morning and asked him to say a few words. Comparing Priebus to the race horse Secretariat, Trump said, I tell you Reince is really a star and he is the hardest-working guy. Henry Barbour, an RNC member from Mississippi, said Priebus had developed a position of trust with Trump. He had regular conversations with Trump about different ideas and not surprisingly some ideas Trump had were probably not the greatest and Reince kind of talked him off some of those cliffs, he said. Once Trump vanquished 16 seasoned politicians to win the Republican presidential nomination, Priebus threw the weight of the RNC behind Trump and built a voter turnout effort that paid off despite Trumps refusal to invest more money in it. He has been a prodigious fundraiser. He invested heavily in bringing our data and analytics up to speed, and he put the full resources of the RNC to help build out the Trump campaign, said Steve Duprey, a prominent Republican from New Hampshire.  And he helped coach Donald Trump in how to be a presidential candidate.  Trumps unpredictable nature and views on issues such as trade that break with Republican party orthodoxy have led to rifts with many establishment figures in the party. But Priebus told Reuters that his staunch support for Trump was based on the fact that Trump won more Republican votes than any previous nominee, 14.5 million. These are the same people who say the party is irrelevant and in the next breath they say that the party ought to singlehandedly nullify the wishes of 14.5 million people, he said. If Trump had lost, Priebus would have faced pressure to step down as party chairman, since he also presided over the loss of Mitt Romney in 2012. He remains extremely popular among the 168 elected members of the RNC who would most likely re-elect him. Priebus is being talked about for re-election at the RNC or possibly being appointed by Trump to serve as his White House chief of staff, where he may be a potential conduit between Trump and Paul Ryan, the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. Both Priebus and Ryan hail from Wisconsin and are friends. We hope Priebus goes into the Trump White House in a senior position, said Scott Reed, a prominent Republican strategist in Washington. Asked whether he would seek re-election as RNC chairman, Priebus said he did not yet know. Ive honestly put that in a box and decided that I would deal with it Wednesday or Thursday, kind of think about it a little bit, kind of see where things are at, he said.

"Fed up with Washington, Trump's 'deplorables' shake up the elite","MIAMI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fed up with Washington and feeling left behind, supporters of Republican Donald Trump upended the U.S. presidential race, electing a political newcomer they say offers the country a shot at dramatic change. Once dismissed by Trumps Democratic rival Hillary Clinton as deplorables, supporters interviewed on Tuesday shrugged off his late-night tweeted insults, allegations against him of sexual misconduct and dire warnings from many in the Republican establishment that the businessman-turned-reality-television-star would throw U.S. economic and foreign policy into disarray. The economy, terrorism and healthcare ranked as the top three concerns facing Americans casting ballots in Tuesdays election, according to an early reading from the Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll of about 35,000 people. The freedom-loving Americans pushed back against the elites and the globalists. They might win in the long run, but were not dead yet, said Andrew Dye, 48, of Dexter, Michigan. I think this big country is getting a little too far left a little too quickly and some people finally woke up and said enough, said Dye, a partner in a small management consulting firm. Cuban-American Sarah Gird, 67, described herself as an independent who had felt let down after twice voting for Democratic President Barack Obama. Im not conservative at all, she said. But Obama didnt produce anything. In contrast, she said she trusted Trump would fix the economy. I think hes sincere, hes truthful, he means what he says, said Gird, adding she thought Trump would address poverty and jobs in African-American neighborhoods. For many, the vote was a rejection of Clinton, whose use of a private email server during her time in government came to symbolize what is wrong with Washington. All the corruption. Im tired of business as usual, being sold out all these years, said Kevin Barrett, 57, in Nashville. Tom Kipp, 53, an architect also of Nashville, said he voted for Trump because we need somebody in there not beholden to anyone. Our checks and balances system is beyond being compromised. I dont say hes my prime candidate, but hes my best option, Kipp said. Others found Trumps promise to build a wall on the southern border with Mexico appealing. Last-minute decision: I changed my mind to Trump, said Lisa Ciafone, 48, of Madeira Beach, Florida, citing her concerns about illegal immigration and the rising costs of health insurance. It made me lean towards Trump. Vicki DeLira, 54, a dental hygienist from Schererville, Indiana, grew up a Democrat but voted for Trump because it was time for change even if it means a little bit of chaos. It will be a little different atmosphere for a non-politician to be in the White House, DeLira said. But I think theres enough politicians around him to help round them out. Todd Recknagel, managing partner of private equity firm Three20 Capital Group, said the caricature of Trump as a monster was overdone. He is an effective business man at the end of the day. So things are never quite as good as they appear and things are never quite as bad as they appear in life and I think he can make a decent president, said Recknagel, 52, from Panama City Beach, Florida. As Trump became the projected winner in state after state, fans from Arkansas, Texas and Virginia sitting on velvet sofas in the lobby of his new Washington luxury hotel just down the street from the White House celebrated as waiters popped champagne. Preston Parry, 20, had bet all along that Trump would defy the pollsters who predicted a Clinton victory. These were shadow voters, people who had never, ever voted before that the polls didnt pick up. Unlikely voters. Like him or hate him - look, he did something right.

EU parliament head hopes for 'rational cooperation' with Trump,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Parliament President Martin Schulz on Wednesday said he hoped for a rational cooperation with Donald Trump as the next U.S. president after a bitter political campaign.  It will not be easy because during the election campaign we heard some elements of protectionism, also some worrying words about women, about minorities, said Schulz, a German Social Democrat. But my experience is also that election campaigns are different from the real politics during a term of the president so I hope that we will get back to a rational cooperation, he said in televised remarks. In a separate written statement, he highlighted need for Trump to formulate more detailed policies after a campaign that capitalized on voters discontent with the status quo and he also listed key international policies that could be affected by the change of administration in Washington. Mr. Trump has managed to become the standard-bearer of the angst and fears of millions of Americans. Those concerns must now be addressed with credible policies, Schulz said. Vitriol and polarization have fueled this electoral contest. President Trump will have the daunting task of bringing together a divided nation. From Syria to Iraq, from Ukraine to Libya, Trumps role in diplomacy and dealmaking will be tested from Day One, he added. From the fight against global warming to its commitment to NATO, the world awaits and hopes for an outward-looking presidency aiming at shaping international relations and upholding the values of freedom and democracy.

Hungarian PM Orban hails Trump victory as 'great news',"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban congratulated U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on his election victory on Wednesday, with the words What a great news. Democracy is still alive posted on his Facebook page. Orban said in July that Trumps plans on migration and foreign policy were vital for Hungary, whereas those of rival Democrat Hillary Clinton were deadly. Orban was then the first European head of state to express a clear preference for either of the two candidates. Orban has in the past upset fellow members of the European Union over policy, most recently with his tough stance on Europes migrant crisis, objecting to EU resettlement plans and having a fence built along Hungarys southern border. The migration and foreign policy advocated by the Republican candidate, Mr Trump, is good for Europe and vital for Hungary, Orban said in July. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
Wall Street elite stunned at Trump triumph,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - From plush penthouse apartments on the Upper East Side to bars in midtown Manhattan, New Yorks financial community watched in stunned dismay on Wednesday as Republican Donald Trump clinched the White House. An early party mood quickly soured as donors and supporters of Hillary Clinton realized that the Democratic candidate, Wall Streets preferred choice because she represented the status quo, had lost. Many were stuck for words. Not really much to say, said Marc Lasry, a billionaire credit investor. Trumps unpredictable pronouncements and opposition to free-trade agreements have made the real estate mogul unpopular with many financiers, who fear that he could disrupt global trade and damage geopolitical relationships. The U.S. dollar sank and stocks plummeted as investors fled risky assets. S&P 500 index futures crashed. Joseph Peiffer, a lawyer who has represented investors and others in class-action lawsuits, cracked open a third bottle of wine, his only in the case of an emergency bottle, while watching the returns during an election night party he hosted for about 20 friends and family members in his hometown of New Orleans. This seems like enough of an emergency to break it open, he said. Trumps pronouncements on the financial sector have perplexed Wall Street. On the one hand, he has pledged to dismantle much of the regulation put in place after the financial crisis, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. On the other hand, he has called for a 21st century version of the 1933 Glass-Steagall law that required the separation of commercial and investment banking. Trump has not said what that version would entail other than saying that he would prioritize helping African-American businesses get the credit they need.  Sometimes you hear him on the stump criticizing the banks, Peiffer said. Then his policy paper says he wants to deregulate the bank. The two things dont jive. But who knows what he really thinks. And we wont know that until he does it. For Trump supporters who work on Wall Street, his victory is a vindication. Im very happy, said Matthew Tyrmand, a private investor and contributor to the Breitbart News website, who was attending a Young Republicans party at a bar off Madison Avenue. Tyrmand, who had shorted stocks ahead of the election - a bet that stock prices will fall - said he had been called delusional for predicting a Trump win. Tyrmand said Trump would be good news for markets because he understands the benefit of letting businesses fail. He predicted equity markets would go through a prolonged correction before recovering. We will be healthier long term, he said. Around Tyrmand, other Trump supporters hugged one another, sang God Bless America, clinked glasses and called out M-A-G-A! - the acronym for Trumps campaign slogan, Make America Great Again.  But in one corner of the bar, a man and a woman downed shots before starting on fresh pints of beer. Asked if the drinks were out of celebration or depression, the response was quick: Depression, the man said, declining to give his name. But either way we drink Matthew Farley, a lawyer with Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP in New York, said he had been warning friends and colleagues about an electoral upset for months.  I told them that ... a significant portion of the country wanted someone to do a cannonball into the pool and mess up the status quo, said Farley, who advises Wall Street brokerages on regulation and arbitration issues. The cannonball party is not united. Theyre progressives and conservatives, but theyre fed up with the status quo and all they know is that anything is better than what we got. Trump supporter Steven Chiavarone, associate portfolio manager for Federated Global Investment Management Corp, a fund that invests in stocks, bonds and currencies globally, said the market gyrations should not be seen as a harbinger of doom. The world doesnt end. Assuming capitalism survives, you manage through the volatility and then find the opportunity. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1

Trump rewrote political playbook in successful White House bid,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps successful campaign for the White House broke every tradition and upended the political establishment with the same bluster, hyperbole and media mastery that made him one of the worlds best-known businessmen. Trump told supporters at a rally early on Wednesday he had received a call from his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton  congratulating him on his victory. From his grand Trump Tower escalator entrance into the Republican presidential race on June 16, 2015, Trump managed to be simultaneously charismatic and combative, elitist and populist, lewd and pious as he drilled into a lode of polarity and anti-Washington anger among American voters. It was his first run for public office and Trump, a real-estate developer, reality television star and self-confessed owner of a big ego, called it a movement, not a campaign. He drew large, enthusiastic crowds to rallies where people cheered him for just saying what everybodys thinking. Critics labeled him misogynistic, ill-informed, uncouth, unpresidential, a racist, a hypocrite, a demagogue and a sexual predator, all accusations he denied. It took Trump, 70, little more than 10 months to vanquish 16 other Republican candidates and win the partys nomination, becoming the first major party nominee without government experience since General Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s. He drew a record number of votes in primary contests but in so doing created a rift in the Republican Party. Then Trump squared off against Clinton, 69, in a race marked by controversies that included upheaval in his staff, charges he had groped women and unheeded demands that he release his tax records. He said that as president he would investigate Clinton for her use of email while secretary of state. He vowed to send her to jail. His campaign took a scandalous turn in October with the release of a 2005 video in which Trump, unaware he was being recorded, told a television entertainment reporter that he liked to kiss women without invitation and that, because he was rich and famous, he could grab them by the genitals with impunity. Trump dismissed the remarks as locker room talk and denied the subsequent accusations from more than 10 women who said he had groped them or made unwanted sexual advances. Throughout his campaign - and especially in his Republican convention speech in July - Trump described a dark America that had been knocked to its knees by China, Mexico, Russia and Islamic State. The American dream was dead, he said, smothered by malevolent business interests and corrupt politicians, and he said he alone could revive it. Trump said he would make America great again through the force of his personality, negotiating skill and business acumen. He offered vague plans to win economic concessions from China, to build a wall on the southern U.S. border to keep out undocumented immigrants and to make Mexico pay for it. He vowed to repeal Obamacare while being the greatest jobs president that God ever created and has proposed refusing entry to the United States of people from war-torn Middle Eastern nations, a modified version of an earlier proposed ban on Muslims. Trump promoted himself as the ultimate success story. He dated beautiful women, married three of them, had his own television show and erected skyscrapers that bore his name in big gold letters. Everything in his life was the greatest, the hugest, the classiest, the most successful, he said, even though critics assailed his experiences with bankruptcies, the failures of his Atlantic City, New Jersey, casinos and what they viewed as the misplaced pride he showed when presented with evidence he avoided paying taxes. Trump had flirted with presidential runs in the past and some initially saw his campaign as a vanity project meant to indulge his ego and burnish his brand. It was expected to be short-lived but as the election season progressed, he became the Republican front-runner, winning state nominating contests despite an unconventional campaign that relied on large-scale rallies and mostly ignored grass-roots work. His hired advisers came to realize there was only so much they could do to rein in Trump. His inner circle was dominated by his three oldest children - Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, along with Ivankas husband, Jared Kushner. The rise of Trump, once a registered Democrat, threatened to blow up the Republican Party. Its establishment challenged his commitment to their tenets and organized against him. Prominent Republicans - including former presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush and congressional leaders - shunned him or offered lukewarm support. Trump used Twitter as a weapon, firing off insults and mockery at those who offended him, including Crooked Hillary and Republican rivals Little Marco Rubio, Jeb Low Energy Bush and Lyin Ted Cruz. Another target was the family of a Muslim U.S. Army captain who died fighting in Iraq after the soldiers father had spoken against Trump at the Democratic National Convention. Trump sniped back for days despite his advisers urging him to move on. As of late October, The New York Times had counted 282 people and things he had insulted on Twitter since declaring his candidacy. The Trump candidacy was brimming with contradictions. The candidate who vowed to bring back jobs to the United States had his clothing line and campaign hats manufactured in foreign countries. The man who decried the corrupting power of money in politics boasted of having bought influence himself. Undocumented workers had been used on his building projects but as a candidate Trump vowed to ship illegal immigrants out of the country. He said no one respected women more than he did but even before the groping accusations emerged, he was branded a misogynist for making fun of the appearance of rival candidate Carly Fiorina and an apparent reference to the menstrual cycle of Fox News Megyn Kelly. Trumps campaign trail demeanor seemed to draw from his experiences as host of The Apprentice, a reality TV show where he barked a crowd-pleasing Youre fired! at contestants who fell short in competitions. His speeches were often unscripted and featured boasts on everything from his money to his IQ. He peppered them with dubiously sourced declarations, misperceptions and false statements. He suggested that gun rights activists could act to stop Clinton from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices, a remark the Clinton campaign called dangerous. Trump boasted of a fortune he put at $10 billion, although in September Forbes magazine estimated it at $3.7 billion, making him the 156th richest American. Trump regularly made comments that would have doomed a more conventional candidate, such as when he said his supporters were so loyal that he could shoot someone on 5th Avenue in New York and not lose a single vote. In May he would draw accusations of racism for questioning the impartiality of a judge - born in the United States to Mexican immigrants - who was hearing a lawsuit against him. No other candidate referred to the size of his genitals during a debate. He was flattered when Russian President Vladimir Putin called him a brilliant and talented leader.     Trump mocked Senator John McCain, the Republicans presidential candidate in 2008, for having been captured during the Vietnam War and said he wanted to punch a protester in the face at a Trump rally. Trump was born to money on June 14, 1946, in the New York City borough of Queens, the fourth of five children of Fred Trump, who would become one of the citys biggest developers and landlords, and his wife. It was Fred Trump who taught Donald the value of self-promotion and a killer instinct. By his own admission, Trump was not an easy child and in the eighth grade his parents sent him to the New York Military Academy in hopes of instilling needed discipline. Through student and medical deferments during the Vietnam War, Trump would never serve in the U.S. military but said the school gave him more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Trump went to work for his fathers company, which focused on the outer New York City boroughs of Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island and owned an estimated 15,000 apartments. In 1973 the Trumps were charged with racial bias in their rental practices before reaching a settlement with the U.S. government. With a $1 million loan from his father, Trump eventually went into business himself in Manhattan, where he became a regular at some of the citys most exclusive clubs and developed a reputation as a ladies man. He soon made his mark with a series of real estate and development deals, including redoing an old hotel at New Yorks Grand Central Terminal. In 1983 he opened his flagship, 58-story Trump Tower, which serves as both his primary residence and Trump Organization headquarters. More projects around the world would follow, including golf courses, the Mar-a-Lago private resort in Florida, New Yorks venerable Plaza Hotel and casinos. Trumps projects had mixed success. The flops included the real estate-oriented Trump University, Trump Mortgage, Trump Airlines and Trump Vodka but it was his experience with four casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, that took the golden luster off his empire. Timothy OBrien, author of TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald, wrote that in the 1990s Trump was out of money and twice had to go to his siblings for loans. A former employee said the Trump Organization would have shut down if the family had not come through but Trump disputed that in his 1997 book Trump: The Art of the Comeback. While he never filed for personal bankruptcy, the downturn in the gaming industry sentparts of Trumps corporate empireto bankruptcy court in 1991, 1992, 2004 and 2009. In the 2009 bankruptcy, the unsecured creditors received less than a penny on the dollar for their claim. Trump resigned as chairman four days before the filing. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
"Trump's chance of victory skyrockets on betting exchanges, online market","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Online trading platform PredictIt and bookermaker Paddy Power showed a massive reversal of fortune for U.S. presidential candidates Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton on Tuesday night, as the New York businessmans chances of taking the White House skyrocketed on both. Trump stunned many political experts, showing a slight edge on Clinton in several swing states after voting had ended in more than two-thirds of the 50 U.S. states. Paddy Power put Trumps chance of victory at 83.3 percent Tuesday and Clintons at 22.2 percent. The two had been in essentially opposite positions on Tuesday morning. The Irish bookmaker stands to take a $4 million hit if Trump wins, said Paddy Power spokesman Filim Mac An Iomaire, who said the dramatic reversal in odds was reminiscent of what it saw in the Brexit vote for Britain to leave the European Union. You could say its deja vu again, said Mac An Iomaire. Much like Brexit, it looked to be following the odds early on before a dramatic turnaround. While opinion polls went back and forth leading into Britains June 23 referendum on whether or not to remain in the EU, betting odds favored the remain campaign. Britons voted to leave by 52 percent to 48 percent.  A similar trajectory played out on the online trading platform PredictIt, which was launched in 2014 and is jointly run by Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, and Washington-based political consulting firm Aristotle International Inc. Clinton led Trump in PredictIts market on who will win the White House throughout the campaign, but news of her Republican challengers surprise momentum sent her chance of winning the election plummeting roughly 75 percentage points from its level Tuesday morning to 5 percent. Trumps chance, meanwhile, shot up more than 40 percentage points to around 65 percent.  It was the first time in the entire campaign that Trump had led Clinton on the platform, according to a PredictIt spokeswoman. British gambling company Ladbrokes had Trumps chance of victory at roughly 85 percent Tuesday night, compared with 15 percent for Clinton. Ladbrokes had earlier in the day placed Clintons chance of victory at 76 percent and Trumps at 24 percent, but company spokeswoman Jessica Bridge said the development isnt a surprise in the slightest, given the high volume of trades made on Trump since the market opened in 2012. Roughly 75 percent of all bets in Ladbrokes U.S. presidential wagering had been placed on Trump. ",politicsNews,"November 8, 2016 ",1
U.S. voters want leader to end advantage of rich and powerful: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans who had cast their votes for the next president early on Tuesday appeared to be worried about the direction of the country, and were looking for a strong leader who can take the country back from the rich and powerful, according to an early reading from the Reuters/Ipsos national Election Day poll. The poll of more than 10,000 people who have already cast their ballots in the presidential election showed a majority of voters are worried about their ability to get ahead and have little confidence in political parties or the media to improve their situation. A majority also feel that the economy is rigged to mostly help the wealthy. The poll, which will be updated as additional responses are tallied and votes are counted throughout Tuesday, found: - 75 percent agree that America needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful. - 72 percent agree the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful. - 68 percent agree that traditional parties and politicians dont care about people like me. - 76 percent believe the mainstream media is more interested in making money than telling the truth. - 57 percent feel that more and more, I dont identify with what America has become. - 54 percent feel it is increasingly hard for someone like me to get ahead in America. The Reuters/Ipsos online opinion poll was conducted on Election Day in English in all 50 states. It includes 10,604 Americans who have already cast their vote in the presidential election and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 1 percentage point.

Colorado voters reject measure to create universal healthcare,"(Reuters) - Colorado voters rejected a ballot measure on Tuesday to create the nations first statewide universal health insurance program, according to local NBC News affiliate 9News. The proposition, called Amendment 69, would have created one of the most dramatic overhauls to a public healthcare system in U.S. history. Colorados 9News reported that the amendment was defeated on Tuesday night, after early results showed an overwhelming defeat. Dubbed ColoradoCare, the program would have been funded largely through a new 10 percent payroll tax increase intended to raise $25 billion in 2019, the first year the program could launch, according to the Colorado Health Institute. ColoradoCare was intended to greatly reduce the number of uninsured residents in the state, but opponents feared the tax hike and sweeping changes to public policy would ripple through the states economy. James Merilatt, 43, an unaffiliated voter who supported Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in Tuesdays election, said he opposed the single-payer healthcare measure. Its way too complicated and would have opened up a Pandoras Box, said Merilatt, who works in the publishing industry. ",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
Republican Speaker Ryan re-elected to U.S. House from Wisconsin,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Paul Ryan was re-elected to the U.S. House of Representatives by voters in his Wisconsin district on Tuesday, positioning him to reassert his claim to remain speaker of the House, the highest-ranking post in the U.S. Congress. The 2012 vice presidential nominee, if returned to the speakers chair by House members, may have a smaller Republican majority to work with if voters elect fewer Republicans. Most House races were still undecided. Like all members of the House, other Republicans were also running for re-election from their home districts, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana. Along with Ryan, they were expected to seek re-election to their leadership posts. Closed-door leadership elections in both parties were expected to take place later in November. A new speaker will be elected by all members of Congress in January. Ryan, 46, has been speaker since October 2015. His re-election to that job is not certain. Some House conservatives have criticized him, and they may have a stronger hand after Tuesdays voting. A number of Republican lawmakers were angered in October when Ryan said he would not campaign with or defend Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who was in a closely fought race with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Tuesday night.

"U.S. election largely peaceful, despite intimidation, glitches","WASHINGTON/PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Voters and civil rights groups reported long lines, isolated cases of malfunctioning equipment and some harassment at polling places in Tuesdays U.S. presidential election but fears of widespread violence at the polls did not materialize. Nationwide, civil rights groups logged unusual levels of voter intimidation complaints, receiving about 35,000 calls through a national voter complaint hotline as of Tuesday evening. Democratic Party officials, however, said they did not see systemic voter suppression efforts. Civil rights groups, who have enlisted 7,000 volunteers, said 40 percent of the calls they had received through the telephone hotline by early afternoon were from African-American and Latino voters. Complaints of voter intimidation were especially prevalent in Florida, Georgia, Ohio and Arizona with a disproportionate share coming from minority voters. We are hearing more complaints about voter intimidation than we have in presidential cycles from prior years, said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has repeatedly said the election would be rigged and called on his supporters to watch for signs of fraud in urban areas, raising fears they could clash with minority voters. Numerous studies have found that voter fraud is exceedingly rare in the United States. Absent on Tuesday were reports of the kind of hostile political displays, vandalism and violence that have cropped up regularly throughout the campaign. A polling station was locked down in Southern California after one person was killed and three wounded by gunfire but police saw no immediate indication the incident was linked to Election Day. But isolated reports of voter intimidation and harassment flooded the voter complaint hotline run by a coalition of civil rights groups throughout the day. An African-American voter called the hotline from Alabamas Shelby County to report that a white poll worker had indicated she would have to wash her hands after handling the voters photo identification card.  Shelby County lawyers persuaded the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013 to strike down a key provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act requiring states with a history of voter discrimination to get federal clearance for changes to their election laws. Clarke said many voter complaints to the hotline came from states formerly covered by that provision. Some voters in Florida reported a heavy, unexplained police presence at several polling sites around the state. A group of students in the state were told their votes would not count because their college dormitory was considered a hotel.  In Ohios Franklin County, the hotline received complaints that Somali-American voters were told they would have to vote provisionally because their addresses did not match their identification cards - and then were told that the polling site had run out of provisional ballots. In Georgias DeKalb County, a group calling itself Defenders of Democracy was pressuring voters in line to fill out sample ballots and sign pledges that they would cast the same votes on the real ballot, according to reports received by the hotline. The federal government reduced its election monitoring program in the wake of a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision that weakened federal oversight of states with a history of racial discrimination. Revised voting laws and lengthy court battles in many states also have left voters uncertain about when and where they can cast their ballot and whether they will need to present photo identification.  A Nevada judge on Tuesday rejected a request from Trump for records from a Las Vegas polling place that his campaign said had improperly remained open last week to accommodate people who were lined up to vote. The judge agreed with a county attorney who argued that election officials already preserve records.  Malfunctioning machines dominated voter complaints out of Pennsylvania, Arizona, New York, North Carolina and Virginia. Trump cited reports that polling machines were switching votes for Republican candidates to votes for Democrats as cause for concern that the election outcome might not be valid, once again warning of a rigged system. Speaking to Fox News, Trump provided no evidence to support the allegations or say where polling machines were breaking down, although there were some problems in Pennsylvania. Voters in at least four Pennsylvania counties said touch-screen voting machines were mistakenly switching votes. State officials, however, said they did not believe any ballots had been wrongly counted as a result of the machine malfunctions. Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states that relies on electronic voting machines without a paper backup that would allow officials to double-check the outcome if it is challenged. The machines can record votes incorrectly if they are not calibrated properly, a problem that is magnified as the screens degrade with age.  But ES&S, the company that makes the machines, said voters have a chance to confirm their choices before they cast their ballot, making it impossible for the machine to flip a vote from one candidate to another. Local officials test machines to make sure they are calibrated properly before each election. The Philadelphia district attorneys office, which monitors voting in the states largest city, said on Twitter it was not receiving any complaints out of the ordinary. Electronic voting rolls in Durham County, North Carolina, malfunctioned early on Tuesday, prompting the county to ask the state board of elections to extend voting hours in eight precincts until 9 p.m., an hour and a half later than they were supposed to be open. The state elections board on Tuesday evening agreed to extend voting hours in the precincts by between 20 and 60 minutes. ",politicsNews,"November 8, 2016 ",1
Voting extended in North Carolina but not in Colorado after court requests,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C./NEW YORK (Reuters) - North Carolina extended voting times in several precincts during Tuesdays  presidential election but Colorado rejected a bid to keep polls open longer after both states experienced problems with electronic voting systems. In North Carolina, advocates including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People had urged the state to extend voting time in eight Durham County precincts until 9 p.m. EST, an hour and a half past normal closing time. Instead, the state board extended voting time by an hour in two precincts and less than that in the other six. In Colorado, the Democratic Party filed a petition in the Denver County District Court to extend voting for two additional hours after service failures in the states electronic voting system in some polling places. A judge denied the request and said polls would close at 7 p.m. CST as scheduled. Colorado and North Carolina are both crucial battlegrounds in the U.S. presidential election between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. The Colorado Secretary of State office had opposed the extension of voting hours. This outage didnt stop anyone from voting. We have had two weeks of voting and everyone got a ballot, Lynn Bartels, a spokeswoman for the office, said on Twitter. She said anyone still in line when polls closed would have an opportunity to cast their ballot. The Reverend William Barber, president of the NAACP in North Carolina, told members of the State Board of Elections on a conference call Tuesday evening that their refusal to extend voting hours as long as requested by local elections officials was deeply concerning. The problem in North Carolina involved the electronic poll books used to check in voters in some precincts. At one precinct where voting was extended for 60 minutes, election officials reported there had been up to a two-hour period earlier in the day where no voting took place. Weve fought too much voter suppression in this state over and over again, Barber said. Patrick Gannon, spokesman for the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said voting was extended in just a handful of the states 2,704 precincts. The election board is made up of three Republicans and two Democrats. ",politicsNews,"November 8, 2016 ",1
Clinton campaign reached 25 percent of U.S. voters: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans voting in Tuesdays presidential election were far more likely to have been contacted by Democrat Hillary Clintons campaign than Republican Donald Trumps, according to an early reading from the Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll. Some 25 percent of American voters said someone from the Clinton campaign either called them or talked to them in person about coming out to vote, while 17 percent said the same about the Trump campaign, according to the survey of about 38,000 people who had cast a ballot. Clinton far outspent Trump during the race for the White House, setting up a sprawling campaign team that included hundreds of paid staff. Four years ago, the get-out-the-vote operations were much more competitive. On Election Day 2012, some 28 percent of voters said that they were contacted by the re-election campaign of President Barack Obama, while 25 percent said they were contacted by his Republican challenger Mitt Romneys camp.

Two-thirds of U.S. voters say they back some gun control: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two-thirds of Americans voting in Tuesdays presidential election favor moderate or strong gun control measures, according to an early reading from the Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll, up from 59 percent who said so in 2012. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has been a vocal opponent of increased limits on American gun ownership, while Democrat Hillary Clinton has advocated for an assault weapons ban and comprehensive background checks on would-be gun owners, following a slew of deadly mass shootings in the United States. The Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states and included about 38,000 people who had already voted in the presidential election. The poll reading will be updated as more poll responses are tallied and more votes counted across the country.

Trump on accepting election results: 'see how things play out',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would have to see how things play out before accepting the election results, pointing to possible irregularities as he again warned of a rigged political system. Local media reported that voters in several counties in Pennsylvania had reported that touch-screen voting machines had not been recording their ballots correctly.  Were going to see how things play out today. Hopefully theyll play out well and hopefully we wont have to worry about it, meaning hopefully well win, Trump said in a telephone interview on Fox News. I want to see everything honest. Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states that rely on electronic voting machines without a paper backup that allows officials to double-check the outcome, if challenged. The machines can record votes incorrectly if they are not calibrated properly, a problem that is magnified as the screens degrade with age. The Pennsylvania Secretary of States office did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Trumps campaign also sued election officials in Nevada, arguing they violated state law by allowing voters during early voting on Friday to line up to cast ballots at a Las Vegas polling location after the time when polls were supposed to close. A Nevada judge on Tuesday rejected Trumps request for records from the polling site. Nevada state law says voters who are in line when the polls close must be allowed to cast their ballots.

Economy tops list of worries facing American voters: Reuters/Ipsos,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The economy, terrorism and healthcare ranked as the top three concerns facing Americans casting ballots in Tuesdays presidential election, according to an early reading from the Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll. The poll of about 35,000 people found that 25 percent of voters picked the economy as the most important problem.. Another 14 percent named terrorism/terrorist attacks and 13 percent picked healthcare. By contrast, the economy was the No. 1 concern for 46 percent of American voters in 2012, according to the Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll four years ago. Almost nobody listed terrorism as a top concern in 2012, and 8 percent listed healthcare as the top worry.

"More first-time voters, late-deciders in U.S. presidential race: Reuters/Ipsos","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some 15 percent of Americans who cast a ballot on Tuesday said it was their first time voting in a presidential election, according to an early reading from the Reuters/Ipsos national Election Day poll, up from 9 percent of voters who said so in 2012. The poll of nearly 35,000 people also showed that 13 percent of voters had waited until the final week of the presidential race to make up their mind between the candidates, who include Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, up from 9 percent who said so in 2012. The Federal Bureau of Investigation announced in late October that it was looking at more emails connected to its investigation of Clintons use of a personal email server while secretary of state. FBI Director James Comey later said that the new trove of emails did not affect his earlier decision to not bring a criminal case against Clinton. ",politicsNews,"November 8, 2016 ",1

Nevada judge rejects Trump request for order over early voting,"(Reuters) - A Nevada judge on Tuesday rejected Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps request for records from a Las Vegas polling place that the campaign said had allowed people to vote after a deadline last week. Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton are in a close contest for Nevadas six electoral votes in Tuesdays election after a long and contentious campaign. Nevada is one of several states that permits early voting, and Las Vegas is viewed as a base of support for Clinton. Nevada state law says voters who are in line at 8 p.m., when the polls close, must be allowed to cast their ballots. Trumps lawsuit, filed in a Nevada state court on Monday, said election officials violated state law because they allowed people to join the line after 8 p.m. at a polling location at a Latino market during last weeks early voting period.  Trump, a New York businessman and reality TV personality who had never previously run for political office, said last month that he might not accept the outcome of the national election if he thinks it is unfair. Today may be the last time that ordinary citizens are able to stand up and say No to an overreaching, unaccountable government controlled by a ruling establishment, Charles Munoz, the Nevada state director for Trumps campaign, said in a statement after the ruling.  The suit had asked the court to order officials to preserve various records from the Cardenas Market and to segregate ballots from the voting machines at issue.  At a court hearing in Las Vegas on Tuesday, a county attorney argued that election officials already preserve records. Sturman agreed, saying she did not want to issue an order that could help reveal which candidates were chosen by particular voters.  The Trump campaign also asked for information about poll workers on duty at the market, and Sturman said she was concerned they might face threats for helping people vote. Have you watched Twitter? Do you watch any cable news shows? People can get information and harass them, the judge said. Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin said the campaign was pleased by the ruling. He described Trumps suit as a desperate response to the record turnout were seeing in Nevada and across the country. Dan Kulin, a spokesman for the Clark County Office of Public Communications, said that when early voting was taking place on Friday most if not all polling places had lines at the time they were scheduled to close.  As has been our practice for many, many years, those early voting locations continued processing voters until the lines were gone, Kulin said. ",politicsNews,"November 8, 2016 ",1

Infrastructure would be popular bipartisan step for Clinton: Hennessey,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton as president will have no policy mandate, even if elected by a wide margin, and would be wise to court Congress for an easy win on a big-dollar infrastructure bill, an economic aide to former Republican President George W. Bush said. Keith Hennessey, a former director of the White House National Economic Council and now professor at the Stanford Graduate Business School, joined the Global Markets Forum on Tuesday as Americans voted on a new president for the next four years. Clinton led Republican candidate Donald Trump, 44 percent to 39 percent, in the last Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll before Election Day. Here are excerpts from the conversation with Hennessey. Question: You see Hillary Clinton possibly scoring an outsized victory over Donald Trump in Electoral College votes. So why wouldnt that be a mandate for her policies? Answer: Im sure her team will want to claim a mandate, especially if the (Electoral College vote) is high. But this has been a near-zero policy election, so its super hard to make that case with a straight face. Q: There is wide agreement America needs to spend much more on highways, transport, airports and other fundamentals of modern society. How should a President Clinton go about securing that? A: She makes phone calls to (Congressional Republican leaders Paul) Ryan and (Mitch) McConnell. She invites our members to the White House to meet her. She engages with them, asks them whats important to them, and listens. She could do an infrastructure bill first. That has potential to be an easy bipartisan win. Q: What do you expect Clintons economic agenda to look like? A: She has taken an Obama-like position on debt: Im not prioritizing decreasing it, Im not prioritizing slowing the growth of it. But Im going to pay for all my new spending so my new proposals wont make the current policy path worse. If Clinton wins the White House, I expect at most only relative modest moves on fiscal policy (probably +/- <= 1% of GDP in the short run). Nothing like the 2009 initial Obama fiscal stimulus. If thats right, I assume the Fed stays on its current track on monetary policy. ",politicsNews,"November 8, 2016 ",1
Illinois abuse victim's lawsuit against ex-U.S. House speaker to proceed,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A sexual abuse victim will continue to try to collect $1.8 million from former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, the victims attorney said on Tuesday, after an Illinois judge denied Hasterts motion to dismiss a breach-of-contract lawsuit.  The plaintiff, identified in court documents as James Doe, claims that Hastert agreed to pay him $3.5 million as compensation for decades of pain and suffering caused by Hasterts sexual abuse. Hastert, 74, the longest-serving Republican U.S. House speaker in history, pleaded guilty last year to the crime of structuring, which involves withdrawing a large sum of money in small increments to avoid detection. Hastert has not been charged with or convicted of sex abuse due to the statute of limitations, but at his sentencing hearing in April, he admitted to sexual abuse of boys when he was a high school teacher and coach in his hometown of Yorkville, around 50 miles (80 km) southwest of Chicago.  Hastert was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison, followed by two years of probation and sex-offender treatment.  He is serving his sentence in the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minnesota. Doe filed the lawsuit in Kendall County Circuit Court in northeastern Illinois in April, claiming Hastert owes him the unpaid portion of a $3.5 million deal they verbally agreed to in 2008.  There is no public policy against an abuser agreeing to compensate his victim and the victim seeking to enforce that commitment to compensate him, Kristi Browne, Does attorney, said in a statement on Tuesday.  We will proceed now to prove our claim by seeking documents from Mr. Hastert and others and taking his deposition. Judge Robert Pilmer rejected Hasterts motion to have the case dismissed on Monday and the decision was disclosed on  Tuesday, according to court documents. The plaintiff had established a basis for a claim for contract, Pilmer wrote in his order.  Hasterts attorney did not immediately respond to request for comment.  Hasterts attorney sought dismissal because the contract was not in writing, saying it would be void because Doe broke confidentiality by speaking about it, according to court documents  Doe said he was 14 when he was molested by Hastert, a trusted family friend, high school teacher and beloved coach of the state champion wrestling team in the town of Yorkville, Illinois, according to court documents. The next hearing in the contract case is scheduled for Jan. 18. ",politicsNews,"November 8, 2016 ",1

Assange says WikiLeaks not trying to influence U.S. election,"LISBON (Reuters) - Wikileaks founder Julian Assange said on Tuesday the groups publication of material linked to Hillary Clinton was not based on any desire to influence the U.S. election. In recent months, WikiLeaks and I personally have come under enormous pressure to stop publishing what the Clinton campaign says about itself to itself, Assange said in a statement released by his legal adviser at the Web Summit, a tech conference in Lisbon. This is not due to a personal desire to influence the outcome of the election. WikiLeaks has in the past few months published thousands of emails hacked from John Podesta, Democrat candidate Clintons campaign manager.  Assange said Wikileaks had obtained no inside information about Republican candidate Donald Trump. We cannot publish what we do not have, he said. We are seen as domain experts on Clinton archives. So it is natural that Clinton sources come to us, Assange said. No-one disputes the public importance of these publications, he added. It would be unconscionable for WikiLeaks to withhold such an archive from the public during an election. Assange said WikiLeaks would continue to publish sensitive information regardless of who wins the U.S. election. The Democratic and Republican candidates have both expressed hostility towards whistleblowers, he said. Assange has been living in Ecuadors London embassy since mid-2012. A few weeks ago Ecuadors government acknowledged it had restricted his Internet access, arousing speculation it had been pressured by the United States because of the Clinton material.

Factbox: Clean energy faces vote in four state ballot initiatives,"(Reuters) - In addition to picking the next U.S. president on Tuesday, voters in four states will decide on ballot initiatives related to energy and the environment. The results of the initiatives could offer a gauge of Americans feelings about managing carbon dioxide emissions, regulating solar power, and handling local opposition to hydraulic fracturing. Here are descriptions of the various initiatives: Washington state voters will decide whether to adopt a measure to create the countrys first carbon tax. Initiative 732 would slap a $15 price tag on a ton of carbon for utilities and refiners in 2017, with the price rising gradually each year until it reaches $100. The tax would be revenue neutral: money raised would replace old revenue from sales and business taxes. Supporters say the tax would bring down emissions without burdening state residents. But the measure has brought together unlikely allies from industry groups who say it would hurt businesses bottom lines and environmental organizations like the Sierra Club who say it does not create new revenue to invest in clean energy and mass transit. Other groups argue it could hurt lower-income communities. Floridas electric utilities have sponsored a measure that could affect how the state regulates private use of solar energy. A confusingly worded Amendment 1 would alter the states constitution to protect the right to own or lease solar equipment, while also ensuring that electricity consumers who do not use solar energy are not required to subsidize the costs of back-up power and electric grid access to those who do. Supporters say it enshrines the rights of solar users, but opponents say it is a sneaky way of letting the state block net metering, in which a solar user can sell unused energy on the grid at market value. Floridians for Solar Choice say the measure would choke off the states nascent rooftop solar industry. Colorado voters will vote on a measure that would make it harder to change the states constitution by requiring broad support across all state districts for signatories to petitions and a higher percentage threshold  to be approved.  Opponents of hydraulic fracturing, an oil and gas drilling technique they say causes water pollution, claim Amendment 71 would make it harder for local communities to block fracking projects. The amendment was written and funded by oil and gas industry groups but does not directly address the controversial practice. Colorado is one of several U.S. states that has seen a surge in fracking in recent years. Scores of towns across the country, including several in Colorado, have tried to ban it. Nevada voters will decide whether to open up the states energy market to competition by giving consumers the option to decide where they buy their power. The measure comes after state regulators last year approved a rate increase for customers with rooftop solar panels, causing solar companies to lay off workers. Currently, Nevada law allows investor-owned utility companies to be monopolies in their service territories. Supported by environmentalists as well as electric carmaker Tesla, MGM Resorts and other companies, the measure would let consumers choose an energy provider and sell the solar electricity they generate themselves. Big companies that want to leave the grid can do so by paying hefty penalties to state regulators. If passed, the measure would direct the Nevada Legislature to pass legislation to create an open, competitive electricity market by mid-2023. ",politicsNews,"November 8, 2016 ",1
"Trump or Clinton? Israelis fret, but either is a likely ally","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Most of the world follows U.S. presidential elections closely, but Israel can seem particularly obsessive, endlessly assessing which candidate will better protect its interests and breaking down their every comment for policy clues. As America votes on Tuesday, a cartoon in the left-leaning Israeli newspaper Haaretz captured a sense of that fretfulness, depicting friends sitting outside a typical falafel stand and discussing in nerdy detail how the ballot will turn out.  Theres no way hed lose Utah and Arizona, and you cant count on North Carolina, one says to the other. Theyd need to win Pennsylvania and hopefully Florida, the other replies. The fact is, despite all the nervous introspection, both Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump are likely to be reliable for Israel, continuing the broad policy mix U.S. presidents have pursued since the 1980s.  Its the Palestinians who may have more to worry about. Over the past four years, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has had a fractious relationship with Barack Obama, openly campaigning against the U.S. deal on Irans nuclear program, including condemning it in a speech to Congress. But ultimately that did not stand in the way of the Obama administrations agreeing a new, $38 billion, 10-year military aid package for Israel. And while the U.S. president has criticized Israel for building more settlements on land the Palestinians seek for their own state, the censure has never gone beyond words, essentially leaving Israel free to build. Analysts say that standoff-ish approach is likely to continue whether Clinton or Trump becomes president, and there are other reasons for Israel to expect a warmer embrace from the next administration than it has had from Obama. Netanyahu has been careful not to show favoritism, meeting both candidates and saying much the same thing afterwards. Clinton, a former New York senator and U.S. secretary of state, has repeatedly emphasized that she will protect Israels interests. Trump has said he will move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a popular line that would all but enshrine Jerusalem as the countrys capital. We enjoy and appreciate the strong bipartisan support we get, said Lior Weintraub, vice-president of The Israel Project, a pro-Israel lobby group, and a former chief of staff at the Israeli embassy in Washington, DC. We believe either president will continue the tradition of the many presidents from both sides of the aisle of fostering the alliance on every front, from security to culture. While polls show most Israelis favor Clinton, Trump has a hard-core following among some national-religious Israelis, many of whom are originally from the United States. When it comes to policy, Israeli analysts see Clinton as having a better handle on the issues, and the people who are likely to handle the Middle East if she is elected are more familiar faces than those in Trumps circle.  The question is what it may mean for the Palestinians. With deep internal divisions and little prospect of a resumption of peace talks with Israel, Palestinian observers believe neither candidate has their best interests at heart. Either of them will maintain the U.S. commitment to aid Israel, the two have publicly angered the Palestinians in electoral speeches, said analyst Hani Habib. The only difference was that Trump promised to move the U.S. ambassador to Jerusalem while Clinton kept silent. Any betting on either of them is a losing bet, he said.

But even Clinton, an architect of the U.S. strategic pivot to Asia, has some work ahead of her inrebuilding trust, analysts and former officials in Asia said. With or without Trump, this marks the end of U.S. leadership, in particular, moral leadership, said a former Japanese diplomat, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the topic. I dont think its a question of Trump as an individual, but a question of the U.S. society that produced this man as the Republican candidate. Trump upended U.S. democratic traditions during his White House campaign, drawing enthusiastic crowds where people cheered his often provocative and outrageous remarks. Critics labeled him ignorant, uncouth, a racist, hypocrite, demagogue and a sexual predator, all accusations he denied.  He described a dark America, knocked to its knees by China, Mexico and the Islamic state.  Trumps harnessing of a populist backlash against immigration and global trade has challenged the ideal of benevolent American power that helped shape the global economy - and the forces of globalization - since the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Now the United States faces a rising China, long an economic force and now becoming more assertive in geopolitics -  building its military capability and ignoring an international tribunals ruling against its claims to most of the South China Sea. TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP  Asia is most worried about trade protectionism - exports make up a quarter of Asias GDP and a fifth of them go to the United States. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, championed by Barack Obama in part to increase U.S. influence in Asia, was to be an essential feature of Washingtons strategic pivot to Asia - an economic NATO.   It now looks dead in the water. Both Clinton and Trump oppose the deal, which would set up a free trade zone among 12 countries that excludes China. Former Indonesian finance minister Chatib Basri told Reuters the TPP is an important instrument for the U.S. pivot to Asia. There is some kind of a rivalry between America and China, and the way America can get into Asia is with TPP, said Basri,  now a visiting professor at Australian National University. With U.S. allies such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore among the biggest winners of an open trade regime, a more isolationist and protectionist stance will cost Washington influence in Asia.  Ironically, it would be China, the subject of many of Trumps tirades, that could emerge the big winner as uncertainty over Washingtons future commitment to Asia pushes countries into dealing more closely with Beijing. If the U.S. pulls out of TPP, that will certainly increase Chinas influence in Asia, said Kanti Bajpai, Professor of Asian Studies at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. Already, U.S. criticism of domestic issues in Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia has alienated those countries and caused them to lean towards Beijing. Pulling out of the TPP will help China geopolitically.       Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has been particularly hostile towards Washington over its criticism of his lethal anti-drugs campaign, announcing a separation from the United States during last months visit to China. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak came back from a visit to China last week with $34 billion worth of deals and an agreement to buy four Chinese naval vessels.        China has long been in Trumps sights, with promises to declare it a currency manipulator and impose punitive tariffs on imports. But any such moves could also hurt Asian exporters who ship components there for assembly and export to the United States, at a time when global trade is already weakening. Gareth Leather, senior Asia economist at Capital Economics, said the Philippines, Taiwan and South Korea were the emerging Asia economies most vulnerable to a Trump presidency. Perhaps the biggest risk to the regions economies, however, stems not from Trumps trade policies, but from his foreign policy, Leather said. Trump has created doubts over his commitment to security alliances, suggesting Japan and South Korea need to pay more for a U.S. military presence and that they should even develop their own nuclear capability to counter China and North Korea. Clinton, who was secretary of state when the Obama administration launched its Asia pivot, is expected to maintain Obamas foreign policy, with some seeing her as being more hawkish. The divisive U.S. presidential campaign has already done a lot of damage to the reputation of the United States in Asia, regardless of the election outcome, according to some analysts. The broader question is whether the United States can assert global leadership, said Jesper Koll, CEO at fund manager WisdomTree Japan.  All my Chinese friends say, We thought we would run the world in 20 years. Now its going to be in January. This is not a joke. Its the natural state of development, Koll said  ",politicsNews,"November 8, 2016 ",1
Russia to bar U.S. diplomats from monitoring its elections: RIA,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian Foreign Ministry has sent a diplomatic note to the U.S. authorities telling them that U.S. diplomats will not be allowed to conduct monitoring of future Russian elections, the RIA news agency cited a senior Russian official as saying. The move was Russias response to what it says was U.S. obstruction of Russian diplomats seeking to monitor Tuesdays U.S. presidential election for possible violations, RIA quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying.

Hate speech seeps into U.S. mainstream amid bitter campaign,"KOKOMO, Indiana (Reuters) - The lettering is crude, scrawled in black spray paint on the sidewalk in front of Karen Peters neatly kept home in the quiet, working class neighborhood where shes lived most of her life. But the contempt is clear. KKK Bitch.  The racially charged graffiti appeared in mid-October on cars, homes and telephone poles in the small city of Kokomo, Indiana. Many victims, like Peters, were African American, though some were not. Many also had lawn signs for Democratic candidatesinthis weeks presidential election, and the signs at several homes were painted over with the Ku Klux Klans notorious initials.  I think its a political thing; its getting out of hand, saidPeters, who believes the heated tenor of the presidential campaign  and especially the aggressive, nativist rhetoric of Republican candidate Donald Trump  has emboldened extremists. When you have (candidates) saying ignorant things, maybe other people think its ok to do this stuff, and thats pretty doggone sad ... It seems like our country is going backwards.  Police have no suspects in the attacks. Democrats, including the mayor and local party officials, believe they were politically motivated. Local Republicans are skeptical, suggesting the damage is the work of ignorant hooligans with no place in the party. Across the United States, the inflammatory and confrontational tone of political rhetoric is creeping into public discourse and polarizing the electorate. Its hard to quantify the impact; there is no national data that tracks politically motivated crimesor incendiary speech.  However, the percentage of voters who believe insulting political opponents is sometimes fair game has climbed over the campaign season, from 30 percent in March to 43 percent in October, according to surveys by the non-partisan Pew Research Center. A majority of voters for both parties have very unfavorable views of the other party  a first since Pew began asking the question in 1992  and trust in government is hovering near all-time lows. These indicators reflect inter-group tensions that can translate into everything from coarse discourse or low levels of aggression all the way up to extremist acts, said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University.   While much of the venom has been aimed at immigrants, African Americans and other groups typically aligned with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Republicans also have faced vitriol and hostility. Much of the debate over extremism has focused on the so-called Alt-Right, a loose-knit movement of white nationalists, anti-Semites and immigration foes that has emerged from the political shadows to align itself with the Trump campaign. Trumps vows to build a wall on the Mexican border, deport millions of illegal immigrants and scrutinize Muslims for ties to terrorism have energized the Alt-Right community.  Such rhetoric has helped legitimize the Alt-Rights concerns about an erosion of the countrys white, Christian majority, said Michael Hill, a self-described white supremacist, anti-Semite and xenophobe who heads the League of the South, a Southern Nationalist group dedicated to creating an independent white mans land. The general political climate that sort of surrounds his campaign has been very fruitful, not only for us, but for other right-wing groups, Hill said. Similarnationalistundercurrents have stirred other countries, from Russia to Japan to Britain. Last summer, as Britains debate over leaving the European Union reached a fever pitch, Jo Cox, a pro-EU lawmaker, was shot and stabbed in the street. Murder suspect Thomas Mair proclaimed death to traitors, freedom for Britain. In the United States, reports of hostile political displays, vandalism and violence are cropping up regularly.  In Mississippi, a black church was burned and painted with Vote Trump. In North Carolina, a county Republican office was set ablaze last month and a nearby building spray painted with Nazi Republicans leave town. In Ohio, a truck load of manure was dumped at a Democratic campaign office. In Utah, a man displaying Trump yard signs found KKK graffiti on his car. In Wisconsin, a fan at a college football game wore a President Barack Obama mask with a noose on his neck.  Neither the Trump nor the Clinton campaigns responded to requests for comment. Trumps positions are consistent with the Alt-Right goal of slowing the dispossession of whites, said Jared Taylor, a white nationalist whose website, American Renaissance, is a movement favorite. But the media is over-hyping his support within the Alt-Right in an attempt to discredit him, Taylor added. Trump has been criticized by both Democrats and some Republicans for being slow to condemn the more extreme elements of the political right. But when a leading KKK newspaper ran a pro-Trump story on its front page last week, his campaign immediately issued a statement rejecting the repulsive article. Taylor, Hill and other Alt-Right figures say they dont advocate or condone vandalism or violence. They dismiss the notion that their rhetoric constitutes hate speech, arguing that their vilification by the left is far more hateful.  Left-wing extremists do have a history of aggressive confrontation with people or groups seen as fascist or racist, says Heidi Beirich, of the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that monitors extremist movements. Theres usually more violence from the anti-racists than the racists, she said. The free speech provisions of the U.S. Constitutions First Amendment grant broad protections for inflammatory rhetoric. But state and federal statutes do give law enforcement agencies authority to investigate and prosecute hate crimes motivated by bias against a race, ethnicity, religion, disability or sexual orientation. A 6 percent increase in hate crimes documented last year by the California State University researchers showed relatively little underlying change in attacks against most minority groups. But crimes against Muslims rose 86 percent. Some who study and work in the political arena believe there has been a general erosion in civility that began long before the start of the current presidential race. Craig Dunn, Republican party chairman for Howard County, Indiana, which includes Kokomo, says that a minority of extreme voices are being amplified over the Internet and social media, fueling a general breakdown in civility. Local officials worry about how their community is being affected. The atmosphere is more volatile, theres more tension, saidKokomo Mayor Greg Goodnight, a Democrat. The graffiti attacks were deeply troubling, he adds. I dont remember anything like this ever happening here. Monica Fowler, 43, who had KKK sprayed on her Democratic yard signs, is struggling with the attacks. Its okay to disagree, she says. But if what youre doing is going to scare or harm another person, how dare you.

Mexicans on U.S. border fear economic catastrophe if Trump wins,"TIJUANA/NOGALES, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexicans on the U.S. border anxiously awaited the outcome of the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday, plagued by fears of economic disaster if Republican Donald Trump wins and tries to choke local industry, isolate the country and deport millions. Trumps campaign has been one of the most unpopular in living memory in Mexico, ranging from stinging verbal attacks on its migrants, threats against its trade agreements, to his repeated vows to seal off the country behind a huge border wall that he insists Mexico will pay for. Nowhere has the bad-tempered contest been felt more acutely than in the Mexican cities straddling the U.S. border, which hundreds of thousands of people cross for work every day, and acts as a bridge for $500 billion in annual bilateral trade. Trump launched his bid accusing Mexico of sending rapists and drug peddlers across the border, prompting the government to accuse him of stirring up hatred and fanning concerns on the border that racial prejudice is becoming more acceptable. The tycoon says he could scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement that took effect in Mexico, the United States and Canada in 1994, and he has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 35 percent on Mexican-made goods to help U.S. industry. Were very worried. We know what Donald Trump is looking to do, which is limit the imports, he wants to manufacture everything in the States, said Marcello Hinojosa, president in the border city of Tijuana of industry group Canacintra.  But this has been analyzed by both the United States and by Mexico and its suicide for both countries. Mexican business leaders say about 40 percent of the average Mexican factory export is made of U.S. content and argue the two manufacturing sectors are so closely intertwined that it is impossible to take steps against one without damaging the other. Trump, who polls show trailing Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in a tight race, says Mexico is killing the United States on trade. However, commerce between the two has grown much faster than their respective economies since NAFTA, World Bank and U.S. data show. Mexico sends more than 80 percent of its exports to the United States, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says roughly 6 million American jobs depend on trade with Mexico. Trump has also blasted U.S. companies for investing in Mexico, which houses billions of dollars worth of manufacturing plants, especially around Mexicos northern border. Trump blames the Mexican factories for jobs losses in the United States. If protectionist policies gain ground, prices for products and services would go up, and jobs would eventually be lost in Mexico, putting pressure on people to migrate - or exposing them to the lure of violent crime, Hinojosa said. Rarely have Mexicans expressed such strong views about U.S. presidential candidates as during the current campaign. Mexicans favor Clinton in the race by 10 to 1, according to a poll published in Mexico in late September. But the tightening of polls in the last two weeks has rattled their confidence she will win. Personally, though I think I speak for many Mexicans, I hope Trump loses, said Rodolfo Monroy, 85, a restaurant owner in the border city of Nogales, opposite Nogales, Arizona. Why? Because hes rude, because of what comes out of his mouth. He doesnt like us Mexicans, he said, with a flash of anger on his face. Were going to be in real trouble (if he wins). Wadih Kuri, Chief Executive of ABC Aluminum Solutions, a local aluminum company, recalled being labeled beaner as a Mexican studying across the border, the sort of prejudice he said Trumps campaign was encouraging again. Are we still at the same place where kids need to be ridiculed because theyre from Mexico? And thats all hes doing. So If Im nervous, Im nervous for the culture that hes inspiring, said Kuri, who now lives in San Diego. Trumps threats to deport more than 11 million undocumented migrants living in the United States, roughly half of whom are Mexican, could also put Mexican authorities under strain, said Cuauhtemoc Galindo, the mayor of Nogales, Mexico. Nor was it wise economic policy, he added. Having someone govern who feeds racism, hate, this sort of thing ... will also make a lot of Mexicans stop visiting (the United States) out of fear, out of a sense of pride, which will also hurt the U.S. economy, Galindo said. Crossing into the United States from Tijuana, one of the busiest thoroughfares in the hemisphere, construction worker Alejandro Ortiz said every aspect of his life would be affected if Trump wins - which he fears will happen. This is going to affect me whenever I cross the border, theyre going to investigate me more, just because of my color, because I speak Spanish, said Ortiz, 36, who was born in the United States but grew up in Mexico.

Democrats see FBI controversy hurting chances in U.S. Congress races,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior Democrats said on Monday their chances of winning control of the U.S. House of Representatives had been hurt by the FBIs surprise announcement last month that Hillary Clintons email practices were again figuring in a federal investigation. Voters will go to the polls on Tuesday to choose Democrat Clinton or Republican Donald Trump for president, but also to fill 34 U.S. Senate seats in the 100-chamber body and all 435 House seats. Both the House and Senate are currently controlled by Republicans. FBI Director James Comeys letter to Congress in late October that the agency would examine newly found emails that might pertain to Clintons use of a private server while she was secretary of state, had a tremendous adverse impact with our standing with independents, said Representative James Clyburn, a member of the House Democratic leadership, referring to independent voters. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, while calling Comeys action out of line, said it resulted in a spike in small campaign donations. But she added: We would be in a better place (without the letter) and in the manner he did it. Clyburns and Pelosis remarks, seen by Reuters, were delivered during a phone call House Democratic leaders had with rank-and-file members.  Continued Republican control of Congress could stymie the legislative agenda put forth by Clinton if she wins the presidency. A Trump win along with a Republican Congress could spell doom for Democratic President Barack Obamas landmark healthcare law known as Obamacare, which has been the target of a sustained attack by Republican lawmakers. If voters hand power to Democrats in either chamber, 2017 will likely bring a more moderate bent to bills that lawmakers send to the new president for signing into law. A senior Democratic aide said the October controversy, which consumed U.S. political campaigns for over a week, could reduce by at least 10 the number of House seats Democrats may be able to capture from Republicans on Election Day. Comey informed Congress on Sunday that he was standing by his July decision that no criminal charges were warranted against the Democratic presidential candidate in the emails investigation. But coming only two days before national elections, Comeys latest decision may have come too late for Democrats who were hoping for big wins on Tuesday to help them regain control of the House for the first time since 2010 and the Senate for the first time since 2014. Its terribly damaging to us, the aide said, adding that Clintons support in battleground states could be depressed, which in turn would hurt the partys House candidates. With that in mind, the aide said Democrats could end up gaining only 12 to 16 House seats on Tuesday, instead of the 30 or so needed to win back the chamber. Representative Tom Cole, a senior House Republican, said in a telephone interview he found it mystifying in how he (Comey) has interjected himself in the election on three different occasions in ways that were probably inappropriate. Cole was referring to the initial announcement in July that Clinton would not be prosecuted, the late October letter to Congress that FBI agents were again reviewing the issue and Sundays information that the agency would not change its July findings. Of Sundays good news for Clinton, the Oklahoma lawmaker said: I think it certainly takes a little steam out of the Republicans. To win control of the Senate outright, Democrats would have to score a net gain of five seats. Republicans currently hold 54 Senate seats to 44 Democratic seats and two independents who align themselves with Democrats. For much of the autumn campaign, political analysts were projecting Democrats would pick up anywhere from four to seven Senate seats. The outcome of the presidential race is expected to have a major impact on the outcome of the congressional campaigns. In recent decades, the party that wins the White House has usually fared better in congressional races too. For most of the 2016 campaign season, the Senate races have been center stage, as Democrats fielded some strong challengers to Republican incumbents. Among them are Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander, who is giving Republican Senator Roy Blunt an unexpectedly stiff challenge, and former environmental official Katie McGinty, who could unseat Republican Senator Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania.   John McCain, the Vietnam War hero and 2008 Republican presidential nominee who has served in the Senate for 30 years, appears headed to re-election in a race that has been unusually competitive for him. A possible 50-50 tie following Tuesdays elections would mean that the next vice president would cast the tie-breaking vote and determine which party controls the Senate. The Senate that will be sworn in on Jan. 3, whether it is held by Republicans or Democrats, will face a weighty decision early on: voting on a U.S. Supreme Court justice to replace the conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last February. Since that time, Senate Republicans have refused to consider Obamas nomination of federal judge Merrick Garland, arguing the next president should pick a nominee for Senate review. Other issues confronting Congress next year include illegal immigration and border security, the need to raise U.S. borrowing authority, something some conservative Republicans oppose without substantial budget cuts, and possible approval of free-trade deals with Pacific Rim countries and Europe if negotiations on the latter conclude successfully.

Democratic voter-intimidation cases falter in three U.S. states,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats fell short in three U.S. states on Monday in their legal battle to impose tighter restrictions on supporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump who plan to monitor Election Day voting for signs of fraud. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to reimpose new rules on partisan poll watchers in Ohio after an appeals court struck them down, while U.S. judges in Pennsylvania and North Carolina declined Democrats request to impose new rules that Democrats had sought.  Voter intimidation is prohibited under U.S. law, but Democrats worry that Trumps warnings of a rigged election in his battle against Democrat Hillary Clinton might inspire supporters to harass minority voters and create Election Day chaos in big cities as they search for signs of vote manipulation.  Numerous studies have found that U.S. voter fraud is exceedingly rare.  Democrats have asked U.S. courts in six battleground states to impose greater restrictions on partisan poll watchers, arguing that the Trump campaign, state Republican parties and Republican operative Roger Stone are encouraging supporters to  intimidate minority voters. Trumps campaign and Republican parties in the various states say their poll watchers are trained to bring evidence of any problems to the party and not confront voters directly. This was an attempt to intimidate Republican people engaging in lawful activity, North Carolina Republican Party executive director Dallas Woodhouse told Reuters. Stone says those working for his planned exit poll will be trained to use neutral, non-threatening language.   One day before the election, Democrats so far have failed to win any of their legal efforts. A U.S. judge denied the Democrats case in Arizona on Friday. Mondays rulings in North Carolina and Pennsylvania give Democrats little time for appeals, while the Supreme Courts Monday ruling put to rest the case filed in Ohio. The Supreme Court order, which only covers the Ohio case, included no noted dissents from the eight justices. Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a brief statement noting that Ohio law proscribes voter intimidation and citing the relevant law.  U.S. judges in Michigan and Nevada have yet to issue opinions. Democrats have waged a separate legal battle against the Republican National Committee, arguing in court that the RNC should be prevented from supporting the Trump campaigns poll-watching effort. A U.S. judge in New Jersey denied that motion on Saturday.  ",politicsNews,"November 7, 2016 ",1
New York City plans largest-ever Election Day police presence,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Both U.S. presidential candidates plan to watch Tuesday nights election returns in New York, prompting the city to stage the largest Election Day police deployment in its history, officials said on Monday. More than 5,000 police officers will be stationed around the United States largest city, and there will be extensive street closures in the neighborhoods where Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump plan to watch returns come in - and where one will likely declare victory before hundreds of cheering supporters. We know that the eyes of the world will be on New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio told a news conference on Monday. We have an obligation, not only to the people in the city but to this country, to make sure that tomorrow, all through the day and particularly tomorrow night, go smoothly and goes well. Clinton plans to hold her election night event at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center near the Hudson River, while Trumps will be at a large Hilton Hotel in Midtown Manhattan.     The citys heightened security efforts come after federal authorities received unspecific threats of attacks by the al Qaeda militant group on New York City, Texas and Virginia around Election Day.  Tuesday will be the first time that both major party candidates have spent Election Day in New York City since 1944, when New York states Republican governor, Thomas Dewey, tried to unseat Democrat and New Yorker Franklin Roosevelt, who went on to win an unprecedented fourth term in office. The New York City Police Department plans to station uniformed officers, including some with automatic weapons and explosives-detection equipment, across Manhattan and the citys 1,205 polling stations. All of the citys bomb-sniffing police dogs will be deployed, as well as special roving teams of officers, police said. The candidates will also be protected by the U.S. Secret Service, which has provided security for both candidates during the presidential campaign and will work with the city police department on Tuesday. This is by far the largest election detail that the NYPD has ever had, said Carlos Gomez, the chief of department. Its comparable to the detail size we have here on New Years Eve and last year when Pope Francis visited. Trump has longstanding ties to New York City, where he was born and followed in his fathers footsteps as a real estate developer.  Clinton moved to the suburb of Chappaqua, New York, following President Bill Clintons eight years in the White House, and served as a U.S. senator from the state from 2001 through 2008.

Three U.S. senators ask Mylan for EpiPen military reimbursements,"(Reuters) - Three members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, ahead of a planned hearing late this month, said Mylan NV appears to have greatly overcharged the military for its lifesaving allergy treatment EpiPen and asked the pharmaceutical company when it plans to reimburse the Department of Defense. The reimbursement demand came in a letter on Monday to Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, from Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, and committee members Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, both Democrats. We are alarmed that Mylan may have overcharged our military for this life-saving drug, the Senators wrote. They said Mylan for years may have knowingly misclassified EpiPen as a generic product in order to avoid higher rebates the company would have had to pay state and federal Medicaid programs had it been classified as a branded product. The Medicaid rebate for a generic is 13 percent compared with a minimum of 23.1 percent for a branded medicine. Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin declined to comment on the letter, or its demands. The drug company has come under fire from consumers and politicians in recent months for raising the U.S. list price on a pack of two EpiPen injectors nearly six-fold to $600 since 2008. Lawmakers, including Grassley, have called for investigations into Mylans pricing, helping put the product in the spotlight amid a larger debate over big drug price increases in the United States.  Pentagon spending on EpiPen jumped to $57 million over the past year from $9 million in 2008, an increase driven by volume and by hefty price hikes that had a bigger bite on prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies, Reuters reported on Oct. 28, citing previously unreported data.   The Pentagon gets a government discount on EpiPens dispensed at military treatment facilities and by mail order. But nearly half of its spending was at retail pharmacies where it most recently paid an average of $509 for EpiPen and $528 for EpiPen Jr two-packs - three times higher than its discounted rate, according to the data. The Senate Judiciary Committee is slated to hold a hearing  Nov. 30 on EpiPen pricing and related matters.    ",politicsNews,"November 7, 2016 ",1
U.S. top court may curb presidential appointment powers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Supreme Court justices, hearing a dispute over presidential powers a day before the U.S. election, indicated on Monday they might curb a presidents authority to staff top administration posts in a case involving the National Labor Relations Board. The eight justices heard an hour-long argument in a 2014 legal challenge brought by Arizona-based private ambulance company SW General Inc to President Barack Obamas temporary appointment of Lafe Solomon in 2011 as NLRB general counsel. Obama also nominated Solomon to fill the position permanently, a move that required U.S. Senate approval. The company, a subsidiary of Envision Healthcare Holdings Inc, challenged Solomons appointment after the labor board found SW General had committed an unfair labor practice by discontinuing bonus payments for long-term employees. If SW General wins, the NLRB order would be thrown out because of Solomons participation. Solomon filled in for former general counsel Ronald Meisburg, who resigned in 2010. Obama withdrew Solomons nomination after it stalled for more than two years. The Senate ultimately confirmed Richard Griffin to the post in 2013. SW General argued that Solomon should not have continued to fill the position on a temporary or acting basis pending Senate confirmation. In a 2015 ruling against the administration, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said a 1998 federal law bars officials from serving in an acting role while awaiting Senate confirmation unless they were previously the first assistant to that post. The administration contends others who fill posts temporarily can also be nominated, including those previously confirmed by the Senate to another position. The Supreme Court in 2014 limited presidential powers in another case involving the NLRB, ruling that three 2013 appointments Obama made to the board while Congress was in recess were invalid. Justice Anthony Kennedy questioned whether new constraints on presidential appointment power would make as much of a practical difference as Obamas administration claims, calling the system  quite capable of accommodating a ruling in favoring SW General. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said concerns about past government actions taken by acting officials being challenged retroactively were overblown. The administration said 100 appointments over the past 18 years would have been invalid under the approach sought by the company, including several in sensitive national security jobs. Justice Elena Kagan said with the recent history of partisan bickering over appointments, we would have heard about it if members of Congress had objected in the manner the company does. The outcome of the case could assume added importance if the next president faces protracted nomination battles and opts to appoint officials on a temporary basis. A ruling is due by the end of June.

"Janet Reno, first U.S. woman attorney general, dies at 78","(Reuters) - Blunt-spoken Janet Reno, who served eight years as the first woman U.S. attorney general and authorized the deadly 1993 raid on the Branch Davidian cult compound in Texas just weeks into the job, died on Monday at age 78. Reno died in Miami of Parkinsons disease complications, according to her goddaughter, Gabrielle DAlemberte. Reno was diagnosed with the progressive central nervous system disorder in 1995. Reno served as the United States top law enforcement official during Democrat Bill Clintons presidency from 1993 to 2001, becoming the longest-tenured attorney general of the 20th century. She authorized the seizure by federal agents in 2000 of 6-year-old Cuban shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez from relatives in Miami, as well as the governments huge antitrust case against Microsoft Corp in 1998. Janet Reno was an American original, a public servant whose intellect, integrity and fierce commitment to justice helped shape our nations legal landscape, President Barack Obama said in a statement. Clinton said on Monday, As attorney general for all eight years of my presidency, Janet worked tirelessly to make our communities safer, protect the vulnerable, and to strike the right balance between seeking justice and avoiding abuse of power. The former Miami prosecutor, picked by Clinton only after his first two choices for the job ran into trouble, exhibited an independent streak and a brusque manner that often upset the White House. Reno weathered White House complaints that she was not a team player and that she sought too many special prosecutors to investigate cases, including the Whitewater affair involving the finances of the president and first lady Hillary Clinton.  Reno was only 38 days into the attorney generals job when she approved the April 19, 1993, FBI raid that led to the deaths of about 80 people, including many children, at the Branch Davidian cult compound in Waco, Texas. Federal agents had earlier tried to serve a warrant on the cults leader, David Koresh, who said he was the Messiah, for stockpiling weapons. Four agents and six cult members were killed in an ensuing shootout, leading to a 51-day standoff. With negotiations at an impasse, Reno gave the go-ahead for the raid after hearing reports of child abuse in the compound. The raid on the heavily armed cultists ended in an inferno that engulfed the site. I made the decision. Im accountable. The buck stops with me, a grim-looking Reno told a news conference later. Reno took a personal interest in the political tussle over Elian Gonzalez, the young shipwreck survivor whose mother drowned fleeing Cuba.  Reno met the boy and his Miami relatives, who battled to keep him from returning to communist Cuba, and his father and grandmothers, who wanted to raise Gonzalez in his homeland. Reno argued that Elian belonged with his father and acted after the Miami relatives defied a U.S. government order to hand him over. She authorized armed agents to take the boy from his relatives home in a predawn raid in April 2000 and reunite him with his father, who took him back to Cuba. The raid infuriated members of Miamis Cuban exile community, who called her a witch and a lackey of Cuban President Fidel Castro. In 1998, Renos Justice Department brought a huge antitrust case against Microsoft. Two years later, a federal judge ordered the breakup of the software giant because it had ignored his ruling that it had used unlawful monopolistic practices. The case was settled in 2001 by the administration of President George W. Bush, Clintons Republican successor, in terms seen as favorable to Microsoft. Reno appeared with Clinton after the 1995 truck bombing of  the Oklahoma City federal building that killed 168 people, and vowed to seek the death penalty for the perpetrators. Convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh in 2001 become the first federal prisoner executed since 1963. McVeigh said he carried out the attack to punish the U.S. government for the Waco cult raid and another raid in Idaho. Some comedians made fun of Reno during her time in office, lampooning her appearance and 6-foot-2 height (1.88-meter), among them Will Ferrell who impersonated her on Saturday Night Live.  Shortly after leaving office, she appeared on the show next to Ferrell, both wearing identical outfits, in a sketch called Janet Renos Dance Party. Reno was in the job longer than anyone except William Wirt, who held it from November 1817 until March 1829. Reno ran for governor in Florida in 2002, but lost in the Democratic primary. Parkinsons disease caused trembling in her arms. All it does is shake, and you get used to it shaking after a while, she told a TV interviewer. Reno was born on July 21, 1938, in Miami to parents who were newspaper reporters. She attended public schools in Miami and earned a chemistry degree at Cornell University in 1960. She received her law degree from Harvard three years later, and worked as a lawyer in Miami. ",politicsNews,"November 7, 2016 ",1
Obama continues to back FBI Director Comey: White House,"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - President Barack Obama remains confident in FBI Director James Comeys ability to the lead the agency in the aftermath of the probe of Democrat Hillary Clintons use of a private email server, the White House said on Monday. The president views Director Comey as a man of integrity, a man of principle, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters in a briefing. The presidents views of him have not changed. ... He continues to have confidence in his ability to run the FBI.  Comey has faced intense criticism for his decision to inform Congress days before Tuesdays presidential election about newly discovered emails that might pertain to the investigation of Clintons use of a private server while secretary of state. He roiled the race again on Sunday when he told lawmakers that investigators had completed their review of the additional emails and there was no change to the Federal Bureau of Investigations July finding that there was no criminal wrongdoing in Clintons use of the server. The White House, which has attempted to remain neutral on Comeys handling of the probe, said on Monday it had not been given any advance notice of the announcement on Sunday. The president is entirely confident that Director Comey is not using his authority to advantage a particular political candidate or particular party, Earnest said.

Justice Department to monitor Tuesday's election in 28 states,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Personnel from the U.S. Justice Departments civil rights division will be deployed to polling sites in 28 states to monitor Tuesdays election, five more than it monitored in the 2012 election, the department said on Monday. Most of those states will receive Justice Department staff who have no statutory authority to access polling sites as a result of a 2013 Supreme Court decision that struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act, curtailing the departments ability to deploy election observers with unfettered access to the polls. More than 500 Justice Department personnel will be deployed on Tuesday, compared to more than 780 personnel the department dispatched during the 2012 general election. A Justice Department spokesman declined to say how many of Tuesdays personnel will be full-access observers.       Tuesdays hotly contested election, including the presidential race pitting Republican Donald Trump against Democrat Hillary Clinton, will be the first in decades in which the Justice Department can only send full-access observers to states where a federal court ruling has authorized it. On the campaign trail, Trump has warned the election may be rigged and has called on supporters to keep an eye on voting activity for possible signs of fraud in large cities. Numerous studies have found that U.S. voter fraud is exceedingly rare.  As always, our personnel will perform these duties impartially, with one goal in mind: to see to it that every eligible voter can participate in our elections to the full extent that federal law provides, said Attorney General Loretta Lynch in a statement.     Courts have granted the Justice Department permission to deploy full-access observers in five states: Alaska, California, Louisiana, New York, and Alabama. But the court order for Alabama only pertains to municipal elections and it is not on the list of states where the Justice Department is deploying poll watchers this year.  The Justice Department staff who are deployed to the other 24 states on Tuesday will be election monitors, who must rely on local and state authorities to grant them access to polling locations. In most cases, voters on the ground will see very little practical difference between monitors and observers, said Vanita Gupta, the head of the departments civil rights division, in a statement.

Facebook partners with news outlets for Election Day live video blitz,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facebook said on Monday it would partner with 50 broadcast stations, print and online publications for an Election Day live video blitz, as the social media company aims to build on the momentum of its popular Facebook Live video streaming service.  The move comes as Facebook and rival sites like Twitter increasingly embrace live video to draw in users and boost traffic. Facebook warned last week that revenue growth would slow this quarter because of ad load, or the number of ads that Facebook can put in front of customers without alienating them, offsetting strong earnings that handily beat Wall Street estimates. Each outlet partnering with Facebook will publish a 15-minute live video centered on the presidential election in one of the 50 states. The content will be featured on Facebooks Election 2016 site on Tuesday and include the hashtag #50states. While Facebook is not selling ads on the Election Day livestreams, it could generate more visits to the site, bolstering its reputation as a destination for live news and pushing back against Twitter, where users often live-tweet major events. Asked whether the Facebook Live initiative was a response to the popularity of live-tweeting events among social media users, Jason White, manager of U.S. news media partnerships at Facebook, said Facebook Live was something that works really well on our platform. I think for us we really wanted to give the news media and especially local (outlets) something to raly around on Election day, said White, regarding the 50 States project.  He said the company is exploring the possibility of including advertising breaks in live video in the future but said that no specific plans had been made yet. Frank Mungeam, vice president of digital content for broadcast and digital media firm TEGNA, told Reuters that six of his companys local broadcast stations, one each from Colorado, Washington state, Minnesota, Idaho, Maine and South Carolina, were participating. Mungeam, who said Facebook was not paying his company for the content, added: Facebooks platform offers an extended reach. Twitter said last week its government-focused handle, @gov, would provide election information to users via direct message, while Snapchat on Sunday featured a photo filter encouraging people to vote. Facebook launched Facebook Live for selected public figures in 2015 and made it available to all users in April 2016, allowing members to broadcast video live from their smartphones. Social media sites have been seizing on live video content to attract users. In September, Twitter broadcast its first National Football League game, attracting generally positive feedback. It launched its livestreaming app, Periscope, in March 2015. Asked about live-streaming video and social media in general, Stefan Sideris, director of global social media operations at Amobee, a digital marketing technology company, said he saw a clear trend toward bigger companies adopting the technology. Brands and media companies areinterested in connecting and engaging with consumers to bring the conversation together over live video, Sideris said. Live will ultimately drive a lot of social activity. ",politicsNews,"November 7, 2016 ",1
Monmouth poll: 6-point Clinton lead over Trump day before U.S. election,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton led Republican Donald Trump by 6 percentage points among likely U.S. voters in a Monmouth University poll released on Monday, a day before the U.S. presidential election. The survey of 802 registered voters found 50 percent backed Clinton while 44 percent supported Trump, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points, the university said in a statement.

Clinton's pantsuits inspire flashmob video,"(Reuters) - Hillary Clintons signature colorful pantsuits got a shout-out from dozens of women who staged a flashmob in support of the Democratic presidential candidate in Washington D.C. Dressed in red, black, blue and pink pantsuits, the group danced on Friday to Salute by British girl band Little Mix for a YouTube video organized by Clinton supporters called DC Power Pantsuit Flashmob. Organizer Jamie Poslosky said she came up with the idea because she was feeling depressed by the bitter rhetoric that has marked the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign between Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump. I thought rather than sit and stew and be despondent I would try to find something really empowering and positive to do and clearly, as was shown here, theres a real energy and desire by a lot of people to just be proud and loud and supportive, Poslosky said. Clinton, a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady who is hoping to become the first woman elected to the White House, has faced frequent scrutiny of her appearance during her years in the public eye including criticism of her hair style. Pantsuits have become her trademark in recent years. Opinion polls show Clinton and Trump in a close race ahead of Tuesdays election.  ",politicsNews,"November 7, 2016 ",1

"Fending off foes, Clinton blazes a trail with White House in sight","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton has one of the strongest resumes of anyone ever to run for U.S. president, with stints as first lady, senator and secretary of state, but she is also a polarizing figure and a Washington insider with decades of political baggage. Should Democrat Clinton, 69, defeat Republican Donald Trump, 70, in Tuesdays election, she would become the first woman elected U.S. president, having already been the only first lady to win elected office and the first woman nominated for president by a major U.S. party. Clinton fell short in her first presidential bid in 2008, losing her partys nomination to Barack Obama. Her time on the American political scene has come during an era of intense partisanship and gaping divisions in U.S. society. Americans hold dramatically differing views of Clinton. Clintons admirers consider her a tough, capable and sometimes inspirational leader who has endured unrelenting efforts by political enemies to chop her down. Her detractors consider her an unscrupulous and power-hungry opportunist. Clinton entered the 2016 race as her partys odds-on favorite, but was an establishment figure, the ultimate insider with decades of political baggage, at a time when voters seemed enamored with outsiders. She staved off an unexpectedly stiff challenge from U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, to claim the Democratic nomination in July. For decades Clinton has battled conservatives and Republican adversaries and weathered controversies including her husband Bill Clintons infidelity, a failed Republican effort to remove him from office, investigations into past business dealings and her use of a private email server as secretary of state. She famously complained in 1998 during her husbands presidency about a vast right-wing conspiracy. Many Democrats back her for championing women's rights at home and abroad, social justice and access to healthcare, but opinion polls show a majority of U.S. voters do not trust her. [polling.reuters.com/#!poll/TM752Y15_2] Against Trump, she portrayed her candidacy as a bulwark against a unique threat that she said the real estate developer posed to American democracy. As President Obamas secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, she grappled with civil wars in Syria and Libya, Irans nuclear program, Chinas growing clout, Russian assertiveness, ending the Iraq war, winding down the Afghanistan war, and an unsuccessful bid to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Clinton was already running for president when, during a testy 11-hour congressional hearing in October 2015, she deflected Republican criticism of her handling of a 2012 attack by militants in Benghazi, Libya in which the U.S. ambassador died. That hearing and another in January 2013 while she was still secretary of state focused on allegations of State Department security lapses related to the attack. A mistrust of rivals and the media has long prompted Clinton to keep her guard up. The truth is, through all these years of public service, the service part has always come easier to me than the public part, Clinton said in accepting the 2016 Democratic nomination. I get it that some people just dont know what to make of me. At the same convention, Obama cited her years of experience and said, There has never been a man or woman, not me, not Bill - nobody more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States. Republicans have accused Clinton of breaking the law while corresponding through a private email server as secretary of state. In July, FBI Director James Comey called Clinton extremely careless in her handling of classified information by email, but Obamas Justice Department accepted his recommendation not to bring criminal charges. If I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently, Clinton said during a Sept. 26 debate with Trump, referring to her use of the private server as a mistake for which she took responsibility. The controversy flared again on Oct. 28 when Comey told U.S. lawmakers the FBI was investigating a new trove of emails as part of its probe, but said their significance was unclear. Trump seized on the probe into Clintons email, deriding her as Crooked Hillary, saying he would seek to put her behind bars if elected and encouraging his supporters to chant lock her up. Clinton portrayed Trump as a racist hate-monger, a sexist and a tax-dodger enamored with Russian President Vladimir Putin and unfit to serve as president and commander in chief. Such a nasty woman, Trump retorted during their Oct. 19 debate when she suggested he would try to get out of paying the higher taxes she advocates for the wealthy. Born in Chicago on Oct. 26, 1947, Hillary Rodham Clinton was  the eldest of three children of a small-business owner father she called a rock-ribbed, up-by-your-bootstraps, conservative Republican and a mother who was a closet Democrat. She said she inherited her fathers distinctive laugh - she called it a big rolling guffaw - and Americans have heard it frequently.  She attended public schools, then enrolled in 1965 at all-female Wellesley College in Massachusetts, where she headed the Young Republicans Club.  In a Wellesley commencement address, she seized the spotlight by starting her speech with extemporaneous remarks challenging comments made by the preceding speaker, a U.S. senator. Her political views changed during the 1960s civil rights struggles and Vietnam War escalation. She attended the 1968 Republican convention that nominated Richard Nixon, but soon became a Democrat. At Yale Law School, she met a similarly ambitious fellow student from Arkansas, Bill Clinton, and they became a couple. She moved to Washington to work for a congressional panel in the impeachment drive against Nixon, who resigned as president in 1974 during the Watergate scandal. She moved to Arkansas to be with Bill, married him in 1975, and was hired by a top law firm. He jumped into politics, eventually being elected governor, at age 32, in 1978. She gave birth to the couples only child, daughter Chelsea, in 1980. As Arkansas first lady, she was a high-powered lawyer in the capital Little Rock and a Wal-Mart corporate board member. Most Americans were introduced to her during her husbands bid for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Bill Clinton said voters would get two for the price of one if they elected him. She unapologetically said she was not a woman who stayed home and baked cookies. After a woman named Gennifer Flowers accused Bill Clinton during the campaign of a sexual affair, Hillary Clinton appeared on TV with her husband and referred to singer Tammy Wynettes song, Stand by Your Man. You know, Im not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette, she said, adding that she loved and respected her husband. And you know, if thats not enough for people, then heck, dont vote for him, she added.  Conservative critics painted her as a radical feminist and a threat to traditional family values. Bill Clinton defeated incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush in November 1992. As first lady from 1993 to 2001, she was unusually exertive, diving into policy matters unlike many of her predecessors. Critics assailed her failed effort to win congressional passage of healthcare reform, deriding it as Hillarycare. At a 1995 U.N. conference in China on women, she declared that human rights are womens rights and womens rights are human rights.  She and her husband faced a long investigation into past business dealings but ultimately no criminal charges were brought. A real estate venture known as Whitewater faced scrutiny, spawning an independent counsel investigation that later encompassed Bill Clintons sexual relationship with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster, a figure in the Whitewater controversy and a close friend of the Clintons from Arkansas, was found dead of a gunshot in 1993. His death was ruled a suicide. In a 2003 memoir, Hillary Clinton blasted conspiracy theorists and investigators trying to prove that Vince was murdered to cover up what he knew about Whitewater.  In 2000, the independent counsel investigation concluded there was insufficient evidence to show the Clintons had been involved in any criminal behavior related to Whitewater. In December 1998, the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to impeach a president for only the second time in U.S. history, charging Bill Clinton with high crimes and misdemeanors for allegedly lying under oath and obstructing justice to cover up his relationship with Lewinsky. The Republican-led Senate acquitted Clinton in February 1999. Hillary Clinton called the impeachment an abuse of power by Republicans with a Soviet-style show trial and condemned what she called an attempted congressional coup detat. She also said she wanted to wring Bills neck for the affair and upbraided him privately. Ultimately, she said, she decided she still loved him and remained after they went through counseling. All I know is that no one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does, she wrote in her 2003 book Living History. Hillary Clinton soon launched her own bid for elected office. She bought a house in the town of Chappaqua to officially become a New York resident. She won election as a U.S. senator the same month her husband left office in January 2001. She served until 2009. She entered the race for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination as the front-runner, but then-senator Obama won the partys nomination and beat Republican John McCain to become the first black president. In 2016, Obama campaigned vigorously for her against Trump. What sets Hillary apart is that through it all, she just keeps on going, and she doesnt stop caring, and she doesnt stop trying. And she never stops fighting for us, even if we havent always appreciated it, Obama told a September rally. ",politicsNews,"November 6, 2016 ",1

Trump says he would not admit refugees without community support,"STERLING HEIGHTS, Mich. (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told crowds in Michigan and Minnesota on Sunday his administration would not admit refugees without local support, using appearances in states with growing Muslim communities to criticize Democrat Hillary Clintons support for accepting people fleeing Syria. Trump said in Minneapolis that people there had already seen the results of faulty vetting with Minnesotas community of Somali Muslims. He said what was happening in Michigan, home to several cities with Muslim communities, was disgraceful. Trump held rallies in both states as part of his final push toward Tuesdays presidential election, even though Michigan and Minnesota traditionally support Democrats in White House races. Here in Michigan, youve seen firsthand the problems caused with the refugee program ... it puts your security at risk and it puts enormous pressure on your schools and your community resources, Trump told an outdoor rally in Sterling Heights. A Trump administration will not admit any refugees without the support of the local community. Muslim American groups have criticized Trump for comments such as endorsing police profiling as an anti-terrorism tactic. He initially called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, later changing it to bar immigration from what he called terror-prone regions until extensive vetting measures were in place.  Clinton has praised Democratic President Barack Obamas plan to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees in 2016 and said the United States could do more. Trump said her plan to admit refugees from Syria would import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism. His vow to block people fleeing Islamic State violence in Syria and instead form safe zones in the Middle East has been a theme of his campaign. On Sunday, Trump framed the issue in local terms. What was happening in Minnesota was a disaster, he told the crowd at a Minneapolis airplane hangar. Some of them, theyre joining ISIS, theyre spreading their extremist views all over the country, he said of refugees there, citing a September stabbing attack in St. Cloud, Minnesota, as justification for his proposals. Somalis began arriving in Minnesota in the late 1980s and early 1990s, fleeing a civil war in their Horn of Africa nation. There are about 39,000 living in the state, according to U.S. census data from 2014. Somali-Americans have expressed concern about how they are perceived after a trial earlier this year where three young men from the community were convicted of trying to join Islamic State.

"As election looms, Trump says he is 'last chance,' Clinton sees 'moment of reckoning'","MANCHESTER, N.H./STERLING HEIGHTS, MICHIGAN (Reuters) - As Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton criss-crossed the United States on Sunday in a final, frenzied burst of campaigning, the Republican said he was the last chance to fix a broken country while his Democratic rival said a moment of reckoning had arrived. The two candidates in Tuesdays presidential election presented starkly different views of the nation and evoked similarly disparate reactions from crowds gathered to hear them speak. In Iowa, Trump said he was the last chance to fix immigration and trade. Outside Minneapolis, he said the Somali refugee population there was a disaster. Supporters near Pittsburgh booed a song by musician Bruce Springsteen, who is set to campaign with Clinton on Monday night.  Chants of lock her up came in waves even as news broke that the FBI again said Clinton should not face prosecution for her email practices while secretary of state. As rocker and guitarist Ted Nugent warmed up a Trump rally in a Detroit suburb, he grabbed his crotch. Ive got your blue state right here, Nugent said, referring to states that typically vote for Democratic candidates, including Michigan. By the way, my language is much, much cleaner, as you know, than Jay Z, Trump said at the same event.  Trump has criticized crude language in a Friday night concert that rapper Jay Z and his wife, Beyonce, held for Clinton in Cleveland. The most filthy language youve ever heard, Trump said at the Minnesota rally. One of his supporters there wore a t-shirt that said: Rope. Tree. Journalist. Some Assembly Required. Clinton began and ended Sunday with renditions of America the Beautiful. The first was at a black church in Philadelphia, the second time performed by folk singer James Taylor at a get-out-the-vote rally in New Hampshire, where the crowd swayed and sang along, linking arms. Clinton walked onto the stage with Khizr Khan, whose son was a slain Muslim U.S. soldier. Khan addressed the Democratic National Convention in July, criticizing Trumps proposal to ban Muslims from entering the country and offering to loan him a U.S. Constitution. Some in Manchester held up miniature Constitutions in tribute. In a race that has been marked by ugly suspicion and insults and attacks of all kinds against immigrants, Muslims and so many others, Mr. Khan, I think, reminded all of us that we are Americans, Clinton said. Clinton called Tuesday a crossroads election and a moment of reckoning, echoing her earlier statements at a Cleveland rally with Cavaliers player LeBron James. Our core values as Americans are being tested, she said. ",politicsNews,"November 7, 2016 ",1
Betting sites see record wagering on U.S. presidential election,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The raucous, passionate and unpredictable 2016 U.S. presidential election is on track to notch another distinction: the most wagered-upon political event ever. With many opinion polls showing a tight race just one day before Tuesdays election, record numbers of bettors are pouring millions into online platforms from Ireland to Iowa in the hope of capturing a financial windfall from a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump.  UK-based internet betting exchange Betfair said on Sunday its Next President market was set to become the most traded it had ever seen and expected to surpass even Brexit, the contentious UK referendum to leave the European Union. By Sunday, roughly $130 million had been traded on who will become the next U.S. president, compared with $159 million on the Brexit referendum, Betfair spokeswoman Naomi Totten said. The amount bet so far on the 2016 contest dwarfs the roughly $50 million laid on the 2012 race. We think it is because (of) how raw the Brexit (vote) is in peoples minds - theyre not convinced yet that its a done deal, Totten said. Most polls leading into Britains June 23 referendum predicted Britons would choose to remain in the EU. Instead, they voted to leave by a 52 percent to 48 percent margin. Betfairs Next President market was by far the largest of more than 70 markets on the site related to the U.S. election. As of Friday, some $140 million has been put into play on markets ranging from who will win the popular vote to how many states each party will carry. On Irelands Paddy Power, which merged with Betfair earlier this year, the U.S. presidential election is definitely on course to be the biggest political event, said spokesman Filim Mac An Iomaire. The site has had about $4.38 million bet on the race so far. For Paddy Power, sporting events remain the sites bread and butter, with politics more of a niche market, Mac An Iomaire said. Nonetheless, he expects the 2016 race to be among the top 10-most-traded events on the site. Even people with no knowledge of politics know who Trump is, said Mac An Iomaire said, explaining the runaway popularity of the U.S. election in betting markets. Trump is such a huge celebrity. Ladbrokes, a UK-based gambling company, said about 5 million pounds, or a little over $6 million, had been bet on the 2016 presidential election since its markets on the race opened four years ago. A Ladbrokes spokesman said that amount was at least double the amount wagered on the 2012 election. The three sites all reported an 83 percent probability of a Clinton victory on Tuesday. Her probability shot up a few percentage points on Sunday after the FBI stood by its earlier recommendation that no criminal charges were warranted against Clinton in her use of a private email server.  The vast majority of big-dollar political betting occurs outside America. Wagering on elections in the United States is limited by law to relatively small trading platforms connected to universities, which use data from the markets for academic research. Still, the sites are abuzz with activity as the election nears, albeit in small amounts.  On PredictIt, launched in 2014 and jointly run by Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, and Washington, D.C.-based political consulting firm Aristotle International Inc, the five most-active markets all related to the presidential election. PredictIt is not legally permitted to disclose the amount of money traded, but its top three markets have all reached the maximum number of participants. Trading on the older Iowa Electronic Markets, launched by the University of Iowa in 1988, has also been brisk, although a spokeswoman said she could not say if 2016 was seeing substantially more volume than in 2012, when President Barack Obama won re-election against Republican Mitt Romney. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Clinton with a 5 percentage point lead over Trump in the national survey - 44 percent to 39 percent - while races in the swing states of Florida, North Carolina had shifted from Clintons control to being too close to call. The PredictIt market gave Clinton an 81 percent probability of winning the White House. IEMs Winner Takes All market showed her with a 71 percent chance . Betfair said on Friday that Trump was emerging as the clear favorite among one group of players in particular - Brexit backers. Two-thirds of its customers who had supported a Brexit outcome were also backing Trump on Betfair. Paul Krishnamurty, a professional gambler for 15 years who works as an analyst at Betfair and a columnist at Politico, is not one of them. He told Reuters he stood to lose $28,000 if Trump wins on Tuesday. Krishnamurty, who said he had earned roughly half a million dollars during his betting career, has laid money on several election-related markets this year. He took a winning position on Trumps selection of Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate and bet against Jeb Bush during the Republican nominating contests.  He said he believed Clinton would likely to win both North Carolina and Florida and that a Trump victory was unlikely. I personally believe she will win in a landslide, Krishnamurty said.

FBI clears Clinton in email review two days before election,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI said on Sunday it stood by its earlier finding that no criminal charges were warranted against Democrat Hillary Clinton for using a private email server for government work, lifting a cloud over her presidential campaign two days before the U.S. election. FBI Director James Comey made the announcement in a letter to Congress, saying the agency had worked around the clock to complete its review of newly discovered emails and found no reason to change its July finding. During that process, we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state, Comey said. Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July. A law enforcement source told Reuters the decision closed the FBI probe of Clintons email practices.  Comey informed Congress of the newly discovered emails more than a week ago, throwing the race for the White House into turmoil and helping to erode Clintons lead over Republican candidate Donald Trump in the final stretch before Tuesdays vote. Were glad this issue is resolved but for the record, this could easily have been learned before 1st letter was sent, Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon wrote on Twitter. At a rally in Michigan, Trump questioned the thoroughness of the FBI review and said he was confident the issue would not go away. The investigation will go on, the rank-and-file special agents wont let her get away with her terrible crimes, he told supporters in Sterling Heights, Michigan. Clinton did not mention the FBI email decision during campaign appearances in Ohio and New Hampshire. U.S. stock index futures rose more than 1 percent after the FBI announcement, suggesting Wall Street was poised to end its longest skid in more than three decades. The U.S. dollar also jumped in Asian trading against the yen, euro and Swiss franc. U.S. Treasury futures dropped and Tokyos Nikkei share average opened up 1.31 percent. Global financial markets slipped last week as opinion polls showed the presidential race tightening. The latest emails were discovered as part of a separate probe of former Democratic U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Weiner is the target of an FBI investigation into illicit text messages he allegedly sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. Federal investigators got a warrant to examine the emails to see if they were related to the probe into Clintons private server. Democrats reacted angrily to Comeys intrusion into the race and demanded quick action in examining the emails. I am very grateful to the professionals at the FBI for doing an extraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short period of time, Comey said on Sunday. But Democrats did not let Comey and the FBI off the hook. U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said Sundays announcement made Comeys earlier letter even more troubling and called for the Justice Department to review its procedures to prevent similar actions to influence future elections. By confirming that the new emails were meaningless, todays letter underscores the irresponsibility of Director Comeys original letter, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said. Republicans kept up their criticism of Clinton despite Comeys announcement. She simply believes shes above the law and always plays by her own rules, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement, arguing that Clintons use of a private email server compromised our national security. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Preibus said that while the probe had not led to criminal charges, it produced evidence that Clinton broke the law and repeatedly lied to the American people about her reckless conduct. News of the renewed probe had appeared to fuel a recent slide in Clintons poll numbers. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Clinton with a 5 percentage point lead over the New York businessman nationally - 44 percent to 39 percent support - while races in the swing states of Florida and North Carolina shifted from favoring Clinton to being too close to call. The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project estimates that Clinton has a 90 percent chance of winning the election. ",politicsNews,"November 6, 2016 ",1
Georgia senators will consider Clinton high court nominees: report,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Georgias two Republican senators broke with members of their party, saying they would consider Supreme Court nominees put forward by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton if she wins the presidency, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on Sunday. The comments from U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, who is up for re-election on Tuesday, and U.S. Senator David Perdue came after Republican Senators John McCain and Ted Cruz suggested they might block any of Clintons potential nominees. You dont shirk your responsibility when youre an elected official. You sanctify your responsibility, and thats what Ill do. Ill consider who she nominates at the time she does and make a decision thats right for the people of Georgia, Isakson told the Atlanta newspaper. A spokeswoman for Perdue, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told the AJC: He wants to ensure we have a Supreme Court justice who will uphold the Constitution, and he will examine each nominee independently based on their merits. The death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in February has left the nine-member high court short one justice and evenly split between liberals and conservatives. In March, President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a federal appeals court judge, to replace Scalia, but the Republican-led Senate has refused to consider the nomination, saying the next president should make the pick. The Senates inaction on Garland, a centrist, has made the Supreme Court a potent issue in the election. After many years of leaning conservative, the court could tilt to the left for the first time in decades if Clinton wins the election. Isakson said he expects the Senate will confirm Garland before January in the event of a Clinton victory. Some Republicans fear Clinton would nominate a more liberal justice, swinging the ideologicalbalance of the court even further to the left. ",politicsNews,"November 6, 2016 ",1
Security hustles Trump from stage after protester displays sign,"RENO, Nevada/PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump was rushed off stage by security agents  at a rally in Reno, Nevada, on Saturday night after a false alarm as someone in the crowd shouted gun during scuffles with a man who held up a Republicans against Trump sign. The incident occurred as Trump and Democratic rival  Hillary Clinton crisscrossed the United States a late push to win over undecided voters and make sure supporters turn out enthusiastically on Election Day. Two security agents seized Trump by the shoulders and hustled him backstage as police officers swarmed over a man in the front of the crowd and held him down and searched him before escorting him away with his hands behind his back. Trump, seemingly unruffled, returned to the stage and continued his speech after a short time, saying Nobody said it was going to be easy for us and adding We will never be stopped. After being released, the man who was apprehended told CBS News Reno affiliate KTVN-2 that he was a Republican supporter who attended the rally to express his opposition to Trump. I came here with this sign expecting boos ... But it was just a sign, Austyn Crites said.  Crites said when he took it out, the crowd began to attack him, choking and beating him before someone yelled about a gun. After being held for a few hours questioning and security  and background checks, Crites said he was released, and that the police did their job. Crites said he wanted to contrast President Barack Obamas reaction to a protestor during a rally a few days ago, in which he urged the crowd to respect the protester, with Trumps, saying he wanted people to understand the difference. I have  nothing against Trump supporters, Crites told the station. We are all registered Republicans and support many of the same candidates for local offices. I have serious concern against Trump, he added. The Secret Service confirmed that the incident erupted when an unidentified individual in front of the stage shouted gun. Secret Service agents and Reno Police Officers immediately apprehended the subject. Upon a thorough search of the subject and the surrounding area, no weapon was found, the Secret Service said in a statement. The incident began when Trump noticed what he considered a heckler. Seconds later people near the stage began pointing at someone in the crowd near the front, and agents took Trump away. In a statement, Trump thanked the Secret Service, Reno and Nevada law enforcement for their fast and professional response. Meantime, in Philadelphia, pop singer Katy Perry performed at a Clinton rally, the latest in a string of celebrity appearances aimed at getting out the vote among millennials. When your kids and grandkids ask you what you did in 2016, when it was all on the line, I want you be able to say you voted for a better, stronger, America, Clinton said.   Opinion polls show Clinton still holds advantages in states that could be critical in deciding the election. But her lead has narrowed after a revelation a week ago that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was looking into a new trove of emails as part of its probe into her handling of classified information while she was secretary of state. A McClatchy-Marist opinion poll released on Saturday of  voters nationwide showed Clinton leading by 1 percentage point compared to 6 percentage points in September. A Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll on Saturday showed Clinton ahead by 4 percentage points nationally compared to 5 points on Friday, while an ABC News-Washington Post tracking poll had Clinton ahead by 48 to 43 percent. Both candidates spent time in Florida, considered one of the most hotly contested states. The 2000 presidential election was decided in Florida after a dispute over votes and recounting of ballots went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Republican George W. Bush over Democrat Al Gore. The Real Clear Politics average of Florida opinion polls found Clinton with a lead of about 1 percentage point - indicating the race there is a virtual tie. Trump spoke at a rally on Saturday morning in Tampa, Florida, where he continued to criticize Clinton for supporting the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, in the wake of an announcement that premiums are going to rise next year. Its not going to matter because if we win Im throwing it out anyway, Trump said. Shortly before Clinton took the stage in Pembroke Pines, Florida, rain poured down. People in the crowd waiting for Clinton at the outdoor rally remained in place, taking out umbrellas and fashioning garbage bags into head coverings. Im thrilled to be here and boy is this a hardy group, rain or shine you are ready, Clinton said, her voice cracking with hoarseness. She cut her speech short as she became soaked in rain, saying, I dont think I need to tell you all of the wrong things about Donald Trump. At the JFK library in Hialeah, Florida, people lined up outside for early voting. Nearby, supporters of both candidates waved signs and shouted slogans, urging passing drivers to honk their horns. We want someone to come in and clean house, said Cuban-American Ariel Martinez, 42, a Trump supporter. Early voting began in September and the data firm Catalist estimates more than 30 million ballots have been cast in 38 states. There are an estimated 225.8 million eligible U.S. voters. Saturday was the final day for early voting in many Florida counties. Trump and Clinton campaigns adjusted travel schedules for the next two days to states where they saw opportunity. Trump told the crowd in Tampa that there would be a campaign event in Minnesota this weekend, although one had not previously been scheduled. Minnesota has not voted for a Republican since 1984. His campaign confirmed a rally scheduled for Wisconsin on Sunday has been canceled. Clinton started the day by stopping by the West Miami Community Center, a Cuban American neighborhood, with telenovela star Jencarlos Canela, a Miami native of Cuban descent. She then visited her campaigns office in Little Haiti where there is a large concentration of Haitian-American residents. Clinton was joined by Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager who was shot dead in 2012 by a Sanford, Florida neighborhood watchman, George Zimmerman. While Trump prefers large-scale rallies, Clinton has filled her campaign schedule with targeted appearances meant to court voters in specific demographics. Cuban voters have historically favored Republicans, but younger generations have shifted toward Democratic Party candidates. In what was seen as an effort to defend typically Democratic turf, Clinton on Monday will campaign in Grand Rapids, Michigan, before returning to Pennsylvania for a rally in Philadelphia with President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, and former President Bill Clinton. Trump is to make stops on Sunday in Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia to try to steal away some states that have gone Democratic in recent presidential elections.

"Jump in Florida, Nevada early voting could reap Latino gains for Clinton","MIAMI (Reuters) - The man answering a volunteers knock on the door in the Kendall section of Miami-Dade County on Saturday was emphatic: Not only would he vote but esperamos que la presidenta gane - Spanish for we hope Madam President wins. Volunteers across Florida made a last-minute push to get voters to the polls this weekend with early voting ending on Sunday ahead of Election Day on Tuesday, pitting Republican Donald Trump against Democrat Hillary Clinton, or la presidenta, as the man at the door called her. Latino voters like the man in Kendall and elsewhere could have an outsized influence in Tuesdays election. Early voting data may portend a jump in the number of Hispanic voters this year, especially in the key swing states of Nevada and Florida, and Clinton would likely be the biggest beneficiary. Clinton has polled much stronger among Latino voters nationwide: a Washington Post/Univision poll released last week gave her 67 percent of the Hispanic vote to Trumps 19 percent. Trump has fared poorly with Americas largest minority voting group, having repeatedly angered Hispanics with disparaging comments about their communities.  A recent poll conducted by the firms The Tarrance Group and Bendixen and Amandi found that Hispanic registered voters in Florida favor Clinton 60 percent to 30 percent. In Nevada the gap was even wider - 72 percent for Clinton and 19 percent for Trump. In Florida, the Clinton campaign estimates early Latino voting is up 139 percent, or more than twice as much, compared to 2012, according to a field report dated Wednesday. Democratic strategist Steve Schale, a Florida expert, estimated that 170,000 more Hispanics had voted early or by mail as of Wednesday than had voted early or by mail in the entire 2012 election, according to a post on his blog. And keep in mind, because Hispanic is a self-identifying marker, studies have found that the real Hispanic vote is larger than the registration. So while Hispanics might make up 14.2 percent of the voters who have voted so far, in reality, the number is larger, he wrote. Despite the surge in early voting, there is no certainty about which candidate people chose for president. There is also no guarantee that the higher Latino turnout rate will continue on Election Day and that they and other minority voters will make enough of a difference to swing Florida and other states.  Trump kicked off his maverick campaign last year by describing Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals, and made a tough stance on immigration a signature part of his vision for America. He called for a wall to be built on the border and said an American-born federal judge could not do his job because of his Mexican heritage. That rhetoric might be hurting him in an increasingly diverse Florida, where many election watchers believe Trump must win to have a chance to secure the minimum 270 votes in the Electoral College needed to claim the White House.  Daniel Smith, a political science professor at the University of Florida who also does voting research, said Democrats have a strong lead among Hispanics who have voted early in Florida.  From my perspective this is Hispanics in Florida reacting viscerally to Donald Trump, said Smith. His scorched earth campaign against immigrants and especially Hispanics is coming home to roost in Florida. The state of Nevada does not note race or ethnicity on its voter registration but other data there suggest Latinos also are turning out in force. For one thing, Clark County has seen a surge in early voting. Between in-person and absentee voting, registered Democrats have now returned over 72,000 more ballots than registered Republicans there. Those figures do not indicate which candidate voters picked, only the party with which the voters are registered. Friday alone saw 57,172 votes in person in Clark County. Photos making the rounds on social media showed especially long lines at a Cardenas market voting site, which stayed open late to accommodate the surge of voters. Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, has a large Latino population  30.6 percent, compared to 28.1 percent for Nevada as a whole, according to the U.S. Census. Even more Republican votes elsewhere in the state are so far not enough to counterbalance that Democratic lead in Clark County. Overall, the Democrats have cast around 46,000 more ballots in Nevada than Republicans. Thats not an accident, said Artie Blanco, the Nevada state coordinator for the progressive group For Our Future. Her organization and others banded together in a major get-out-the-vote push, especially among voters of color, and the coalitions data suggest that the effort paid off. Twenty-two percent of Democrats who voted on Friday had a conversation with someone from that progressive coalition at some point after Oct. 15, Blanco said. Among Latino voters on the last three voting days, the coalition had conversations with 14 percent of them after Oct. 15, according to the groups data. Trump on Saturday took a jab at the early voting turnout in Nevada. They didnt get the kind of vote that they needed to stop us on Tuesday, Trump said in Reno. Tuesday is our day in this state. He said Reno and northern Nevada could carry us all the way to Washington.  But Blanco said the votes were instead the result of major work to bring out voters, especially people of color and that progressive organizations were not done yet. We have all these voters that we need to now go back and say, Youve got one day, she said of those who had not yet cast ballots. ",politicsNews,"November 6, 2016 ",1

U.S. Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz said in a tweet that Comey had informed him of the conclusion.

U.S. appeals court removes new voter-intimidation rules in Ohio,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won a legal battle on Sunday when a U.S. appeals court in Ohio removed new restrictions on partisan poll watchers that Democrats had sought to prevent Election Day voter intimidation. The rules overturned by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals would have imposed greater penalties on people who harass voters during Tuesdays election. Voter intimidation already is prohibited under U.S. law but Democrats have pushed for greater restrictions in Ohio and five other battleground states, citing concerns that Trumps heated rhetoric might inspire Election Day chaos. On the campaign trail, Trump has warned the election may be rigged and has called on supporters to keep an eye on voting activity for possible signs of fraud in large cities. Numerous studies have found that U.S. voter fraud is exceedingly rare.  On Friday U.S. District Court Judge James Gwin imposed new restrictions on those who monitor voting activity, saying they may not interrogate voters within 100 feet of a polling place, block them from entering, or photograph them as they come and go. Those found to violate the rules could be held in contempt of court. The Trump campaign had argued that those restrictions were not justified, given that there had been no reported instances of voter harassment in the state so far.  In the end, plaintiffs case rested on rhetoric, not evidence, Trump attorney Chad Readler wrote in a court filing on Saturday. The appeals court sided with Trump, lifting the new rules two days before Election Day. The ruling came before Democrats had a chance to respond to Readlers motion and the party said it may appeal. We are stunned that a court would rule without even allowing one of the parties to file a memo explaining their case, but that is exactly what the Sixth Circuit has done in this decision. We are exploring our options to reverse this unfortunate ruling, Ohio Democratic Party spokeswoman Kirstin Alvanitakis said. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"Social media helps U.S. millennial voters register, turnout worries linger","NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the youngest members of the millennial generation became old enough to vote in this years U.S. presidential election, states and social media platforms poured efforts into online registration, hoping to attract these tech savvy voters who now rival Baby Boomers as the countrys largest demographic. With Election Day just two days away, political experts are skeptical that a record number of millennials who signed up to vote will actually result in the 18-34 year-old age group turning out at the polls in proportion to their relative size of the U.S. population. Millennials make up approximately 31 percent of U.S. citizens eligible to vote, according to the Pew Research Center, on par for the first time with Baby Boomers, who are typically aged 52-70 years old. There are an estimated 225.8 million eligible U.S. voters.   Millennials have so far, however, turned out in much lower numbers in elections than Baby Boomers. In 2008, a record year for millennial turnout, just 50 per cent of those eligible to vote did so, the National Census Bureau said. That compared with turnout rates of 69 per cent for Baby Boomers and 61 percent for people aged 36 to 51, also known as Generation X. This year, a number of efforts on social media by states and non-profits aimed to change that, including Facebook reminders on users accounts, Twitter hashtag campaigns, celebrities creating Snapchat and an Instagram post urging people to vote. According to a survey of state electoral officials and voter non-profits around the United States, these social media campaigns have paid off, at least when it came to getting young voters registered.  A survey of 2,000 millennials conducted by social media platform Yik Yak, which is known for its popularity among college students and teens, showed that 62 percent registered to vote for the first time this year and, of those, 9 percent registered online following a social media prompt. In California, roughly 31 per cent of all registered voters are now aged 18-35. A Facebook reminder on May 16 coincided with 143,255 people registering or updating their registrations online that day in the state, compared to an average of 23,166 per day that month, said California Secretary of State spokesman Sam Mahood. Other states reported similar spikes. In Oregon, more than 420,000 people registered to vote online in 2016, up from 2012 when 163,545 used the online system. Digital voter enrollments in Washington jumped by roughly 135,000 in 2016, compared to 2012. From January through mid-October this year, 381,318 people used the online system in Indiana, nearly three times as many as in 2012.  Lets face it - thats where [younger voters] are; theyre on social media, said Denise Merrill, the secretary of state for Connecticut, which used social media campaigns, including a dedicated hashtag and Facebooks banner ads, to drive registrations. Whatever were doing, were having pretty dramatic results. Like a lot of experts, Donald Green, a professor of political science at Columbia University, is skeptical that an increase in young voter registration will correspond with millennials unseating the Baby Boomers as the most active voting bloc. Green conceded that there was change afoot, but said he thought it would far more gradual. By his estimate, it would be  25 years before millennials overtake Baby Boomers, or what he dubbed generational replacement. In presidential elections the translation of new registration to votes is more like one half or one third, he said. Michael Cornfield, an associate professor of political management at George Washington University, agreed that registering someone to vote does not guarantee theyll show up on Election Day. Its up to the campaigns to do the last bit, which is to say make sure the right millennials in the right battleground states are being targeted, said Cornfield. Some political experts said that, in general, millennials tend to vote more for Democratic Party candidates than Republicans. Laura Wray-Lake, an assistant professor at the University of California-Los Angeles, said the increase in millennial registration could be a boon for Democrats if they could harness some of the social media techniques used to register voters to get them to the polls.  With many political experts expecting overall voter turnout to be lower this year, millennial voters in swing states are a bloc that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton could hope to turn out. Clinton leads Republican candidate Donald Trump by 27 percentage points among likely voters ages 18-34, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Young people have huge potential for political impact Wray-Lake said. I think eventually these millennials will be deciding the future of the country.

"Amid scandal, bluster and insults, Trump closes in on White House","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Supercharging the bluster, hyperbole and media mastery that made him one of the worlds best-known businessmen, Donald Trump upended U.S. democratic traditions on a 17-month quest he hopes will lead to the White House.        From his grand Trump Tower escalator entrance into the Republican presidential race on June 16, 2015, Trump managed to be simultaneously charismatic and combative, elitist and populist, lewd and pious as he drilled into a lode of polarity and anti-Washington anger among American voters.  In Tuesdays election against Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump is making his first run for public office. Trump called it a movement, not a campaign. He drew enthusiastic crowds to rallies where people cheered him for just saying what everybodys thinking. Critics  labeled him misogynistic, ill-informed, uncouth, unpresidential, a racist, a hypocrite, a demagogue and a sexual predator, all accusations he denied. It took Trump, 70, little more than 10 months to vanquish 16 other candidates and become the first major party nominee since General Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s to have no government experience. He drew a record number of votes in primary contests but in so doing created a rift in the party.   Then he squared off against Clinton, 69, in a race marked by controversies that included upheaval in his staff, charges he had groped women, and his claim, never supported, that Clinton and the media had rigged the election against him. He shocked many by saying he might not accept the election result if he lost, repudiating a U.S. tradition of peaceful government transition. He said that as president he would investigate Clinton for her use of email while secretary of state. He vowed to send her to jail. His campaign took a scandalous turn in October with the release of a 2005 video in which Trump, unaware he was being recorded, told a television entertainment reporter that he liked to kiss women without invitation and that, because he was rich and famous, he could grab them by the genitals without recriminations. Trump dismissed the remarks as locker room talk and denied the subsequent accusations from more than 10 women who said he had groped them or made unwanted sexual advances. Throughout his campaign - and especially in his Republican convention speech in July - Trump described a dark America that had been knocked to its knees by China, Mexico, Russia and Islamic State. The American dream was dead, he said, smothered by malevolent business interests and corrupt politicians, and he said he alone could revive it. Trump said he would make America great again through the force of his personality, negotiating skill and business acumen. He offered vague plans to win economic concessions from China, to build a wall on the southern U.S. border to keep out undocumented immigrants and to make Mexico pay for it. He vowed to repeal Obamacare while being the greatest jobs president that God ever created and has proposed refusing entry to the United States of people from war-torn Middle Eastern nations, a modified version of an earlier proposed ban on Muslims.  Trump promoted himself as the ultimate success story. He dated beautiful women, married three of them, had his own television reality show and erected skyscrapers that bore his name in big gold letters. Everything in his life was the greatest, the hugest, the classiest, the most successful, he said, even though critics assailed his experiences with bankruptcies, the failures of his Atlantic City, New Jersey, casinos and what they viewed as the misplaced pride he showed when presented with evidence he avoided paying taxes. Trump had flirted with presidential runs in the past and some initially saw his campaign as a vanity project meant to indulge his ego and burnish his brand. It was expected to be short-lived but as the election season progressed, he became the front-runner, winning state nominating contests despite an unconventional campaign that relied on large-scale rallies and mostly ignored grass-roots work. His hired advisers came to realize there was only so much they could do to rein him in. His inner circle was dominated by his three oldest children - Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, along with Ivankas husband, Jared Kushner.      The rise of Trump, once a registered Democrat, threatened to blow up the Republican Party. Its establishment challenged his commitment to their tenets and organized against him. Prominent Republicans - including former presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush and congressional leaders - shunned him or offered lukewarm support. Trump used Twitter as a weapon, firing off insults and mockery at those who offended him, including Crooked Hillary and Republican rivals Little Marco Rubio, Jeb Low Energy Bush and Lyin Ted Cruz. Another target was the family of a Muslim U.S. Army captain who died fighting in Iraq after the soldiers father had spoken against Trump at the Democratic National Convention. Trump sniped back for days despite advice to move on. As of late October, the New York Times had counted 282 people and things he had insulted on Twitter since declaring his candidacy.  The Trump candidacy was brimming with contradictions. The candidate who vowed to bring back jobs to the United States had his clothing line and campaign hats manufactured in foreign countries. The man who decried the corrupting power of money in politics boasted of having bought influence himself. Undocumented workers had been used on his building projects but as a candidate Trump vowed to ship illegal immigrants out of the country. He said no one respected women more than he did but even before the groping accusations emerged, he was branded a misogynist for making fun of the appearance of rival candidate Carly Fiorina and an apparent reference to the menstrual cycle of Fox News Megyn Kelly. Trumps campaign trail demeanor seemed to draw from his experiences as host of The Apprentice, a reality TV show where he barked a crowd-pleasing Youre fired! at contestants who fell short in competitions. His speeches were often unscripted and featured boasts on everything from his money to his IQ. He peppered them with dubiously sourced declarations, misperceptions and false statements. He suggested that gun rights activists could act to stop  Clinton from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices, a remark the Clinton campaign called dangerous. Trump boasted of a fortune he put at $10 billion, although in September Forbes magazine estimated it at $3.7 billion, making him the 156th richest American. Trump regularly made comments that would have doomed a more conventional candidate, such as when he said his supporters were so loyal that he could shoot someone on 5th Avenue in New York and not lose a single vote. In May he would draw accusations of racism for questioning the impartiality of a judge - born in the United States to Mexican immigrants - who was hearing a lawsuit against him. No other candidate referred to the size of his genitals during a debate. He was flattered when Russian President Vladimir Putin called him a brilliant and talented leader. Trump mocked Senator John McCain, the Republicans presidential candidate in 2008, for having been captured during the Vietnam War and said he wanted to punch a protester in the face at a Trump rally. Trump was born to money on June 14, 1946, in the New York City borough of Queens, the fourth of five children of Fred Trump, who would become one of the citys biggest developers and landlords, and his wife. It was Fred Trump who taught Donald the value of self-promotion and a killer instinct. By his own admission, Trump was not an easy child and in the eighth grade his parents sent him to the New York Military Academy in hopes of instilling needed discipline. Through student and medical deferments during the Vietnam War, Trump would never serve in the U.S. military but said the school gave him more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Trump went to work for his fathers company, which focused on the outer New York City boroughs of Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island and owned an estimated 15,000 apartments. In 1973 the Trumps were charged with racial bias in their rental practices before reaching a settlement with the U.S. government. With a $1 million loan from his father, Trump eventually went into business himself in Manhattan, where he became a regular at some of the citys most exclusive clubs and developed a reputation as a ladies man.  He soon made his mark with a series of real estate and development deals, including redoing an old hotel at New Yorks Grand Central Terminal. In 1983 he opened his flagship, 58-story Trump Tower, which serves as both his primary residence and Trump Organization headquarters. More projects around the world would follow, including golf courses, the Mar-a-Lago private resort in Florida, New Yorks venerable Plaza Hotel and casinos. Trumps projects had mixed success. The flops included the real estate-oriented Trump University, Trump Mortgage, Trump Airlines and Trump Vodka but it was his experience with four casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, that took the golden luster off his empire.  Timothy OBrien, author of TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald, wrote that in the 1990s Trump was out of money and twice had to go to his siblings for loans. A former employee said the Trump Organization would have shut down if the family had not come through but Trump disputed that in his 1997 book Trump: The Art of the Comeback. While he never filed for personal bankruptcy, the downturn in the gaming industry sentparts of Trumps corporate empireto bankruptcy court in 1991, 1992, 2004 and 2009. In the 2009 bankruptcy, the unsecured creditors received less than a penny on the dollar for their claim. Trump resigned as chairman four days before the filing. ",politicsNews,"November 6, 2016 ",1
Final reckoning approaches for Obama's high court nominee,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several intriguing scenarios could unfold after Tuesdays U.S. election to break the deadlock over filling a Supreme Court vacancy that has provoked a bitter nine-month standoff between President Barack Obama and Senate Republicans. Obama nominated U.S. appeals court judge Merrick Garland on March 16 to replace long-serving conservative justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13. The Republican-led Senate, in a move with little precedent, has refused to consider the nomination, saying the winner of the presidential election should make the pick. If Republican Donald Trump wins, Garlands nomination would be dead. Trump has already put forth a list of conservative jurists as potential nominees. If Obamas fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton wins, there are ways Garland could secure Senate confirmation to the lifetime post before Obama leaves office on Jan. 20. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has been adamant that Obamas successor should select Scalias replacement and that he will not consider Garlands nomination during a post-election lame duck session. But McConnell could come under pressure by some Senate Republicans to allow confirmation hearings and a vote on Garland, who has a reputation in Washington as a moderate, out of fear Clinton could instead choose a more liberal nominee. The Senates inaction on Garland has made the Supreme Court a potent issue in the election. After many years of leaning conservative, a new Democratic appointment could tilt the court to the left for the first time in decades. Scalias death left the court split with four liberals and four conservatives. Conservative activists dismiss the notion Garland is a moderate, saying he would vote with the four liberal justices on major, ideologically divisive issues. Garland is a liberal, not a centrist, said Carrie Severino, a lawyer with the Judicial Crisis Network. Liberal activists like Caroline Fredrickson, president of the American Constitution Society, said Republicans should move forward on Garland. Hes got every qualification you could ask for. Hes exactly the type of judge they claimed they wanted, Fredrickson said. If Democrats win control of the Senate in Tuesdays election, the new congressional session would begin on Jan. 3, and they could decide to move forward immediately on Garlands nomination before Obamas term ends. Clinton would play a major role by deciding whether or not she wanted to stick with Garland, who was named to his current job by her husband Bill Clinton in 1997, or choose her own nominee. Chief Judge Garland is the most experienced nominee to the Supreme Court in our nations history, White House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said. It is time for Republicans to stop putting politics over the best interest of the country and do their job by giving the presidents nominee to the Supreme Court a hearing and a vote, she added. Clinton has said Garland should be confirmed this year but has not committed to re-nominating him if she wins. Some Republicans have floated the idea of staunch opposition to any Clinton nominee, raising the possibility of the seat remaining vacant long-term. McConnell has said no Obama nominee will be confirmed this year. There are no signs so far of Republican leaders backing off that position. Garland, 63, and other members of the Washington legal community joined the eight current justices inside the Supreme Courts ornate courtroom on Friday at an memorial event honoring Scalia, four days before the election that will help decide his fate. There has been little controversy over Garlands suitability to sit on the Supreme Court as there has been with some past nominees. He is widely respected in the legal community and has won praise from Democrats and Republicans. ",politicsNews,"November 6, 2016 ",1

'You're fired' - Trump effigy feels the heat on UK bonfire night,"LONDON (Reuters) - He turned Youre fired into his reality show catch-phrase, but it was Donald Trump who went up in flames on Saturday - or at least an effigy of him did, as part of Britains annual Bonfire Night celebrations. An 11-metre-high (36 feet) model of the Republican U.S. presidential candidate was burned at a fireworks display in the town of Edenbridge, 30 miles (50 km) south of London. The sculpture showed Trump, complete with his trademark mop of hair, holding his Democratic rival for the White House, Hilary Clinton, in a headlock, and sporting a pair of Mexico-themed boxer shorts. I think he would be quietly amused, artist Frank Shepherd said of his muse.  Britain celebrates the failed attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliament in 1605 by letting off fireworks and lighting bonfires with an effigy of the Gunpowder Plot leader Guy Fawkes on top. The celebrations in Edenbridge also feature effigies of unpopular celebrities and in the past have included former FIFA president Sepp Blatter, former Prime Minister Tony Blair, deposed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and disgraced American cyclist Lance Armstrong. Other contenders for this years choice included Philip Green, the billionaire former owner of failed retail chain BHS who is under pressure to resolve the firms pension problems, and Sam Allardyce who quit as England soccer manager in September, after one game in charge, after a newspaper sting. Effigies of Trump, including one of him sitting atop a Mexican border control wall, were also due to go up in smoke on Saturday at a fireworks display in the town of Lewes, 60 miles south of London.

"Dependent on migrant dollars, rural Mexico prays for Trump defeat","MOLCAXAC, Mexico (Reuters) - In the small southern market town of Molcaxac, 650 miles (1050 km) from the U.S. border, Alicia Villa is praying to God that Republican candidate Donald Trump does not become the next president of the United States. Over the past two decades, as Mexicos rural economy stalled, Molcaxac and hundreds of towns like it became dependent on dollars sent by relatives who made the perilous journey north, a lifeline she fears will be cut by a Trump White House. Villa, 65, said funds sent by a daughter working illegally as a house cleaner in Sacramento, California have supported her family for 12 years because the work she does as receptionist in Molcaxac does not pay enough to make ends meet. I am Catholic and I have asked God and the Virgin of Asuncion that he lose, Villa said of Trump, placing her head in her hands and intoning a prayer in the square of the deeply religious hill town dominated by a striking blue church. Inside, the church was adorned with notes thanking migrant relatives for money sent to help build homes, start businesses and pay for marriages in the town surrounded by rivers, mountains and meadows in the state of Puebla. Trump says he will kick out everyone who doesnt have papers and we really need them to be there, said Villa, adding that she had not seen some family members living in the United States in 20 years. Trump, a real-estate tycoon who has narrowed the gap with  Democratic rival Hillary Clinton ahead of next Tuesdays vote, has vowed to make it harder for illegal immigrants to live and work in the United States, to increase deportations and to limit remittances unless Mexico pays billions for a wall along the nearly 2,000-mile (3,200-km) U.S.-Mexico border. Such policies would take a heavy toll in Molcaxac, where local authorities say more than 70 percent of the population lives on remittances sent home by immigrants to the United States, many of them undocumented. Our town has improved a lot since our people started to leave for the United States, said stonemason Esteban Marquez, whose workshop was partly funded by remittances from one of his children. Mexico has more than 5 million citizens living without regular papers in the United States, or about half of the entire undocumented population. Those men and women send back a large chunk of Mexicos foreign exchange earnings, contributing more than $20 billion in remittances wired this year through September. According to Mexicos Central Bank, Puebla received $1 billion in remittances in the same period, making it the fifth biggest recipient among Mexican states. So many people from Puebla live in the New York area that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Trump supporter, visited the state in 2014. Couriers have grown rich transporting salsas and fresh cheese to homesick natives up north.  The money has transformed places like Molcaxac, a  picturesque town dotted with well-built homes attesting to the flow of dollars. It is not just the potential loss of income Trump could spark that worries Molcaxac locals. The lack of employment in rural Mexico is one of the main reasons drug gangs find it easy to recruit among young people and those deported from the United States, they say. Here in Mexico, the truth is there is nothing for them, said stonemason Marquez. The people who stay need to survive, and since there is no work, they get pulled into crime. Opinion polls in the run-up to the election suggest that Villas prayers stand a good chance of being answered, with most putting Clinton consistently ahead of her Republican rival. But the polls also show her losing ground in the final stretch. Real Clear Politics, which averages the results of most major polls, shows Clintons advantage had declined from 4.6 percentage points to 1.7 points over the past week. Even those of more modest means in Molcaxac are on edge with Americas election. Only God knows if they are going to be able to stay there, said Serafina Martinez, who at 70 still works in the fields. She worries it would be hard to survive without the little her son in California sends when he can. I would like him to keep helping us with pennies, said Martinez, her curved back laden with firewood and groceries.  Still, the uncertainty has also helped locals in an unexpected way: the Mexican pesos value plunges every time Trump advances, making the dollar remittances stretch further. But there is no doubt in the minds of Molcaxacs townspeople that they would rather see Clinton in the White House. Clinton has proposed comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship, and says she will end detention of immigrant families.  I think she will win, and that gives us hope that our relatives will be able to regularize (their papers), said Teresa Amador, selling flowers in the main market. I have a son who was born there, and he is going to vote for the lady. ",politicsNews,"November 5, 2016 ",1
Arizona may enforce ballot collection law: Supreme Court order,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday ordered an Arizona state law that restricts the collection of ballots by third parties back in place for Tuesdays election, a victory for Republicans in an intensifying state-by-state legal battle over access to voting. The Supreme Court granted a stay of a U.S. appeals court ruling that on Friday had temporarily blocked Arizona from enforcing the law that prohibits advocacy groups from collecting completed early ballots from voters and delivering them to election offices as part of get-out-the-vote efforts. The stay will remain in effect pending a final disposition of the appeal by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court order said. The appeals court has scheduled oral arguments in the case for January. Polls have shown Republican Donald Trump with a small lead in Arizona over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. Democrats have accused Republicans of enacting state laws intended to make it harder for minorities and others who tend to back Democratic candidates to cast ballots. Republicans have called these laws necessary to guard against voting fraud. Arizona late Friday filed an emergency appeal asking the U.S. Supreme Court to allow it to enforce the law Arizonas legislature approved earlier this year. Plaintiffs in the case, including the Democratic National Committee, argued the law is unconstitutional because it unfairly impacted the ability of minorities to vote. In asking the Supreme Court to deny a stay, the plaintiffs said reinstating the law would expose Arizonans who are presently engaged in ballot collection and do not learn of this courts ruling to a felony conviction and criminal sanctions.

"Clinton, Trump clash over economy in final campaign stretch","CLEVELAND/HERSHEY, Pa. (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump battled over the strength of the economy in the final stretch of their race for the White House on Friday, with Clinton praising the latest U.S. jobs report and Trump dismissing it as a fraudulent disaster. With four days left in an often bitter contest that has tightened in the last week, each candidate attacked the other as unfit to be president in a late push for votes in battleground states that could decide the outcome in Tuesdays election. Clinton leads Trump by 5 percentage points, according to a Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll released on Friday, maintaining her advantage in the national survey even as the race tightens in several crucial swing states. In the Oct. 30-Nov. 3 opinion poll, 44 percent of likely voters supported Clinton while 39 percent supported Trump.  Clinton wrapped up her day of campaigning with a nighttime concert in Cleveland headlined by rapper Jay Z. He was joined by rappers Big Sean, Chance the Rapper, and J. Cole, and by his wife, popular singer Beyonce, as a surprise guest. We have unfinished work to do, more barriers to break, and with your help, a glass ceiling to crack once and for all, Clinton said at the concert.   At his final rally of the day in Pennsylvania, Trump mocked  Clinton for her celebrity supporters. I am here all by myself. Just me, no guitar, no piano, no nothing, he said. Earlier in the day at a rally in Pittsburgh, Clinton cited the governments latest jobs report as evidence of the economys strength. The report showed higher wages for workers as well as the creation of 161,000 jobs in October and a dip in the unemployment rate to 4.9 percent from 5 percent. I believe our economy is poised to really take off and thrive, Clinton told the gathering, after being introduced by billionaire investor Mark Cuban. When the middle class thrives, America thrives. Trump disputed Clintons rosy view, telling a crowd in New Hampshire that the jobs report was an absolute disaster and was skewed by the large number of people who have stopped looking for jobs and are no longer in the labor market. Nobody believes the numbers anyway. The numbers they put out are phony, he said, referring to the figures released by the U.S. Labor Department. The economy and the candidates competing visions for the future could be critical in swaying voters in ailing Rust Belt states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Both candidates made stops in Ohio and Pennsylvania on Friday, with Trump adding a stop in New Hampshire and Clinton adding one in Michigan. Each of those states is key in the state-by-state quest for the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. The race has tightened significantly in the past week, as several swing states that are considered must-wins for Trump shifted from favoring Clinton to toss-ups, according to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project. The two candidates are now tied in Florida and North Carolina, and Clintons lead in Michigan has narrowed so much that the state is too close to call. Ohio remains a dead heat, and Clinton has a slight lead in Pennsylvania. Clinton is still the favorite to win Tuesdays election, with a clearer path to winning of the Electoral College. But Trump now has a plausible route to victory, especially if there is a sharp fall in turnout among African-Americans from the levels of the 2012 election. Trump, a New York businessman and former reality TV star, has made a pitch for blue-collar workers who have been angered by free-trade deals and feel abandoned by Washington. But his protectionist rhetoric - he has promised to review trade agreements - appears to be having mixed success in the Rust Belt. Reuters/Ipsos polling from mid-October found a majority in both Ohio and Pennsylvania believe that international trade benefits Americans by keeping the cost of goods low, although they also think it hurts average Americans by depressing wages and causing job losses at home. Clinton appears to be leading among labor union households in both states, the poll found. She has a double-digit lead with women in both, while Trump has a more modest lead with men. Among whites, Trump has a 7-point lead over Clinton in Ohio and a 3-point lead over Clinton in Pennsylvania. In the final stretch, the two candidates continued to paint a dire scenario of life in the United States if their opponent captures the White House. Trump said the FBIs fresh examination of emails that may be related to Clintons use of a private email server for government work while she was secretary of state could lead to a constitutional crisis. Arent we tired of all this stuff? he asked. America deserves a government that can go to work on Day One. GET-OUT-THE-VOTE PUSH Clinton suggested the volatile Trump, who has feuded with and insulted a wide array of people and groups including Muslims, Mexican immigrants and women, was too unpredictable to trust. Think about what it would mean to entrust the nuclear codes to someone with very thin skin who lashes out at anyone who insults him, she said. Clinton has deployed high-profile supporters to campaign for her in the final days of the long race.   President Barack Obama praised her work as his first-term top diplomat during an appearance in North Carolina. She was outstanding in her job. She was loyal to me, he said. Obama is trying to energize African-Americans, with whom he is very popular, and young people to turn out for Clinton the way they did for him in 2008 and 2012. Hispanic groups in swing states cranked up their get-out-the-vote efforts for the final stretch of the race on Friday, hoping to push the contest Clintons way. ",politicsNews,"November 4, 2016 ",1
"Fate of Obama legacy initiatives in hands of courts, successor","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When President Barack Obama leaves office on Jan. 20 after eight years, several of his major initiatives will still hang in the legal balance, meaning the U.S. courts and his successor will play a major role in shaping his legacy. Ongoing legal challenges by Republican-governed states and business groups are targeting Obamas signature healthcare law, his plan to combat climate change, a key immigration initiative, his transgender rights policy, his net neutrality internet rules, overtime pay for workers and other matters. Most of the cases are awaiting rulings by trial judges or regional federal appeals courts and could be bound for the U.S. Supreme Court, but are unlikely to get there until after the winner of Tuesdays election, pitting Democrat Hillary Clinton against Republican Donald Trump, is sworn in.  Unless the U.S. Senate changes course and confirms Obamas nominee, appellate court judge Merrick Garland, to fill the vacant ninth seat on the ideologically split Supreme Court, the next president would be responsible for selecting a new justice who could cast the deciding vote in these cases.  The Supreme Court has already agreed to decide a major transgender rights case. Obamas administration is backing a female-born transgender high school student named Gavin Grimm, who identifies as male and sued in 2015 to win the right to use the schools boys bathroom. A ruling, which also could resolve similar litigation around the country, is not due until the end of June. In another transgender rights case, a number of states challenged the Obama administrations May guidance to public schools nationwide to let transgender students use bathrooms of their choice. A federal judge blocked the policy in August while the litigation continues. Because Obama during much of his presidency has faced a Republican-controlled Congress hostile to his legislative initiatives, he has often bypassed lawmakers and used executive power to advance policy goals. Despite having majorities in both houses of Congress, Republicans have refused to govern. Instead, this litigious Republican Party has rushed to the courts with partisan lawsuits, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. Those challenging Obama have vowed to fight on unless his successor changes course. Should a new administration rescind those policies and respect the bounds placed before it, we will happily direct our energies elsewhere, added Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has helped spearhead various legal challenges to Obama. Clinton, backed by Obama in her White House bid, could be expected to leave in place or even expand on his initiatives and to defend them in court. Trump, if elected, could quickly reverse Obama executive orders as promised. But undoing large-scale regulations like power plant emissions rules could be more complicated.  Its not at the stroke of a pen, said Sean Donahue, a lawyer representing environmental groups that backed Obama administration climate rules known as the Clean Power Plan. Trump would have to undergo a new, lengthy rule-making process, according to legal experts. The case with the biggest potential long-term impact is the challenge by states and industry groups to Obamas Clean Power Plan, which would curb greenhouse emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants. The rules are an important legacy issue for Obama. They also are vital to U.S. obligations under last years international climate change treaty. A federal appeals court heard oral arguments in September. A ruling is not due for months. The case is likely to go to the Supreme Court on appeal. The Supreme Court put the regulations on hold in February while the litigation continues. Republicans and conservative groups have launched numerous challenges to the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. The Supreme Court in 2012 and 2015 issued rulings preserving Obamas top legislative achievement.  Now, another Republican-led legal challenge is making its way through the courts. The administration has appealed a district court judges May decision that the federal government cannot spend billions of dollars to provide subsidies under Obamacare to help individuals buy policies from private insurers without congressional approval. Separately, the administration is seeking in federal court in Texas to revive Obamas 2014 executive action to protect millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation and give them work permits. The plan, challenged by Texas and other states, has been barred by the courts. The Supreme Court, split 4-4, in June left in place lower court orders blocking the plan, and in October declined to revisit that ruling.  Other Obama regulations have been targeted by business groups. A federal appeals court in June upheld Obamas landmark net neutrality rules barring internet service providers from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content. The case remains under appeal. In September, states and business groups filed a legal challenge to an administration rule to extend mandatory overtime pay to millions of workers. A ruling is not due until after Obama leaves office. Graphic: Courts weigh Obama legacy - here ",politicsNews,"November 5, 2016 ",1
Ex-Christie associates guilty in New Jersey 'Bridgegate' scandal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two former associates of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie were convicted on Friday for their roles in the Bridgegate lane closure scandal, following a six-week trial that served to further tarnish the Republicans damaged reputation. Bridget Kelly, the governors former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, were found guilty in Newark federal court on all counts. They were convicted of fraud, conspiracy and depriving the residents of Fort Lee, New Jersey, of their civil rights. Christie, who is in charge of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps transition team, has not been criminally charged, but the scandal has torpedoed what was once seen as a promising political career. Christie on Friday again denied having had any advance knowledge of the scheme to choke traffic heading for the busy George Washington Bridge, which links New Jersey and Manhattan.  I had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments, and had no role in authorizing them, Christie said in a statement following the verdict. Anything said to the contrary over the past six weeks in court is simply untrue. The scandal has dogged Christie, once seen as a potential presidential nominee before his campaign for the White House failed this year. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintons campaign chairman John Podesta said on Friday Trump should ask Christie to resign as head of his transition team. Legal experts have said it is unlikely Christie would face any criminal consequences based on the trial testimony.  Baroni and Kelly were accused of shutting down access lanes to the bridge in September 2013 in Fort Lee, New Jersey, creating a massive days-long traffic jam to punish the towns mayor, Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for declining to endorse Christies reelection campaign. The Port Authority, which runs the bridge, says it is the worlds busiest, carrying 102 million vehicles a year on the I-95 interstate highway, a major east coast traffic artery. Lawyers for Kelly and Baroni vowed to appeal. This is not over, Kellys lawyer Michael Critchley said outside the courthouse, with his arm around his weeping client. He said the judge had erred during jury instructions. Defense lawyers were furious when U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton told jurors in response to a question they could convict Kelly and Baroni on conspiracy even if the act itself was not intentionally punitive toward Mayor Sokolich. Wigenton said prosecutors did not have to prove motive, even though their case had revolved around the political retribution. By answering the way youre answering, youre directing a verdict of guilty, an angry Critchley told Wigenton on Tuesday. Baronis lawyer, Michael Baldassare, told reporters the case was a disgrace and said the conviction would be overturned. I am innocent of these charges, a smiling Baroni said. Kelly and Baronis co-conspirator, former Port Authority official and confessed mastermind David Wildstein, had earlier pleaded guilty and appeared as the governments star witness, detailing how the three schemed to pay back Sokolich. But Wildstein also implicated Christie, saying he and Baroni discussed the lane closures with the governor while they were ongoing. Christie, Wildstein testified, laughed at the notion that Sokolich was frustrated by the traffic. At the time, Christie believed that securing the backing of Democratic officials would burnish his national reputation, according to trial testimony. Kelly, who took the stand in her defense, testified she had discussed the lane closures with Christie a month beforehand, though she said she thought at the time they were part of a legitimate traffic study. I take no pleasure in this verdict, said U.S. Attorney of New Jersey Paul Fishman, a successor of Christie in that position. Fishman, whose office prosecuted the case, said he was saddened by the conduct of top government officials. Kelly and Baronis lawyers argued that Wildstein had orchestrated the plot himself and told them he was conducting a traffic study. Wildstein said on the stand the three of them knew all along that the study was a bogus cover story. Prosecutors showed jurors numerous exchanges that Kelly and Baroni each had with Wildstein, who operated as liaison between Baroni at the Port Authority and Kelly in the governors office. Those included Kellys now-infamous email to Wildstein that prosecutors said launched the scheme, in which she wrote, Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee. Kelly and Baroni are scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 21. Each faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison on the most serious charge of fraud, though it is unlikely they would receive such a lengthy term. ",politicsNews,"November 4, 2016 ",1
Freedom or 'fool's errand'? D.C. to vote on statehood referendum,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Long-frustrated backers of statehood for the District of Columbia are pinning their hopes on a first-ever referendum on Tuesday in a long-shot bid to become the 51st U.S. state. Invoking the colonial-era demand of no taxation without representation, supporters say becoming a state would end Washingtonians status as second-class citizens because they lack representation in Congress. But opponents dismiss the referendum as a fools errand  destined to fail because of partisan political hurdles and the need to amend the U.S. Constitution, a procedure accomplished only 17 times since 1789. The District of Columbia was carved out to serve as the nations capital, but it is not a state. Its 672,000 residents have no voting representative in the Senate or House of Representatives although they pay federal taxes, though they do have a delegate in the House.   A yes vote could help pressure the new Congress and president - either Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump - to admit the District of Columbia as a new state, though even advocates admit that is unlikely anytime soon. A yes vote would simply be an expression of public support for statehood, a non-binding measure without any legal force. Statehoods the only way that we can have the same rights and responsibilities as all the other citizens of the United States, District of Columbia Council Chairman Phil Mendelson said. The overwhelmingly Democratic capital city was fed up with Republican lawmakers espousing the rights of states and cities to self-governance and then interfering with local issues such as abortion and marijuana legalization, Mendelson said. Thats so antithetical to democratic principles, but that doesnt seem to bother some of these folks, he said. The referendum seeks to upend the Constitutions provision giving Congress legislative control over the District of Columbia. Voters will cast a single yes or no vote on the referendums four parts: admission as a state, its boundaries, approval of a constitution, and guarantees of a representative form of government. The new state would embrace the current 68-square-mile (176-square-km) district except for a core of federal property around the White House, Capitol and monument-rich National Mall.  The District Council approved the referendum unanimously, and a Washington Post poll in November 2015 showed 67 percent of residents backed statehood. The Democratic Partys national platform also supports the idea. If youre not part of a state, large parts of the constitution dont apply to you, said statehood advocate Ann Loikow. Mayor Muriel Bowser and other statehood backers took the votes design from the successful bid in the 1790s by Tennessee, then a federal territory, to become a state through a referendum and petition to Congress. Supporters and skeptics say that even if the referendum passes it would face a dead end in Congress, where Republicans would oppose statehood since it would add Democratic senators and a representative to Congress. Besides the political obstacles, Roger Pilon, a constitutional scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, called the statehood quest a fools errand because of constitutional obstacles. For the District to become a state, Congress would have to propose an amendment to the Constitution, which would then have to win a two-thirds majority vote in both the Senate and the House.  Even if an amendment could win approval in both houses of Congress, it would face another big hurdle: approval by the legislatures of at least three-fourths of the 50 states. Washingtonians have tried to achieve statehood before, but never by an up-or-down referendum. Congress ignored a statehood petition that included a constitution voters ratified in the 1980s. The House of Representatives rejected a statehood bill in 1993, and it failed to reach a Senate vote. A constitutional amendment for voting rights in Congress fizzled in the 1980s.

California cities see chance to cash in on marijuana,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Californians are expected to pass a ballot measure on Election Day legalizing recreational marijuana, and the prospect has cities and counties seeing dollar signs. Proposition 64 would impose state taxes on the cultivation and sale of marijuana. But it also allows local jurisdictions to add taxes of their own, something many cities and counties said they plan to do. Economists warn that burdensome taxes and fees on the nascent industry could backfire, fueling the black market and pushing marijuana businesses to decamp for towns where its cheaper to operate. For many city and county officials across California, however, the promise of new revenue to fill budget gaps and fund services is too alluring to pass up.  More than 60 local marijuana measures will appear on ballots across California in Tuesdays election. In Monterey, a scenic county along the states rugged central coast, officials said new local marijuana taxes and fees, if approved, could bring in $30 million, nearly double the countys $16 million budget deficit. In Coalinga, a Fresno County community of about 13,000, officials hope to solve a $3 million budget crisis with marijuana taxes. Central Californias King City anticipates new revenues of $1 million to $2 million, or almost 30 percent of the citys general fund. Proposed marijuana taxes in Gonzales, population 8,400, are projected to hit $1.6 million, more than the city collects annually in sales and property taxes combined.  There is no other business that would generate this type of revenue, Gonzales City Manager Rene Mendez said. Its easy to see why this is something that communities want to pursue. Some California communities have gone further, announcing plans to reinvent themselves as hubs for the industry. Desert Hot Springs in Southern California, a town that narrowly skirted bankruptcy after the financial crash, was one of a few cities to pass a marijuana tax in 2014. It is eager for marijuana revenue. The city passed an ordinance to allow for growing and processing businesses to legally operate. Mayor Scott Matas said its already having an effect  real estate prices on vacant and dilapidated industrial parcels have skyrocketed as investors stand poised to build manufacturing sites and open nurseries. Forecasts for local marijuana taxes  which will be collected in addition to state taxes  are staggering. Desert Hot Springs current general fund is about $15 million. But city leaders project marijuana tax collections could reach $1 million next year and, eventually, climb to $50 million if all the available land gets fully built out. If the industry takes off, the revenue could be life-changing for this community, Matas said. For more on U.S. states and marijuana, see this graphic:  tmsnrt.rs/2fBzYmV Many of the California communities hoping to cash in on recreational marijuana formed their plans after meeting with David McPherson of HdL Companies, a Southern California consulting firm specializing in revenue strategies for local governments. The former Oakland tax administrator said he believes marijuana provides a rare opportunity for new job growth and tax revenue that could help struggling communities keep pace with rising pension costs and infrastructure and school funding needs. Its almost like the next dot com, he said. McPherson is working with 40 communities on marijuana issues and has helped draft a dozen local tax measures for Tuesdays ballots.  Cities have really struggled to balance their budgets, he said. This is a new industry thats going to increase significantly and create jobs and more employment in their communities.  Not all municipalities have embraced high marijuana taxes. Some said they hope to squash the black market by keeping taxes low, so legal businesses can better compete with the illicit supply. In Mendocino, a longtime marijuana-growing region in Northern California, county officials scoffed at initial projections by McPherson of up to $110 million in annual local taxes  a potential cash infusion equivalent to 60 percent of the countys general fund. Instead, the county proposed a measure with a much lower tax rate. These numbers are designed to make government drool and say,How much can we get out of our cultivators and farmers? said Jude Thilman, a Fort Bragg resident and member of the Mendocino Cannabis Policy Council at a May meeting of the Mendocino County Supervisors. The farmers are not doing that well. People are barely getting by. Nate Bradley, head of the California Cannabis Industry Association, worries that high taxes would encourage farmers to continue growing marijuana illegally. We want to pull these guys out of the hills. But if youre looking at them like theyre ATM machines, they are not going to come out of the hills. Some cities want to avoid the whole issue by banning all marijuana farming and sales within their jurisdictions, something allowed by the ballot measure.  In Orange County south of Los Angeles, Placentia Mayor Pro Tem Craig Green said the city has no plans to allow marijuana sales or cultivation. There are problems with the cannabis business, such as the increased costs to law enforcement, he said. It ends up costing more in the end. ",politicsNews,"November 5, 2016 ",1
Obama speaks up for protester but is derided by Trump,"FAYETTEVILLE, N.C.,/HERSHEY, Pa. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama chastised supporters at a rally for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in North Carolina on Friday, as tensions spiked when a supporter of Republican opponent Donald Trump began protesting. But that didnt stop Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, campaigning a few states away at the time, from telling a completely opposite version of what happened, condemning Obama for screaming at the protester. The incident happened in clear view of reporters covering the rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, where a predominantly African American crowd was jammed into a gym at a state university to hear Obama stump for Clinton. Obama had just said Trump was unfit to lead the country when he was interrupted by a white-haired white man in a beret and suit jacket with what appeared to be military patches, who stood up in the stairwell of the bleachers, waving a Trump campaign sign. The crowd turned its attention to the protester, screaming and booing at the man. Obama repeatedly told the irate crowd to focus and to settle down. Everybody sit down and be quiet for a second! Obama said. Youve got an older gentleman who is supporting his candidate, he said as the protester was led away. We live in a country that respects free speech, he said. It looks like he might have served in our military  weve got to respect that. In Trumps version, Obama scolded the protester, not the crowd. He was talking to the protester, screaming at him, really screaming at him, Trump said. By the way, if I spoke the way Obama spoke to that protester they would say, He became unhinged, Trump said.

Battleground Ohio is coveted territory in election race,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - As a perennial swing state and one that yields 18 electoral college votes, Ohio has long been coveted territory for U.S. presidential candidates who pour piles of cash every election cycle into wooing its voters. Since the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln just three presidents, and no Republican contender, have gone to the White House without winning the Buckeye State. During this years Republican party primaries, Donald Trumps pro-coal mining, anti-free trade message resonated with many of the states 7 million voters, especially in southeast Ohio communities facing high unemployment. East Liverpool, known in the 1800s as the The Crockery City where more than half the countrys ceramics were made, has fallen on hard times since the 1970s as the population dwindled and the local steel mill shut down. The town of 11,000, where almost a third of the population lives below the poverty line, has also become a center for the states problem of opiate addiction. In 2014, Ohio reported more drug overdose deaths than any state except California. This September, a photograph of two adults passed out in a car from an apparent heroin overdose, with a 4 year-old boy in the back seat, went viral on social media after it was published by police. Its the drugs, said one East Liverpool resident, Jeff Fischer, 23, standing outside a shop selling vape products. He bemoaned the lack of other activities for young people.  There is nothing to do, he said. There are drugs. That is pretty much it. Its a shame, it really is. After reports that voters in Ohios large urban areas, including the state capital Columbus, waited up to seven hours in line to vote during the 2004 presidential contest, Ohio passed a law making early in-person and absentee voting available weeks before Election Day. About one-third of eligible Ohioans, including many of the states minority groups, voted early in both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, securing wins for Democrat Barack Obama both times. This time around, more than 288,000 of the states voters had cast early ballots in person for the 2016 race as of Oct. 31, according to Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husteds office. Those numbers demonstrate a dip for Democrats of about 25 percent compared with the 2012 numbers, while registered Republican early voting has increased by more than 10 percent.  Opinion polls ahead of next Tuesdays election show Ohio is a close race between Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Democrats, however, believe higher early voting turnout by Republican voters does not automatically mean a Trump windfall, saying the increase in early voting is in urban areas dominated by moderate Republicans who may not support Trump or vote for him. The numbers overall may also be boosted by a Souls to the Polls drive that is being organized by churches, synagogues and mosques to encourage their parishioners to participate. The other big contest occupying many voters minds in recent days has been the Baseball World Series, which pitted the Chicago Cubs against Ohios Cleveland Indians. Chicago triumphed after a nail-biting game seven on Wednesday night. For some locals, it was still a welcome distraction from the responsibility of choosing the next U.S. president. According to an old Election Day saying, As Ohio goes, so does the nation. Some, of course, take that duty more seriously than others.  Im not leaning either way because I think it is a joke, to be honest with you, Fischer said. Click onreut.rs/2fn7k6m to see a related photo essay ",politicsNews,"November 4, 2016 ",1
San Diego Catholic Diocese denounces parish that called voting Democrat 'mortal sin',"(Reuters) - The Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego denounced one of its parishes on Friday after its worshippers were told that voting for Democrats is a mortal sin that could lead to an eternity in hell. The Diocese said the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in the neighborhood of Old Town made the statement in an insert to a weekly leaflet given to churchgoers on Oct. 16, calling abortion, same-sex marriage, euthanasia and other political issues non-negotiables. It is a mortal sin to vote Democrat, the insert read, with the words underlined and bolded. If your bishop, priest, deacon or other parishioners tell you to do so, you must walk away from them. Your immortal soul and your salvation are at stake. On Tuesday, voters will pick the next president after an often bitter contest that polls suggest has tightened considerably in the last week. While several states are too close to call, polls have shown Democrat Hillary Clinton leading over Republican Donald Trump for some time in California where the parish is located. Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego Bishop Robert McElroy said in a statement that the parish, which will also serve as a polling place, violated its religious duties with the political comments.  It is contrary to Catholic teaching to state that voting for a Democrat or Republican automatically condemns the voter to hell, the statement said. The Catholic Church does not endorse specific candidates, use parish media or bulletins to favor candidates or parties or engage in partisan political activity of any kind. The parishs pastor, Richard Perozich, did not respond to calls and an email on Friday. The Diocese also took issue with a column in the parishs Oct. 30 bulletin that railed against abortion and constraints on tax-exempt organizations from certain political activity, and blames elected officials for allowing U.S. society to be enslaved to sin. Satan has deceived many Christians to convert to worldly values from Christian ones, the bulletin reads. The devil does this through the tactics outlined by Saul Alinsky with the outcome as Hillary Clinton has stated, And deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed, to draw us away from Gods teachings. Alinsky was a pioneer in community organizing in Chicago known for confrontational, though nonviolent, tactics to achieve social change. Clinton has been a lifelong Methodist, attending first as child with her parents and later attending a Methodist church as first lady. Trump on the other hand has been backed by religious conservatives and evangelicals. Richard Schmalbeck, a professor at Duke University School of Law with expertise in non-profits, said the statements appear to violate requirements for tax-exempt organizations around political activity. Anything that clearly disparages a candidate is intervention in opposition to a candidate, and I think saying the devil operates through a person would count as disparagement, he said.  Schmalbeck said it seems unlikely, however, that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service would aggressively pursue revoking the churchs tax-exempt status given its recent history of not going after churches that have made similar comments.

U.S. judge bars Colorado from enforcing law banning voter 'selfies',"DENVER (Reuters) - A federal judge in Colorado blocked enforcement of a 19th-century state law that bans voters from showing a completed ballot to others, the latest in a flurry of mixed legal rulings on whether to restrict election selfies on social media. U.S. District Judge Christine Arguello in Denver issued a preliminary injunction against an 1891 Colorado statute that makes it a misdemeanor offense to reveal the contents of ones ballot. The ruling came in response to two separate lawsuits by voters challenging enforcement of the law on grounds that it violates their free-speech rights. By issuing an injunction in this case, Coloradans get what they are entitled to - clarity on an issue that implicates fundamental constitutional rights, Arguella wrote in her 26-page ruling. The controversy erupted last week after Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey reminded voters of the law, which he said would include posting your completed ballot to social media. However, prosecutors from several jurisdictions, including Denver,filed declaration with the court this week saying they would not enforce the misdemeanor law unless evidence showed that voter intimidation or coercion was involved. Based on our review of applicable law and societal changes, including the ubiquity of social media ... the District Attorneys Office would not charge anyone with an offense ... for taking a photograph or video of a completed Colorado mail-in ballot, Denver prosecutor Joseph Morales wrote. Colorado is among 18 states that have laws restricting the taking of photographs in voting booths or of completed ballots. Courts in other states and federal jurisdictions have issued mixed rulings against enforcing such bans. Federal judges in New York and California refused this week to block enforcement of state laws barring voters from taking photographs of marked ballots, saying it was too close to next Tuesdays presidential election to issue such injunctions. Colorados attorney general cited the California and New York decisions in defending Colorados law. Lawyers for the Colorado voters said the states mail-in voting system, which allows ballots to be filled out anywhere and then either mailed or dropped off, sets Colorado apart from California and New York, where voters must cast ballots at a polling place. Last month, a federal court sided with a voter who challenged a Michigan anti-selfie statute as a free-speech violation. ",politicsNews,"November 5, 2016 ",1

Clinton's charity confirms Qatar's $1 million gift while she was at State Dept,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Clinton Foundation has confirmed it accepted a $1 million gift from Qatar while Hillary Clinton was U.S. secretary of state without informing the State Department, even though she had promised to let the agency review new or significantly increased support from foreign governments. Qatari officials pledged the money in 2011 to mark the 65th birthday of Bill Clinton, Hillary Clintons husband, and sought to meet the former U.S. president in person the following year to present him the check, according to an email from a foundation official to Hillary Clintons presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta. The email, among thousands hacked from Podestas account, was published last month by WikiLeaks. Clinton signed an ethics agreement governing her familys globe-straddling foundation in order to become secretary of state in 2009. The agreement was designed to increase transparency to avoid appearances that U.S. foreign policy could be swayed by wealthy donors. If a new foreign government wished to donate or if an existing foreign-government donor, such as Qatar, wanted to increase materially its support of ongoing programs, Clinton promised that the State Departments ethics official would be notified and given a chance to raise any concerns. Clinton Foundation officials last month declined to confirm the Qatar donation. In response to additional questions, a foundation spokesman, Brian Cookstra, this week said that it accepted the $1 million gift from Qatar, but this did not amount to a material increase in the Gulf countrys support for the charity. Cookstra declined to say whether Qatari officials received their requested meeting with Bill Clinton.  Officials at Qatars embassy in Washington and in its Council of Ministers in the capital, Doha, declined to discuss the donation. The State Department has said it has no record of the foundation submitting the Qatar gift for review, and that it was incumbent on the foundation to notify the department about donations that needed attention. A department spokeswoman did not respond to additional questions about the donation. According to the foundations website, which lists donors in broad categories by cumulative amounts donated, Qatars government has directly given a total of between $1 million and $5 million over the years.  The Clinton Foundation has said it would no longer accept money from foreign governments if Clinton is elected president and would spin off those programs that are dependent on foreign governments.    Foundation officials told Reuters last year that they did not always comply with central provisions of the agreement with President Barack Obama's administration, blaming oversights in some cases.(reut.rs/2fkHPCh) At least eight other countries besides Qatar gave new or increased funding to the foundation, in most cases to fund its health project, without the State Department being informed, according to foundation and agency records. They include Algeria, which gave for the first time in 2010, and the United Kingdom, which nearly tripled its support for the foundations health project to $11.2 million between 2009 and 2012. Foundation officials have said some of those donations, including Algeria, were oversights and should have been flagged, while others, such as the UK increase, did not qualify as material increases. The foundation has declined to describe what sort of increase in funding by a foreign government would have triggered notification of the State Department for review. Cookstra said the agreement was designed to allow foreign funding for critical Clinton Foundation programs to continue without disruption.  The State Department said it has no record of being asked by the foundation to review any increases in support by a foreign government. Asked whether Qatar was funding a specific program at the foundation, Cookstra said the country supported the organizations overall humanitarian work.  Qatar continued supporting Clinton Foundation at equal or lower levels compared with the countrys pre-2009 support, he said. He declined to say if Qatar gave any money during the first three years of Clintons four-year term at the State Department, or what its support before 2009 amounted to.   In another email released by WikiLeaks, a former Clinton Foundation fundraiser said he raised more than $21 million in connection with Bill Clintons 65th birthday in 2011.  Spokesmen for Hillary Clintons campaign and Bill Clinton did not respond to emailed questions about the donation.      Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has said that major donors to the Clinton Foundation may have obtained favored access to Clintons State Department, but has provided little evidence to that effect. Clinton and her staff have dismissed this accusation as a political smear. Last month, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ordered the Donald J. Trump Foundation to stop fundraising in the state, saying it had not registered to solicit donations. ",politicsNews,"November 4, 2016 ",1
Arizona ballot-collection law put on hold until after election,"(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday put a restrictive Republican-backed Arizona ballot-collection law on hold until after Tuesdays election, handing Democrats a victory in an intensifying state-by-state legal battle over access to the polls.  Arizonas legislature earlier this year passed the law  prohibiting advocacy groups from collecting completed early ballots from voters and delivering them to election offices as part of get-out-the-vote efforts.  Plaintiffs in the case, including the Democratic National Committee, argued the law is unconstitutional because it unfairly impacted the ability of minorities to vote. Polls have shown Republican Donald Trump with a small lead in Arizona over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this week agreed to revisit a ruling that had refused to block the law and hear the case before an 11-judge panel. That panel voted 6-5 on Friday to prohibit Arizona from enforcing the law now, court records showed. Arizona filed an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court later on Friday, asking it to reverse the 9th Circuits order. Democrats have accused Republicans of enacting state laws intended to make it harder for minorities and others who tend to back Democratic candidates to cast ballots. Republicans have called these laws necessary to guard against voting fraud. Judge Sidney Thomas, the 9th Circuits chief judge, wrote that the courts action would not disrupt Arizonas ability to conduct the U.S. presidential election.  It simply would enjoin enforcement of a legislative act that would criminalize the collection, by persons other than the voter, of legitimately cast ballots, Thomas wrote. He was joined by five other judges appointed by Democratic presidents. Five dissenting 9th Circuit judges, all Republican appointees, argued that the court should not have interfered with Arizona law so close to Election Day, while early voting is already underway. The 9th Circuit covers nine Western states, including Arizona. We are disappointed in this decision as it will confuse voters and depress turnout, Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan said in a statement. A representative for the Democratic National Committee could not immediately be reached for comment. Acting in another voting case on Friday, a U.S. judge in Ohio ordered Trumps campaign not to verbally harass voters near polling places or take pictures of them in the key battleground state.

Ohio judge warns Trump campaign as voter advocates score court wins,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge in Ohio ordered Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps campaign on Friday not to intimidate voters as voting-rights advocates scored a string of last-minute victories in several politically competitive states. The ruling by U.S. District Court Judge James Gwin creates the possibility of fines or jail time for Trump allies who harass voters, a significant victory for Democrats who had worried the real-estate mogul was encouraging supporters to cause mayhem at the polls on Nov. 8. The ruling also deals a blow to a Trump-aligned exit poll that seeks to mobilize thousands of supporters. The Trump campaign appealed the decision. On the campaign trail, Trump has warned that the election may be rigged and has called on supporters to keep an eye on voting activity for possible signs of fraud in large cities.  Democrats have launched a legal blitz in Ohio and five other battleground states to prevent that from happening. They are also trying to stop a paramilitary group, the Oath Keepers, from conducting its own monitoring operation.  Numerous studies have found that U.S. voter fraud is exceedingly rare. Voting-rights advocates also won legal victories in three other states on Friday, building on a string of decisions that have rolled back election restrictions across the country. In Arizona, a federal judge suspended a state law that prohibits advocates ability to collect absentee ballots. Having more options to turn in your ballot ensures that more people take part in the democratic process, said Spencer Scharff, voter protection director of the Arizona Democratic Party. In North Carolina, a judge ordered election officials to restore the voting rights of thousands who had been removed from registration lists in recent weeks. And in Kansas, a state court blocked a dual-registration system that would have prevented 20,000 registered voters from casting ballots for local offices because they were unable to prove U.S. citizenship. The Ohio ruling does not prevent the state Republican Party from sending trained volunteers into polling places to make sure election laws are being followed.  However, it does impose restrictions on Trump supporters who take it on themselves to monitor voting activity, saying they may not interrogate voters within 100 feet of a polling place, block them from entering, or photograph them as they come and go.  Many of those activities are already illegal, but the judges order means that anybody who engages in them could be held in contempt of court, exposing them to additional civil or criminal penalties. It backs the law with the power of contempt, said Rick Hasen, an election-law expert at the University of California at Irvine. The order also deals a blow to a Trump-allied exit poll that aims to mobilize supporters to canvass voters in an effort to sniff out instances of voter manipulation. The organizer of that effort, Republican operative Roger Stone, told Reuters he would fight the ruling regardless of the outcome of the election. The Democrats lawyers have perjured themselves and perpetrated a fraud before the court, he wrote in a text message. The order also applies to Democrats, who have focused their efforts on making sure their supporters can vote. With this decision, Ohioans can feel confident that they will be able to make their voices heard in this election, Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said in a prepared statement. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. ",politicsNews,"November 4, 2016 ",1

Kansas judge strikes state's dual voter registration system,"(Reuters) - A state judge on Friday struck down a Kansas voter registration system that would have prevented people from voting in state and local elections unless they show proof of U.S. citizenship. The judge ruled that the loss of voting rights for more than 18,000 Kansas residents far outweighs the risk posed by potential voter fraud, as the state mentioned only about two dozen people who may have attempted to improperly register to vote over the last 13 years. The right of citizen suffrage forms the foundation of a democratic society, Larry Hendricks, District Judge in Shawnee County, wrote in a 19-page ruling. Whenever the laws of a state and the federal government clash with respect to this right, cracks are bound to appear in the framework of democracy. Kansas has had one of the strictest voter identification statutes in the United States, making the state a symbol for mostly Republican Party supporters who say the rules are meant to prevent voter fraud. Opponents, mostly Democrats, say the rules discriminate against minorities. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach said by phone on Friday he planned to appeal the ruling adding, I regard the decision as wrong ... and this decision stands in the way of protecting our elections. The American Civil Liberties Unions lawsuit said the voter registration system established by Kobach violated the states constitution and state law and called it two-tiered.  This ruling is a victory for Kansas voters and a stinging rebuke of Secretary Kobachs repeated efforts to improperly use his authority toobstruct their access to the ballot, ACLU Voting Rights Project staff attorney Sophia Lakin said in a statement. The ACLU said the system would have denied the right to vote in state and local elections to residents who registered through a federal voter registration form or when they applied for or renewed their drivers license. Under the rejected system, those people could have voted in federal elections but would have had to show proof of citizenship to vote in state and local ones. The system required registrants to prove their citizenship by providing one of a series of documents, including birth certificates and passports.  Kobach has gained a reputation for pushing a series of voting and anti-immigration measures as a national debate over voting restrictions has accelerated since the Supreme Court struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act in 2013.

North Carolina Republican office painted with anti-Trump message," (Editors note: Attention to language in the second paragraph that some readers may find offensive.) (Reuters) - A local North Carolina Republican headquarters was spray-painted with an anti-Donald Trump message early on Friday, the second time in a month that a party office in the state has been defaced. A vandal sprayed the door and walls of the Alamance County Republican Party headquarters in Burlington with the words Fuck Trump and painted over the word Republican on a sign at the office at about 2 a.m. local time, according to Chris Verdeck, assistant police chief in the city. No arrests have been made in the incident, which was caught on surveillance video footage, Verdeck said in a phone interview. The vandalism in Burlington, which is located about 20 miles east of Greensboro, occurred four days before the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday. The contest between Republican candidate Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has been one of the most bitterly fought presidential campaigns in years. Police released a still image from the surveillance video of the vandal, who appeared to be a young man with a light complexion and dark hair wearing a light-colored hooded sweatshirt. The man appeared to have acted alone, Verdeck said. This is deeply troubling to ourAlamance County GOP members and volunteers, but even more so, this is troubling for our nation, Alamance County Republican Party Chairman Ben York said in a statement. It is my hope that we can be an example to the world that this behavior is unacceptable and it will not deter us from the noble responsibilitywe have to live andvote in the freedom that has been given to us.  Last month, the Orange County Republican Partys office in Hillsborough, which sits about 25 miles east of Burlington, was set on fire and a graffiti message left nearby said leave town or else.  Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Trumps vice presidential running mate, called the Hillsborough incident political terrorism. North Carolina is considered one of the battleground states in the election, with its likely outcome unknown, giving it the chance to play a decisive role in the Electoral College vote that ultimately decides the presidency. Democratic establishments have also been targeted in the run-up to the election, which has been distinguished by vitriol and sometimes violent acts hurled between Republicans and Democrats. Earlier this week, a historic black church in Greenville, Mississippi, was burned and spray-painted with Vote Trump. Black churches in the U.S. South have long been a base of support for the Democratic Party. ",politicsNews,"November 4, 2016 ",1
Insight: Emails show how Republicans lobbied to limit voting hours in North Carolina," (This version of the November 3 story officially corrects paragraph 13 to read Chapel Hill, instead of Raleigh. The White House initially misidentified Obamas location in a transcript of his remarks) By Julia Harte ASHEBORO, N.C. (Reuters) - When Bill McAnulty, an elections board chairman in a mostly white North Carolina county, agreed in July to open a Sunday voting site where black church members could cast ballots after services, the reaction was swift: he was labeled a traitor by his fellow Republicans. I became a villain, quite frankly, recalled McAnulty at a state board of elections meeting in September that had been called to resolve disputes over early voting plans.I got accused of being a traitor and everything else by the Republican Party, McAnulty said. Following the blowback from Republicans, McAnulty later withdrew his support for the Sunday site. In an interview with Reuters, he said he ultimately ruled against opening the Sunday voting site in Randolph County because he had made a mistake in reading the wishes of the voters. He declined to discuss the episode further. This years highly charged presidential contest between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump has stoked accusations by both parties of political meddling in the scheduling of early voting hours in North Carolina, a coveted battleground state with a history of tight elections. In emails, state and county Republican officials lobbied  members of at least 17 county election boards to keep early-voting sites open for shorter hours on weekends and in evenings  times that usually see disproportionately high turnout by Democratic voters. Reuters obtained the emails through a public records request. The officials also urged county election boards to open fewer sites for residents to cast ballots during early voting that began on Oct. 20 and ends on Saturday. Civil rights advocates and Democrats launched their own campaigns for expanded early voting hours.  The tug-of-war yielded mixed results. The state did ultimately add nearly 5,900 more hours and 78 more sites to vote early than in 2012. But several counties  opened only one polling site during the first week of early voting, slightly denting turnout across the state. Voter turnout dropped by 20 percent in the counties that had multiple polling sites during the first week of early voting in 2012 but just one site during the first week in 2016. We currently have more early voting locations and hours open than ever were open under Democrat control, said North Carolina Republican Party executive director DallasWoodhouse, denying his party was trying to suppress the Democratic vote. President Barack Obama praised the expanded early voting opportunities during an election stop in North Carolina on Wednesday. Those who wanted to suppress the vote, theyre going to fail, he said at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in Chapel Hill. Right now, there are more one-stop early vote sites in North Carolina than ever before.  Counties that Obama, a Democrat, won in 2012 increased their Sunday hours this year by 16 percent, while counties that voted for his Republican rival, Mitt Romney, decreased them by nearly a quarter, the records show. State Republican officials say keeping polls open during evenings and weekends, or off-hour times, drains county resources. In two emails, on Aug. 11 and Aug. 14, Woodhouse urged Republicans serving on county election boards to follow the party line on curtailing the early voting period.  Many of our folks are angry and opposed to Sunday voting, he wrote. Six days of voting in one week is enough. Period. Keeping polling sites open for the full 17-day early voting period may be wasteful and unnecessary, he added.  Woodhouses emails were subsequently published by local media, but he was not alone in lobbying to limit voting hours, the Reuters review of public records shows. The review counted similar emails from at least four other Republican Party officials to election boards, each of which is composed of two Republicans and one Democrat. The same day that Woodhouse sent his Aug. 11 email, Elaine Hewitt, a member of the Rowan County Republican Executive Committee, sent the county elections board two proposed schedules for early voting, both of which included just one site for the first four days and no sites on Sundays.  With all of the opportunities to vote by mail, early in person Monday - Saturday, and on Election Day, there is no justification for requiring election workers to work on Sundays, she wrote.  Garry Terry, the chairman of the Republican Party for North Carolinas First Congressional District, sent an email on Aug. 13 to elections board members in his region, reminding them to act in the best interest of the Republican Party by opposing Sunday voting and restricting early voting to one location. Hewitt and Terry did not respond to requests for comment. Woodhouse defended the actions of the Republican officials, telling Reuters that Republican opposition to Sunday voting was not discriminatory but was rather based on the belief that people should not be required to work on Sundays. The Sunday polling site that McAnulty first supported and then opposed would have been located at the Randolph County Board of Elections office and would have cost around $1,000 to operate, according to the office director. If its not wasteful and it allows more people to vote... the board has historically been for that, Margaret Megerian, the Democratic member of board, told Reuters. In contrast with the Republicans email campaign, the Democratic push to expand early voting hours has largely taken shape in public forums. In Democratic-leaning Guilford County, the states third largest, a county board of elections meeting on Aug. 8 attracted about 75 people after word spread that the board was planning to halve the number of early voting sites, from 24 in 2012. The Rev. Nelson Johnson said in an interview that the proposal by the boards Republican chairwoman would prevent voting especially by people who cant easily take time off and said it absolutely had a racial intent. Johnson, who is African American, leads a community center in Greensboro, North Carolina. Board Chairwoman Kathryn Lindley told Reuters she believed a lesser number of sites would cause less confusion about which places were going to be open, and that it was ludicrous to think her suggested plan had been discriminatory. The board ultimately agreed to 25 early voting sites and one day of Sunday voting before the November election. Johnson said the decision was a significant triumph. Lindley said Johnsons group had no influence on the final outcome. Guilfords plan also included one restriction that particularly angered Democrats. In the first week of early voting in 2012, residents could vote at 16 sites. This year, that has been reduced to one.  Mary Cranford, 52, a registered Republican, was fourth in line on the first day of early voting in Guilford. She was able to vote but said she was upset that only one site was open for the first week. She said she voted for Clinton this year. I cant believe whats been done to keep some people from voting in this state, she said. Just 7,916 people voted in the first week of early voting in Guilford this year, compared to 60,732 in 2012, according to state elections board records. The general counsel for Clintons campaign and other plaintiffs filed a court motion on Oct. 1 demanding Guilford and four other North Carolina counties expand their early voting opportunities. The court denied it, saying that changing the early voting plans would create logistical difficulties. ",politicsNews,"November 3, 2016 ",1
"School, infrastructure bond measures fill U.S. ballots","CHICAGO/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. voters on Tuesday will decide the fate of $70.3 billion of municipal bond issuance, the largest amount of borrowing requests in a decade, with much of it earmarked to help pay for fixing the nations crumbling infrastructure. The biggest concentration of bonds hanging in the balance  is in California, which accounts for nearly 60 percent of the total. Nationwide, the state, school and local government bond measures, 682 in total, would fund building and repairing schools, mass transit and roads, and even biomedical research in one state, according to data company Ipreo. To view the historical amount of bond ballot measures, click on tmsnrt.rs/2e9Z5bb. The governments will be able to take advantage of still-low borrowing costs and a stable economy, even when considering the possibility of an increase in historically low benchmark interest rates by the Federal Reserve in December. This year, the finances at the state level look better. Weve had more stability in revenues and more stability in the economy as a whole, so we would expect a substantial amount of these proposals to be accepted, said Philip Fischer, municipal research strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Yields on top-rated 10 and 30-year bonds hit all-time lows in July on the U.S. municipal markets benchmark scale. While yields have risen since then they remain attractive for state and local government borrowers. California ballots are bursting with 195 bond measures totaling $41.7 billion, including the biggest nationwide  $9 billion of state general obligation debt to finance new construction and modernization for K-12 and charter schools and community colleges. Another California ballot measure is aimed at reining in debt by requiring statewide voter approval for revenue bonds exceeding $2 billion for projects financed, owned, or managed by the state.  Opponents of the initiative, called Proposition 53, say mandating voter approval would delay critical infrastructure projects.  The drought over the past four years has highlighted the need for infrastructure in California, said David Guy, Northern California Water Association president, at a September panel on California propositions. We dont need another hurdle to progress in California. While school and infrastructure financing are dominant themes this election, a measure on Montanas statewide ballot would create a biomedical research authority funded by $200 million of bonds over 10 years. Voters will also be weighing 154 state-wide measures, including bonds, taxes, gun control and the minimum wage, in 35 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.  In several states, voters will be deciding whether to increase various sales, income, property, cigarette and other taxes.  For example, in Colorado there is a proposed constitutional amendment calling for a public option universal healthcare payment system, funded by a new 10 percent state payroll tax. Employers would cover two-thirds and employees one-third of the cost, according to the citizen-led initiative known as Amendment 69. Washington state voters will weigh the nations first tax on carbon emissions, while five states, including California, seek to legalize and tax recreational marijuana. Oregon voters will consider changing the corporate tax code to collect revenue equivalent to one-third of the states general fund expenditures. The legislature would decide how to use the proceeds.  Eno Center for Transportation, a nonprofit think tank, reported that voters will decide tax and bond measures for roads, seaports, railroads, airports and mass transit that would raise an estimated $250 billion for specified projects over a period of years during which specific taxes would be collected. These include $3.5 billion of bonds to repair and improve the San Francisco areas BART transit system, a regional property tax hike to raise $3.1 billion over 20 years for mass transit in the Detroit area and $70 million of bonds to improve Rhode Islands seaport. Kerry OHare, vice president of Building Americas Future, a bipartisan coalition on infrastructure investment, said the dearth of reliable long-term federal transportation funding has left a void that state and local governments are trying to address via ballot measures. At the state and local level, its Listen, we need to step up and raise money for transportation needs, she said. ",politicsNews,"November 4, 2016 ",1
Factbox: Governorships up for grabs in 12 states,"(Reuters) - Republicans and Democrats will battle in a dozen U.S. states that will hold elections for governor on Tuesday, and many of the races could be close calls.  Drawing national attention because of a debate over transgender rights, Republican Governor Pat McCrory is seeking a second term against Roy Cooper, a Democrat who has been the states attorney general since 2001. Polls show Cooper with a modest lead in a state that also has competitive races for president and the U.S. Senate.  In one of the years closest gubernatorial races, polls put Republican former Navy SEAL Eric Greitens in a dead heat with Democrat Chris Koster, the states attorney general. They are bidding to succeed Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat who has served the maximum two terms in office.  Indiana Governor Mike Pence, who initially sought re-election, withdrew from the gubernatorial race in July to campaign as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps running mate. Lieutenant Governor Eric Holcomb, a Republican, stepped in for Pence and will compete against Democrat John Gregg, a former state lawmaker. Gregg narrowly leads Holcomb, according to polls. Democratic businessman Jim Justice leads Republican state Senate President Bill Cole in polls, though data is sparse. Democratic Governor Earl Ray Tomblin was barred by term limits from running again.  Democratic GovernorSteve Bullock is battling Republican tech entrepreneur Greg Gianforte to keep his seat. A poll conducted last month by Mason-DixonPolling and Research put Bullock ahead of Gianforte 47 percent to 45 percent.  Democrat Colin Van Ostern has a modest lead over Republican Chris Sununu in recent polls. Both are members of the states Executive Council, which helps to administer state government, and are seeking to succeed Democratic Governor Maggie Hassan, who is running for the U.S. Senate. The term is two years.  Republican Lieutenant Governor Phil Scott and Democrat Sue Minter, a former state transportation secretary, are vying to succeed retiring Governor Peter Shumlin, a Democrat. One poll last month gave Scott a seven-point lead, while another showed a dead heat. The term is two years.  Democratic Governor Kate Brown is favored against Republican Bud Pierce, an oncologist. Brown was sworn in last year after her predecessor, John Kitzhaber, resigned in scandal. The election is for the final two years of Kitzhabers term. Polls put incumbent Governor Gary Herbert, a Republican, at an advantage over Democrat Mike Weinholtz, a healthcare executive, in Utah. Herbert, who took office in 2009 after his predecessor, Jon Huntsman, resigned, is seeking a second full term.  Democratic Governor Jay Inslee is widely favored in the polls to win a second term against Republican Bill Bryant, a businessman and former commissioner of the Port of Seattle.  Republican Doug Burgum, a former Microsoft Corp executive, is expected to defeat Democratic State Representative Marvin Nelson in the solid Republican state of North Dakota. Governor Jack Dalrymple, a Republican who was eligible to run for re-election in 2016, declined to seek another term. Democrat John Carney, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, had a wide lead in a University of Delware poll last month against Republican Colin Bonini, a state senator. Democratic Governor Jack Markell is prohibited by term limits from running for re-election to the position he has held since 2009. ",politicsNews,"November 4, 2016 ",1
Madrid Wax Museum unveils clay busts of Clinton and Trump,"MADRID (Reuters) - The Madrid Wax Museum on Friday unveiled clay busts of U.S. presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump as they gear up for Tuesdays vote, waiting to hear who the winner will be before creating their full-body wax replica. The busts of the Democrat and Republican candidates have been placed on either side of a wax figure of outgoing President Barack Obama at the museum in the Spanish capital. The museum traditionally, as it has done with candidates in Spain, France or Russia and also Britain, always makes the (clay replicas of the) presidential hopefuls, Gonzalo Presa, head of communications at the museum, said.

"U.S. bolsters cyber defense for election, few new steps on violence","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal and state authorities are beefing up cyber defenses against potential electronic attacks on voting systems ahead of U.S. elections on Nov. 8, but few are taking new steps to guard against possible civil unrest or violence. The threat of computer hacking and the potential for violent clashes is darkening an already rancorous presidential race between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, amid fears that Russia or other actors could spread political misinformation online or perhaps tamper with voting. To counter the cyber threat, all but two U.S. states have accepted help from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to probe and scan voter registration and election systems for vulnerabilities, a department official told Reuters. Ohio has asked a cyber protection unit of the National Guard, a reserve force within the U.S. military, for assistance to protect the states systems. On Thursday, Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan and her cyber security team met with officials from the FBI and the DHS, in addition to state-level agencies, to discuss cyber threats, said Matt Roberts, a spokesman for Reagan. The National Governors Association on Friday said election officials were well prepared for possible cyber threats and had been confronting them for over a decade. We remain confident that any technical problems on Election Night will not undermine the overall integrity of the process, the association said in a statement. Unidentified intelligence officials told NBC News on Thursday there is no specific warning about an Election Day attack, but they remain concerned hackers from Russia or elsewhere may try to disrupt the process, likely by spreading misinformation through social media sites. The potential for violence around the election has loomed in the background of the campaign for months. Armed groups around the country have pledged in unprecedented numbers to monitor voting sites for signs of election fraud. Federal officials have warned authorities in New York, Texas and Virginia about an unspecific threat of attacks by the al Qaeda militant group around Election Day, putting local law enforcement on alert before Tuesdays vote. A U.S. government source in Washington said some federal agencies sent bulletins to local and state officials flagging the information but that the threat was relatively low level. We are continuing with the high level of patrols at all of our facilities that we have had in place for some time now, said spokesman Steve Coleman of the Port Authority, which operates airports, tunnels and bridges around the area. Voter intimidation reported at polling sites so far prompted Democrats to accuse Trump of a campaign of vigilante voter intimidation in four states on Monday. But local authorities surveyed by Reuters on Thursday in five states - Ohio, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Wisconsin and Florida - said they were not increasing election-related law enforcement personnel or resources above 2012 levels. The FBI, which designates one special agent from each of its 56 field offices for election crime matters, has not increased its numbers or given staff additional training this year, said an FBI spokeswoman. There has been no substantive change in the number of personnel deployed by the rest of the Justice Department, which designates Assistant U.S. Attorneys and federal prosecutors within the agencys Public Integrity Section to handle election crimes, according to a spokesman. Jim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, which represents hundreds of thousands of U.S. officers, said cops are taking the same security measures they would take for any large event. He said he expects the vows by militias to monitor the polls to be a lot of talk, little action. ",politicsNews,"November 4, 2016 ",1
"Soda taxes may spread if voters check ballots in California, Colorado","NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Americans vote for a new president on Tuesday, hundreds of thousands of voters in Californias Bay Area and Boulder, Colorado, will also decide whether they want levies on sugary drinks, another step toward making soda taxes a norm. Three cities in California - San Francisco, Berkeley and Albany - and Boulder, Colorado, have become the latest battleground in a so-called War on Sugar that centers on sweetened drinks. Over 800,000 voters will decide on ballot measures to introduce taxes of 1 or 2 cents per ounce on soft drinks on Nov. 9, just weeks after the World Health Organization (WHO) advocated that governments should impose these types of levies.  The push for taxes on sugar and sodas has gathered momentum this year, as officials and health advocates seek ways to stem health epidemics of diabetes and obesity. On most ballots, the tax would not apply to diet sodas but does affect some juices, sports drinks and other beverages with added sugar. Reducing consumption of sugary drinks is seen as a relatively easy way for people to cut down on added sugars, recommended by groups including the WHO, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the American Heart Association. The trend has prompted worry and millions of dollars in advertising and lobbying campaigns from beverage industry giants like PepsiCo Inc and Coca-Cola Co that are facing declining sales of their flagship products in markets including the United States.  So far this year, Britain and Philadelphia decided to introduce levies on soft drinks and countries including South Africa have proposed similar measures. This follows a decision by Mexico to introduce such a tax in 2014. The broadening of these efforts raises the prospect of establishing them as the norm after numerous previous attempts failed, advocates say. The more these taxes pass, the more they will be considered in other jurisdictions, said Jim OHara, health promotion policy director with the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington. Both Pepsi and Coke have are increasing options for less sugary drinks, responding to changing consumer tastes. Consumption of carbonated soft drinks hit a 30-year low in the United States last year, as water sales continued their climb, according to Beverage Digest. The majority of California voters support government measure to reduce consumption of sugary beverages, according to a Field Poll released in February. In San Francisco, a 2014 bid for a similar tax failed to pass a two-thirds vote, but is expected by many to succeed this time around, as only a simple majority is required. The votes in the other cities are expected by both advocates and opponents alike to be tighter. Fighting for survival, Big Soda has been outspending advocates of the measure, but not by much. Industry spending to oppose the taxes this year in the Bay Area alone has swelled to around $27 million to $28 million, versus around some $19 million by advocates, according to estimates from both sides. Billionaires including Michael Bloomberg have joined the fray, contributing $15 million to pro-tax campaigns in the Bay Area. The former mayor of New York waged an unsuccessful campaign in the city to cut soda sizes in 2014. Opponents say the tax, which would be levied on distributors, is unfairly targeted at drinks makers and could raise food costs beyond just soda. In effect, this is a grocery tax. It could be spread out on many items by distributors, said Joe Arellano, spokesman for the No Grocery Tax campaigns in Californias Bay area.  In the California cities, the measures would introduce a penny-per-ounce tax. In Boulder, it would be 2 cents. Theres no tax we will support to change behavior of consumers. We dont think they work, said Susan Neely, head of the American Beverage Association. She cited efforts by soda companies like reducing portion sizes. The group is suing to block Philadelphias tax. She said it was unclear yet if the group would challenge the potential levies in California or Colorado. It is unclear how long-lasting the impacts of the taxes in places like Mexico and Berkeley will be, but some early research suggests partial pass-through of the taxes from businesses to customers and an impact on per capita consumption.

Battle over bathrooms looms large in North Carolina governor's race,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - In a year of police shooting protests, historic hurricane flooding and voting rights clashes in North Carolina, it is the battle over bathrooms that could prove pivotal in the Tar Heel states gubernatorial race. The election will effectively serve as a referendum on a state law that bans transgender people from using government-run restrooms that match their gender identity and limits protections for gays and lesbians. Signed by Republican Governor Pat McCrory in March, the law has been blamed for hundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses and the relocation of major sporting events from the ninth largest U.S. state. Opponents of the law say the vote on Tuesday also could have national implications. If McCrory loses to Democratic challenger Roy Cooper, they said, elected officials backing such measures in other states will face greater political risk.  I believe a strong message already has been sent to lawmakers across the country, said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, the nations largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) civil rights organization. I believe and hope on Election Day that an even stronger message will be sent. The advocacy group has joined with Equality North Carolina for a broad effort to boost voter turnout and unseat McCrory and other supporters of the law known as House Bill 2. The organizations are targeting about 400,000 pro-equality voters in the state, including an estimated 255,800 LGBT voters, Griffin said. The Human Rights Campaign said that voting bloc could make a difference in a presidential swing state where Democrat Barack Obama won by about 14,000 votes in 2008 and Republican Mitt Romney led by about 92,000 votes in 2012. Theres no question this is going to be a very close race at the top of the ticket, and the LGBTQ voting bloc really has the ability to impact the outcome of this election, said Chris Sgro, executive director of Equality North Carolina. RACE A TOSS-UP Elections experts consider the race between McCrory and Cooper, one of 12 U.S. gubernatorial seats being decided on Tuesday, to be among the countrys most competitive.  Public opinion polls have been tight most of the year, though the RealClearPolitics average of recent surveys shows Cooper with a slight advantage. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll found that, among residents who expect to vote, 38 percent were less likely to support McCrorys re-election bid as a result of the law and its fallout, compared with 32 percent who were more likely to support him. The poll was conducted online in English between Oct. 6 and Oct. 19. It included 1,233 likely voters and had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. Other polls have shown a majority of residents believe the law is hurting the state. McCrory, who in 2012 became North Carolinas first Republican governor in two decades, has blamed the backlash against the law on national groups trying to redefine gender and basic norms of privacy. Cooper says the law is discriminatory, and he has made McCrorys support for it a central issue of his campaign. An ad campaign launched last week by the conservative NC Values Coalition accuses Cooper, the states attorney general since 2001, of putting women and children at risk by refusing to defend H.B. 2. By not defending it, hes allowing men into womens bathrooms, the groups executive director, Tami Fitzgerald, said in a phone interview. We think that just goes too far. Equality NC and HRC have made North Carolina ground zero for their radical LGBT agenda, she added. But I believe that their efforts will fail. At early voting sites in North Carolina this week, the issue appeared to be galvanizing people on both sides. I admire McCrory for standing behind H.B. 2, said Republican Parker Umstead, 81, a certified public accountant who cast a ballot in Winston-Salem for the incumbent. It takes courage to stand up for your beliefs. But Holly Carpenter, a 41-year-old Republican from Cary who works in the medical field, cited the measure as the prime reason why she voted against McCrory, whom she supported in 2012. To lose so many economic opportunities over that was just a huge negative for me, she said. ",politicsNews,"November 4, 2016 ",1
"Battered U.S. coal industry hopes for Trump, prepares for Clinton","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has won over the U.S. coal industry by promising to revive the downtrodden sector and scrap regulations if elected.      But the industry has a Plan B if the New York businessman loses to his more green-minded Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on Tuesday: carbon capture and storage, a technology that captures carbon dioxide from burning coal and injects it underground, where many scientists are optimistic it cannot contribute to global warming. Coal backers see CCS as a politically feasible solution that could help the next president thread the needle between environmentalists and a once-powerful business that is in desperate need of a lifeline. They have been pushing both major party candidates to embrace it. Staff at the National Enhanced Oil Recovery Initiative held separate teleconferences with the Clinton and Trump campaigns in August on the merits of a bill that would extend and raise tax breaks for coal and other fossil fuel companies doing CCS in oilfields, from $10 per ton of carbon stored to $35 a ton. NEORI is made up of diverse groups ranging from environmental ogranizations to some of the countrys largest coal companies. Weeks after the teleconference, Clinton announced her support for the bipartisan CCS bill. Nearly 20 of 100 senators, including Clintons vice presidential running mate Tim Kaine, also back it and expect it to gain momentum.      Trump has not given a position on the bill, but a senior policy adviser to Trumps campaign, Dan Kowalski, said he supports all sources of American energy. This includes clean coal and research into new coal technologies.  My sense is Clinton recognizes that, especially in certain parts of the country, coal-based energy and other fossil fuels provide some of the highest-paying jobs in our economy, said Brad Crabtree, of the Great Plains Institute, a policy group that pushes for the deployment technologies to reduce fossil fuel emissions, and the parent organization of NEORI. Oil drillers have used CCS since the 1970s, pumping carbon dioxide into aging reservoirs to force out remaining crude. Coal advocates want to expand CCS to coal-fueled power plants. But the business is expensive and needs incentives. Trumps anti-regulation stance has made him a clear favorite of the industry, because it suggests lower costs and risks for major producers like Arch Coal Inc, Peabody Energy Corp, Cloud Peak Energy Inc and Alpha Natural Resources Inc. The sector has given about $223,000 in support of Trump, compared with none for Clinton, according to a Reuters analysis of contributions over $200 made by several of the biggest coal companies and their employees. Coal faces a potentially starker future under Clinton. She has promised to build on Democratic President Barack Obamas disputed Clean Power Plan to curb carbon output and suffered political damage earlier this year when she said that by doing so were going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.       Those jobs are already quickly evaporating.  The industry now employs only about 65,000 miners across states like West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Wyoming, down from around 91,000 in 2011, according to the most recent statistics from the U.S. Department of Energy. The countrys top two biggest coal companies, Arch and Peabody Energy, this year filed for bankruptcy. Neither Trump scrapping federal regulations nor the expanded use of CCS will likely restore the sector, where production last year dropped to the lowest level since 1986, to its previous heights. Coal <NYM/QL> faces a dual headwind of both a global push for cleaner energy such as wind and solar power, and drilling technology that has made its competitor natural gas abundant - and cheap. Jeff Holmstead, a Republican lobbyist at Bracewell Law, said if Clinton wins, much of coals fate in coming years could be determined in the first 30 to 60 days. By then it should be known whether she appoints staunch environmentalists at departments including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior. But he is confident that Clinton would work with industry on CCS and allow coal to play a role in the future in the U.S. power sector.      Elizabeth Gore, a Democrat who lobbies with Brownstein, Hyatt, Farber and Schreck for a coal-burning cooperative said coal companies must find the marginal changes they can make to buy themselves some time, to provide more of a soft landing.

Democrats face growing concerns as White House race tightens,"CONCORD, N.C./WINTERVILLE, N.C. (Reuters) - Hillary Clintons supporters nervously eyed opinion polls showing the Democrat with a tenuous lead over Republican rival Donald Trump on Thursday as the White House candidates raced through vital battleground states in a late search for votes. The race for the Oval Office has tightened significantly in the past week, as several swing states that Trump must win  shifted from favoring Clinton to toss-ups, according to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project. The project, a survey of about 15,000 people every week in all 50 states plus Washington, D.C., found the two candidates were now tied in Florida and North Carolina and that Clintons lead in Michigan had narrowed so much the state was too close to call. Ohio remained a dead heat, with Pennsylvania now tilting to Clinton. A Reuters/Ipsos national daily tracking poll found on Wednesday that Clinton was leading Trump by 6 percentage points, the same advantage she held before FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress last week saying the agency had found a new cache of emails potentially related to its probe of Clinton emails. Other polls have shown a far closer race, fueling Democratic worries about the state of the race just five days before Tuesdays election. Clintons national lead over Trump eroded to 3 percentage points among likely voters in a New York Times/CBS News poll on Thursday, down from 9 points just two weeks ago. An average of polls compiled by the RealClearPolitics website also showed her lead at 1.7 percentage points on Thursday, well down from the solid advantage she had until late last month. Im worried that Trump may win, said Nancy Dubs, 83, a retiree in Pittsburgh, who said she was voting for Clinton. I think its maybe time to have a female president. For Clinton supporters, it has been a quick shift from confidence to anxiety. I think all of us are a little bit nervous, said Rajnandini Pillai, a professor at California State University at San Marcos, who plans to back Clinton. It seemed pretty much in the bag a couple weeks ago. Nevertheless, some polls showed Clinton recovering slightly from her slide in the past week. She has maintained her comfortable edge in the Reuters/Ipsos poll and inched back into a 2-point lead over Trump in the latest Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll, which had shown Clinton falling slightly behind Trump earlier this week. President Barack Obama, on the third day of a multi-state campaign trek for Clinton, adopted a sense of urgency before a raucous crowd at Florida International University. You have the chance to shape history, Obama said. There are times where history is ... moveable. Where you can make things better or worse. This is one of those moments. The tightening White House race has rattled financial markets as investors weigh a possible Trump victory. Investors have generally seen Clinton as the candidate who would maintain the status quo, while there is more market uncertainty over what a Trump presidency might mean in terms of economic policy, free trade and geopolitics. Global equity prices drifted lower on Thursday as worries about the election weighed on investor sentiment. With the White House race decided on the Electoral College system of tallying wins on a state-by-state basis, Clinton and Trump are focused on a handful of battleground states. Trump began the day in Florida before heading to North Carolina for two rallies. Clinton was in North Carolina for two rallies. Florida and North Carolina are both must-win states for Trump as he tries to piece together the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the White House. Clinton, who has comfortable leads in big states such as California and New York, could more easily reach 270 votes without winning either Florida or North Carolina. In Florida, Trump pressed his argument that the controversy over Clintons use of a private server for her email when she was U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 was part of a pattern of corruption that made her unfit for the White House. Comey concluded at the end of a year-long FBI probe in July that there were no grounds to bring any charges. His brief letter advising Congress last Friday about the agency reviewing newly discovered emails said they might or might not be significant, but the news was seized on by Trump and other Republicans. Republicans in Congress have already vowed to lead investigations of Clintons email practices and her family charitable foundation. She is likely to be under investigation for many, many years. Also likely to conclude in a criminal trial, Trump said in Jacksonville.  At a later rally in Concord, North Carolina, he said that the political leadership at the Justice Department was trying to protect Clinton. Trumps wife, Melania, tried to bolster his standing with women during her first campaign-trail appearance, in a Philadelphia suburb. We must win on Nov. 8 and we must come together as Americans. We must treat each other with respect and kindness even when we disagree, she said in Berwyn, Pennsylvania. Trump, a New York businessman who has never previously run for political office, has called for a ban on Muslims entering the country, launched his campaign by calling illegal immigrants from Mexico rapists and was captured in a 2005 video that surfaced last month boasting of groping women and making other unwanted advances. At a campaign rally in Winterville, North Carolina, a community where more than a third of the population is African-American, Clinton asked the crowd to imagine life under a Trump presidency. He has spent this campaign offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters, she said. I just dont believe were at our best when we stoke fear about each other.

"Amid election jitters, many big funds stay aggressive but cash tempts","BOSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Stocks are listing, bonds are drifting and suddenly gold is back in vogue. Global investors appear to be facing the prospect that next weeks U.S. presidential election may not play out as they have been expecting. Until last Friday, when the FBI said it had re-opened a probe of Democrat Hillary Clintons use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, the prevailing view among the investment set had her coasting to victory. And most investors have said in surveys they were more comfortable with that outcome than a victory by Republican Donald Trump. Now, though, several polls depict an ever-tightening race as the clock counts down to Election Day on Tuesday, although the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Clinton still with a 6-point lead. Investors generally see Clinton as a known quantity who would not make major changes that would upend financial markets, while Trumps positions have been difficult to nail down. Yet against the tumultuous political backdrop, some of the biggest American stock funds remain either too sanguine, too confused or too focused on extending the bull market to guard against an Election Day result that could shock the world like the Brexit vote did in June. U.S. large-cap mutual funds, which oversee $4 trillion in assets, are heading into the showdown for the White House with only a thin layer of cash to absorb any potential shocks from the stock market.  Gerry Sullivan, who runs USA Mutuals $234 million Barrier Fund, said it would be hard to reposition his portfolio even if he knew the election results ahead of time.  There is so much confusion, Sullivan said. U.S. funds that invest in stocks with large market capitalizations are not showing any drastic moves toward precaution. Overall, they have only 3.1 percent of their assets dedicated to cash, according to the latest data from Morningstar Inc. These same funds held more cash, about 3.4 percent, before Barack Obama defeated John McCain in 2008. Multi-asset investors are more defensively positioned, especially those outside the United States, according to the latest Reuters asset allocation poll. Funds in Europe held 8.1 percent of their portfolios in cash in late October, while U.K.-based funds had some 9.6 percent of their holdings parked on the sidelines. Investors are holding higher-than-normal levels of cash, said MarkHaefele, global chief investment officer for UBS Wealth Management in London, who oversees around $2 trillion in assets. Thats one way of hedging the uncertainty. Nonetheless, Haefele said: Weve not seen significant de-risking around the election, but we have seen generally a consistent level of caution in the global client base. With uncertainty about the outcome on the rise, a risk-off mood has enveloped markets around the world.  The S&P 500 index has declined for eight days in a row, its longest losing streak since the market crash in October 2008, while a benchmark for global stocks, the MSCI All-World Index, has dropped for seven of the last eight sessions. Both sit near four-month lows.  Safe-haven bonds, recently under pressure from expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve is on track to raise interest rates this year, have seen only a modest boost in the meantime, but gold has surged to a one-month high near $1,300 an ounce. The trades youre seeing in the market at the moment will go further in the event of a Trump victory, said Mike Bell, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management in London. Youd expect more downside to U.S. equities, the dollar and Treasury yields. More than half of the stock and bond fund managers polled by Northern Trust in the third quarter said they expected the election to cause a large increase in market volatility. Prices for certain S&P 500 index options expiring in the days after the election indicate a market swing of between 2 and 4 percent, in either direction, by then. Still, portfolio managers sitting on a lot of cash, some with more than 20 percent of assets, say the stockpile is not a sign of worry about the outcome of the race.  Its due to the diminished risk-reward profile of investment opportunities in a mature profit cycle, said Meggan Walsh, a portfolio manager at the $18 billion Invesco Diversified Dividend Fund. We do not feel the election is an investable event. Some value-oriented large-cap fund managers say the stock market is over-valued and they are on high alert for a market correction as the election coincides with a bull market nearing completion of its eighth year.  It can be tempting to forget that nasty downturns happen with some regularity, and there is never a bell rung to announce their arrival, portfolio managers Arik Ahitov and Dennis Bryant recently warned investors in the $800 million FPA Capital Fund.  After Britain surprised the world with a vote to leave the European Union, the S&P 500 Index tumbled nearly 4 percent on June 24. It soon recovered, however, and had regained record territory by mid-August. Even in Britain, the referendums unexpected outcome has yet to show it has long-lasting effects for investors outside of the currency market, where the British pound has sunk to a three-decade low against the dollar. Londons FTSE 100 index is up around 14-percent from its post-Brexit trough. The FPA Capital Fund managers had nearly 28 percent of the funds $800 million in assets in cash during the third quarter. They see the stock market as too expensive and are ready for a high level of panic, if that happens, according to their October letter to investors. An elevated level of forced selling, combined with a lack of liquidity, might result in challenges for many fully invested products such as index funds, many ETFs, and funds that have no to very low levels of cash cushions, the FPA Capital Fund portfolio managers said.  In a down market, cash helps mitigate losses and affords one the opportunity to buy when others are being forced to sell, generally the best time to buy.    ",politicsNews,"November 4, 2016 ",1
Trump gains ground on Clinton: Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation," NEW YORK (Reuters) - The race for the Oval Office tightened significantly in the past week, as several swing states that Republican Donald Trump must win shifted from favoring Democrat Hillary Clinton to toss-ups, according to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project.  The two presidential candidates are now tied in Florida and North Carolina, and Clintons lead in Michigan has narrowed so much that the state is too close to call. Ohio remains a dead heat and Pennsylvania is now tilting to Clinton.  While Clinton remains the odds-on favorite to win Tuesdays election, Trump now has a plausible route to victory, especially if there is a sharp fall in turnout among African-Americans from the levels of the 2012 election.  Still, Trump must win both Florida and North Carolina to have a good chance of winning the White House. Clinton could lose both states and still win.  The States of the Nation project estimates Clintons odds of winning the needed 270 Electoral College votes at about 90 percent, down from 95 percent last week. If the election had been held on Wednesday, the project estimates, she would have had 256 solid electoral votes and an estimated final tally of about 302 votes, to 236 for Trump. Last week, she had 278 solid votes and a final tally of 320 votes, to 218 for Trump.  By any measure, however, Trump has had a good run in the past week. He has seen his support grow in 24 states while losing ground in 11. Conversely, Clintons support grew in 13 states while shrinking in 22.  Trumps gains came in a period in which he had few new controversies to fend off, while Clinton faced renewed scrutiny of her email practices.  Most respondents to the latest survey were asked about their support for the candidates after FBI Director James Comey announced last Friday the agency was examining newly discovered emails that might pertain to Clintons use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.  Comey had concluded in July at the end of a year-long FBI probe of the email issue that there were no grounds to bring any charges against Clinton. His brief letter to Congress last week said the new trove of emails might or might not be significant.  Trump and other Republicans seized on the news to question Clintons credibility, while Democrats complained it could unfairly influence voters so close to the election.  The States of the Nation project is a survey of about 15,000 people every week in all 50 states plus Washington, D.C. State by state results are available by visiting here It is unclear if the FBI inquiry upset the balance in the race. But many national polls have found the race tightening in recent days. Polling averages last week showed Clinton with a lead of between 4 and 7 points. Those averages now show her lead at just 2 to 3 points. Last week, the project had her leading 47 percent to 40 percent. This week, it dropped to 45 percent to 42 percent.  In the Reuters/Ipsos daily tracking poll from Oct. 28 to Nov. 1, Clinton led Trump by 6 percentage points among likely voters, the same margin as before the FBI announcement.  There are other reasons for the Clinton campaign to worry. Among voters who have cast early ballots, she leads Trump by about 8 points. At the same point in the 2012 race, President Barack Obama had a lead of 11 points among early voters over Republican rival Mitt Romney. Obamas gapnarrowed, however, to 6 points just before Election Day, according to the States of the Nation project and separate Reuters/Ipsos polling.  In Florida, where the candidates are tied at 47 percent, Clinton leads by 8 points among early voters. In 2012, Obama led by about 15 points.  In Ohio, where the race also is tied, she leads by about 20 points among early voters. At this point in 2012, Obama led by about 30 points.  It is not clear why Clintons early voting support has fallen short of Obamas. The shift could indicate a broader cross-section of voters is casting early ballots than in 2012. But the drop might also foreshadow lower-than-expected turnout among the core Democratic constituencies who propelled Obama to victory in 2008 and 2012.  Clintons success is built on holding together those blocs of voters. She does not, for example, enjoy the same support among African-Americans as Obama, the first black U.S. president. Diminished support among blacks, coupled with a large drop in black turnout, would hurt the Democrat.  If black Democratic turnout drops by 15 points nationally, for example, Clintons odds of winning drop to about 72 percent, by a projected margin of just 32 Electoral College votes. A drop of 20 points would reduce the odds of a Clinton victory to little more than a coin toss, according to the project.  Even a 10-point drop in black Democratic turnout coupled with a 5-point increase among white Republicans would flip the race to Trump, the project found.  The good news for Clinton is that about 60 percent of likely Hispanic voters are supporting her, similar to the numbers Obama enjoyed in 2012. A 10-point increase in Hispanic turnout would go a long way toward offsetting a 10-point decrease in black turnout, according to the project.  The outlook is not all gloom for Clinton. She has made the race close in Arizona, a longtime Republican stronghold. She has also regained the lead in Pennsylvania and is leading in Nevada.  ",politicsNews,"November 4, 2016 ",1
Death of Australian Hughes ruled 'tragic accident',"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The death of Australian batsman Phillip Hughes was a tragic accident and not as a result of a failure to enforce the rules of the game or inadequate safety equipment, the New South Wales (NSW) Coroners Court ruled on Friday. Hughes was hit on the back of the neck by a rising delivery when playing for South Australia in a domestic match at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Nov. 25, 2014. He died two days later in a Sydney hospital. After reviewing the circumstances surrounding the incident to determine whether the 25-year-olds death could have been avoided, NSW State Coroner Michael Barnes said he could find no evidence to support the view of Hughes family that he had died in a very unsafe workplace. The familys grief at losing their much loved son and brother was exacerbated by their belief that unfair play had contributed to his death, said Barnes. It is hoped that they accept the compelling evidence that the rules were complied with. Phillip was excelling at the crease as he so often did and that his death was a tragic accident. The helmet worn by Hughes came under the spotlight following his death, though the NSW Coroner said the batsmans death could not have been avoided by wearing different protective equipment.  Australias cricket board in May made it compulsory for players to wear helmets when facing fast and medium-paced bowling in line with recommendations from a review into the death of Hughes. The family had been angered that Hughes had been subjected to threatening language from an opponent and had suffered a sustained spell of aggressive short-pitched bowling that contravened the rules of the game.     Barnes accepted Hughes had received a barrage of short-pitch blowing, but all of which fell within the rules of the game. The court said it was unable to rule on whether Hughes had been subjected to threatening language, though Barnes said it was implausible that no sledging had occurred at all during the day. Hopefully, the focus on this unsavoury aspect of the incident may cause those who claim to love the game to reflect upon whether the practice of sledging is worthy of its participants, said Barnes.  An outsider is left to wonder why such a beautiful game would need such an ugly underside. ",politicsNews,"November 4, 2016 ",1
U.S. House Speaker Ryan running for re-election: spokeswoman,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan is running again for the job in the next Congress, a spokeswoman said on Thursday after a media report quoted several unidentified House Republicans as saying they expected him to step down next week. He is running, Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said. The Hill cited four House Republicans as saying that they expected Ryan to step aside as Speaker after next Tuesdays general election. Speculation is growing that Paul will not return, the Hill quoted a senior GOP lawmaker close to leadership as saying. It quoted a member of the Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative Republicans, as saying that if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton wins, Ryan will get a good share of the blame among House members who support Republican candidate Donald Trump. Ryan last month told fellow Republicans that he would not defend or campaign for Trump and would instead focus on re-electing Republicans to keep the majority in the House. This angered some Trump supporters in the House, who felt the Wisconsin congressman should stand by Trump. One of them, Representative Jim Bridenstine of Oklahoma, tweeted: if Paul Ryan isnt for Trump, then Im not for Paul Ryan. But Ryan, who as Speaker is the countrys highest-ranking Republican, has a great deal of support in the Republican caucus, and it is far from clear that his critics would be able to oust him if they tried. House Republicans, who currently number 246, plan to have closed-door leadership elections in mid-November. Ryan is expected to win their nomination for Speaker at that gathering, but the actual election to the Speakers post would not be held until the new Congress convenes in January. All members of the House, both Republican and Democrat, will vote in the Speaker election and Ryan will need 218 votes - a majority of the Houses 435 members - to win. This could be a challenge if Republicans lose a substantial number of seats in next weeks elections, and if some of those who remain decide to oppose Ryan. ",politicsNews,"November 3, 2016 ",1
U.S. court deals Trump a setback in poll-monitor fight,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a blow to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, a U.S. judge on Thursday upheld a Pennsylvania state law that could make it difficult for his supporters to monitor Election Day activity in Democratic-leaning areas. Trump has repeatedly said Tuesdays presidential election may be rigged, without providing scant evidence, and has urged supporters to keep an eye out for signs of voting fraud in Philadelphia and other heavily Democratic areas.  Democrats worry that could encourage Trump supporters to harass minority voters in a state that could determine whether Trump or his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, wins the presidency. Voting-rights advocates said they are already receiving reports of harassment. Democrats have launched a legal blitz of their own in an attempt to shut down Trumps poll-watching efforts in Pennsylvania and three other battleground states, arguing in lawsuits that Republican monitoring efforts amount to vigilante voter intimidation that violates federal law. They filed a fourth lawsuit in North Carolina on Thursday. Democrats are also trying to stop the Republican National Committee from supporting the poll-watching efforts of the Trump campaign or state parties.  Those cases have not yet been resolved. The RNC has said in legal motions that it is not involved in poll watching, which would violate a long-standing court order. State parties have argued that they are engaged in legitimate efforts to make sure the election is conducted accurately, while Trumps vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, and his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said they misspoke when they told media outlets that the campaign was working with the RNC on poll-watching efforts. In Pennsylvania, Trumps poll-monitoring plan faces a significant hurdle because state law requires partisan poll watchers to perform their duties in the county in which they are registered to vote.  That could make it difficult to recruit monitors in places like Philadelphia, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a ratio of eight to one. The city has 120,000 registered Republicans and 1,685 voting locations. The Pennsylvania Republican Party sought to suspend that requirement so that poll monitors could come from anywhere in the state, which would enable them to bring in supporters from suburban and rural areas where Trump has stronger support. But U.S. District Judge Gerald Pappert said that would be too disruptive to change the law less than a week before Tuesdays vote.  The Republican Party of Pennsylvania did not respond to a request for comment. Republican training materials submitted as evidence in several cases show the party is instructing poll monitors not to interact directly with voters, but to contact officials if they see a problem. That appeared to be the message in southern Ohio as well, where Trump supporter Becky Covey said the observers she had recruited were told not to interfere with voting activity. People think theyre going to be a watchdog, but thats not their job, Covey said. Those guidelines could have little influence on Trump supporters who decide to engage in anti-fraud efforts of their own on Election Day. The Oath Keepers, a paramilitary group, plans an undercover effort to monitor voting locations, while Trump ally Roger Stone is mobilizing supporters to conduct an exit poll to double-check election results. One right-wing group told the news website Politico that it has already installed hidden cameras in Philadelphia polling stations.  With early voting underway, civil rights advocates said they were already receiving reports of intimidation and harassment.  Palm Beach County, Florida, plans to station law enforcement officers at an early-voting site through Election Day after fielding complaints about bullhorn-wielding Trump supporters getting too close, according to ProPublica. Democrats in Nevada alleged that Trump supporters have yelled at voters and tried to block them from entering early-voting sites, while civil-rights groups in North Carolina and Texas said they have received reports of intimidating behavior at early voting sites. We are seeing an uptick in the number of complaints compared to 2012, said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a watchdog group.

White House study: China trade deal worsens damage from TPP failure,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration issued a fresh warning on Thursday about the dangers of Congress failing to pass its Asian trade deal, saying that millions of U.S. jobs could be at risk if a rival China-led trade pact is enacted. As they gear up for one last push to persuade Congress to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)in the two months following Tuesdays elections, senior administration officials said 35 U.S. industrial sectors would lose substantial ground to Chinese competitors in the Japanese market alone. In a new study, the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimated that Chinas Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RECAP) trade deal would likely lower Japanese tariffs on Chinese goods by five to 10 percentage points. If TPP is shelved, U.S. companies would be stuck with Japanese tariffs averaging twice as high as their Chinese competitors. Obama administration officials have long argued that China would seize economic leadership in Asia and write lower-standard trading rules for the region if TPP fails. The White House study seeks to quantify the argument by examining the effect of likely RCEP tariff cuts by Japan.  China is negotiating RCEP with 16 Asian countries, seven of which are also signatories to the TPP agreement: Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. If TPP is not passed and RCEP is enacted, which is what all these countries say they are planning to do, then U.S. businesses would face a direct loss of competitive position, said Jason Furman, the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.  This would displace U.S. goods and be worse than simply maintaining the trade status quo, Furman said. The study identifies 35 industrial sectors employing 4.7 million people with $5.3 billion in sales to Japan that would face such a disadvantage. A broad manufacturing sector stretching from sporting goods to office supplies could see $720 million in annual sales to Japan at risk, the study said.  The administration faces an uphill battle to get a vote for TPP in Congress post-election lame duck session, due to strong anti-trade rhetoric in the presidential campaign and House Speaker Paul Ryans recent comments that the trade deal lacks the votes for passage. But U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said he is continuing to press the TPP case with individual members and working with Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch to ease his concerns about patent protections for biologic drugs. Froman said these efforts have been met with a lot of receptivity. ",politicsNews,"November 3, 2016 ",1
FBI fear of leaks drove decision on emails linked to Clinton: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI Director James Comey was driven in part by a fear of leaks from within his agency when he decided to tell Congress the FBI was investigating newly discovered emails related to Hillary Clinton, law enforcement sources said on Thursday. The examination of the email traffic is now being carried out under the tightest secrecy by a team at Federal Bureau of Investigations headquarters in Washington, the sources said, requesting anonymity because of the inquirys sensitivity. Several sources said it was unclear whether the FBI would make any further public disclosures about its latest review before Tuesdays presidential and congressional elections. Two sources said such disclosures were unlikely. Another source, recently in contact with top investigators,  said: It depends on how it goes and what they find. The source said that, as of Thursday, nobody really knows whether the FBI will have anything further to say before the election.  Dropping like a bombshell on the U.S. presidential campaign, Comeys disclosure last Friday in a letter to senior lawmakers just days before the elections raised questions about his motives and drew criticism from some over his timing. Comey disclosed that the FBI was looking at emails as part of a probe into Clintons use of a private email system while secretary of state, without describing the emails content or how long the inquiry might take. The FBI normally does not comment on ongoing inquiries.  The latest emails examination was moving forward expeditiously, said one source close to the review. The new emails turned up as FBI investigators were examining  electronic devices used by former Democratic Representative Anthony Weiner in connection with an alleged sexting scandal. Weiners estranged wife, Huma Abedin, is a Clinton confidante. Two law enforcement sources familiar with the FBIs New York Field Office, which initially discovered the emails, said a faction of investigators based in the office is known to be hostile to Hillary Clinton. A spokeswoman for the FBIs New York office said she had no knowledge about this.  Democratic Party sources said such a faction was likely responsible for a recent surge in media leaks on alleged details of an ongoing FBI investigation of the Clinton Foundation.  The FBI has made preliminary inquiries into Clinton Foundation activities and alleged contacts between Trump and associates with parties in Russia, according to law enforcement sources. But these inquiries were shifted into low gear weeks ago because the FBI wanted to avoid any impact on the election. The FBI previously had spent about a year investigating Clintons use of the unauthorized server at her home in Chappaqua, New York, instead of the State Department system after classified government secrets were found in some of her emails. Comey had said in July that while there was evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.

Factbox: Wall Street's take on possible outcome of U.S. elections,"(Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump are in a tight race ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Following is a roundup of Wall Streets take on the likely outcome of the U.S. elections.  Analysts still expect a Clinton win, but with a lower probability after the FBI revealed it is examining newly found emails related to Clinton's use of a private server while she was secretary of state.(reut.rs/2eVjseK) Prior to this revelation, analysts were largely focused on the likelihood  albeit a small one  of a Democratic sweep of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives this election, and the implications of such a scenario on financial markets. (reut.rs/2fcIZ2O) MORE COVERAGE: bit.ly/2dOgcoE Tina Fordham, Chief Global Political Analyst, Citigroup Our probability of a 75 pct probability of a Clinton victory remains unchanged due to our longstanding caution over the risks of Black Swans, but these developments (FBIs latest announcement on Clinton email probe) have added a significant obstacle to the Clinton campaign, and are likely to further dent voter confidence.  The FBI announcement could increase the risk that if Trump loses he does not accept the result, as he has threatened. If a Clinton victory transpires and she presides over a Republican-controlled or divided Congress, the risk of continuous investigations and future impeachment risk is non-negligible. Shawn Golhar, Head of Public Policy Research, Barclays Capital While the FBI Directors letter may drive reluctant GOP voters to the polls and convince some remaining undecided voters to support Donald Trump, it is unclear if this will sway the election enough for Trump, given the Democratic electoral firewall, early voting indications, and Trumps lack of a voter turnout campaign. The 2016 elections continue to have two tail end risks: Donald Trump wins, or the Democrats sweep the White House and both chambers of Congress. Fridays announcement will likely increase Trumps chances of winning and whittle down the already slim chances of a Democratic sweep. Alec Phillips, U.S. Political Economist, Goldman Sachs The probability implied by online prediction markets that Sec. Clinton wins the White House has declined over the last several days, from between 80 pct and 90 pct in most markets over the last couple of weeks, to between 64 pct and 75 pct as of November 1... That said, Secretary Clinton is still seen by prediction markets to be twice as likely to win the election as Mr. Trump.         Polls have tightened in the U.S. presidential election... However, even after adjusting Sec. Clintons lead in state polls for her diminished margin nationally, she still appears likely to win more than the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the White House. As a starting point, note that the reliably Democratic states that Sec. Clinton currently leads by at least mid-single digits are worth 263 electoral votes. To reach 270, she must add to this North Carolina (15 EVs, Clinton leads by around 2pp), Colorado (9 EVs, Clinton leads by 1-2pp); and/or Nevada and the 2nd Congressional District of Maine (6 EVs plus 1 EV, Clinton leads by around 1pp in both).  By contrast, Mr. Trump has a solid lead in states worth 186 EVs; to reach 270 he would need to add to this Arizona (11 EVs, Trump leads by around 1pp), Florida (29 EVs, Trump leads by around 1pp), Ohio (18 EVs, Trump leads by around 2pp), plus Colorado, Nevada, and North Carolina, or some other combination that scores electoral votes even deeper into Democratic territory. This is still a significant polling deficit for Mr. Trump to overcome in a large number of states, particularly in contrast to Sec. Clinton, who simply needs to win one of the very competitive states she currently leads (Colorado, Nevada, or North Carolina) and maintain her sizable lead in the others to win. Stephen Gallagher, Americas Head of Research, Societe Generale Our baseline outcome is for Secretary Clinton to win the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Donald Trumps chances are modest but still viable. The latest FBI interest in emails demonstrates that, It isnt over till its over.     Traditionally, the losing candidate in a race concedes on the basis of incoming results, and that call is typically an early morning exercise. The challenge for 2016 is Trumps promise to maintain the suspense. Without a concession, markets and general public may presume the outcome on the basis of results, but difficult to confirm until states certify the results.  Thomas Block, Washington Policy Strategist, Fundstrat Global Advisors Fundamentals continue to point to a Clinton victory with 75 percent chances of a Clinton/Kaine win, but margins are likely to be closer in key swing states. However, Trump surprised and outperformed in primaries, and with recent events impossible to capture in polling, nothing is certain. ",politicsNews,"November 3, 2016 ",1
"Kerry says confident on Philippines ties, hopes to visit again","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Thursday he remained confident about the future of the U.S.-Philippines relationship despite a difference here or there and that he hoped to visit Manila again before leaving office. New Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has thrown Manilas long-standing alliance with Washington into question since taking office in June with a series of insults and threats to cut ties with the former colonial power. Speaking at a swearing-in ceremony for the new U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, Sung Kim, Kerry called the alliance between the two peoples indelible. Kerry recalled shared resistance to Japan in World War Two and noted that nearly 4 million people of Philippine descent live in the United States while almost a quarter of a million Americans live in the Philippines. I am confident about the future of our bilateral relations, notwithstanding a difference here or there about one thing or another, he said. Kerry did not mention Duterte by name but said all needed to have the wisdom to adjust to change brought about by democratic elections. He noted that Sung Kim had tackled some really tough, complex challenges in the past, given his previous assignments dealing with North Korea. Kerry said the United States and the Philippines would continue to consult openly and honestly and added: I very much hope to visit there before leaving my term of office as secretary of state. Kerrys term officially ends on Jan. 20 after Tuesdays U.S. presidential election, although he could be asked to stay on temporarily under the future administration.  He said he told Duterte on a visit to the Philippines in July of Washingtons ironclad commitment to the sovereignty and independence and security of the Philippines. We will continue to cooperate in efforts to maintain peace and stability and to promote shared prosperity in the Asia Pacific, Kerry said, adding that Washington would continue to help the Philippines in the event of national emergencies. Daniel Russel, the senior U.S. diplomat for East Asia, who visited the Philippines last month, conceded that the relationship was going through a bit of a rough patch - some growing pains. There been some name-calling coming out of Manila; some questions raised about what the future holds, he told a news briefing. But ... the deep, deep roots between the United States and the Philippines ... will over the long term ensure stability in the relationship. Russel, an assistant secretary of state, said all the senior officials he met in Manila told him they saw value in continued defense cooperation and he was not aware of any action that had significantly affected our ability to cooperate. I am not saying that cant happen, but I hope it doesnt, he said. In his latest outburst, Duterte chided the United States on Wednesday for the halt of a planned sale of 26,000 rifles to his country, calling those behind the decision fools and monkeys and indicating he might turn to Russia and China instead.

Trump wants ex-Goldman partner Mnuchin to run U.S. Treasury: Fox Business,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump wants his campaign finance chairman, Steven Mnuchin, to be his Treasury secretary if he wins next weeks U.S. presidential election, Fox Business Network reported on Thursday, citing sources. Mnuchin, a former partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc who also founded and runs the hedge fund company Dune Capital Management LP, joined Trumps campaign in May as his chief fundraiser. Fox Business Network, citing unnamed sources from inside the Trump campaign, said the New York businessman has told his team he wants Mnuchin to lead the U.S. Treasury Department if he wins the Nov. 8 election.  Representatives for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump largely funded his own campaign during the primary contest for Republican presidential nomination but moved to join with the Republican National Committee to jointly fundraise his general election campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton. He has still contributed millions of his own funds.   Trump has faced a significant fundraising deficit compared with his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Trump raised a total of $255 million, including about $56 million of his own money, compared to Clintons $513 million for the entire election cycle through Oct. 19. Last week, Trump pledge to donate an additional $10 million of his own personal funds. Mnuchin previously spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs and has helped finance numerous Hollywood movies, according to Bloomberg. He also previously worked for Soros Fund Management LLC, a hedge fund firm led by George Soros, a Clinton backer. Over the years, Mnuchin has donated thousands to Republicans as well as Democrats, according to federal campaign finance records, including to Clintons 2008 presidential campaign and her earlier Senate races.   Mnuchin, a graduate of Yale University who serves on several boards, resigned last year from the board of CIT Group Inc. ",politicsNews,"November 3, 2016 ",1
"Obama on FBI: 'We don't operate on innuendo,' leaks","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama defended Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Wednesday and criticized the FBI  announcement of new emails linked to her private server, saying there was no room for innuendo in the investigative process. In his first comment since the FBI reported a new cache of emails possibly related to Clinton, Obama said in a radio interview he did not want to meddle in the process.  But his displeasure at how it unfolded was clear. I do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations we dont operate on innuendo and we dont operate on incomplete information and we dont operate on leaks. We operate based on concrete decisions that are made, he told NowThisNews in the interview, which was taped on Tuesday and aired on Wednesday. The FBI said on Friday it had found new emails that might pertain to Clintons use of a private server for government business while she was Obamas first secretary of state from 2009-13. FBI Director James Comey said he did not know whether the emails were significant and released no information other than that they existed. His announcement 11 days before the Nov. 8 election drew outrage from Democrats and others who believed it would unfairly influence the vote. The decision flouted longstanding FBI traditions of keeping investigations confidential and avoiding politically sensitive announcements close to a presidential election.  On Monday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he would neither defend nor criticize Comeys decision. However, he added that the president expected an adherence to longstanding tradition and practice and norms that limit public discussion of information gathered in such investigations. Little is known yet about the emails, which were found during an unrelated probe into former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Obama noted that the FBI already has determined that Clinton had not intentionally transmitted classified information over her private email server but had been extremely careless.When this was investigated thoroughly the last time, the conclusion of the FBI the conclusion of the Justice Department, the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations was that she had made some mistakes but that there wasnt anything there that was prosecutable, Obama said. Obama defended Clinton, whose increasingly confident campaign was blindsided by the FBI announcement, as someone who has always put the American people first. When she makes a mistake, an honest mistake, it ends up being blown up as if its some crazy thing, he said. I trust her, I know her. And I wouldnt be supporting her if I didnt have absolute confidence in her integrity and her interest in making sure that young people have a better future. ",politicsNews,"November 2, 2016 ",1
California judge says too late to change voting selfie law,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A federal judge in California has ruled that it is too close to the Nov. 8 election to change a longstanding law in the state that bans the taking of photos of marked ballots, the latest court ruling pertaining to voting selfies.  U.S. District Court Judge William Alsupsaid on Wednesday lifting the ban at the last minute would create confusion and be unfair to the people running polling stations and the secretary of state. The law was designed to prevent voter intimidation, but many believe it is outdated in the age of social media.  Also on Wednesday, a federal court judge in Colorado heard arguments in a case challenging a 19th century law there that criminalizes the showing of a completed ballot to others, which Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey said included posts on social media.  A litigant in the case told Reuters that the judge is expected to rule by Friday.  And late last month, a federal court sided with a Michigan man who said a law that bans voters from taking pictures of their marked ballots and sharing them on social media was an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment right to free speech. The controversy over ballot selfies rose to national prominence after pop singer Justin Timberlake posted a photo he took of himself voting in his hometown of Memphis to his 37 million followers on Instagram. Authorities in Tennessee, which is one of 18 states with restrictions on photos in voting booths or of marked ballots, initially said they were investigating the singer before saying they did not think it was a good use of their resources.  A survey by AT&T released this week found that 20 percent of registered voters plan to take a selfies after they have voted.  It also found that 72 percent of respondents who are registered to vote do not share their opinions about the 2016 presidential election on social media.  The most inclined to share on social media are those less than 34 years old, according to the survey, which polled 3,608 U.S. mobile phone users.  Voters will chose a U.S. president on Tuesday, as well as U.S. senators, representatives and state and local officials. ",politicsNews,"November 3, 2016 ",1
"Mexico's border trade capital craves Clinton win, with caveats","NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico (Reuters) - Glafiro Montemayors scrubland near the U.S. border may not look like much but within a few years he hopes to transform it by building a giant new bridge across the Rio Grande, setting his sights on billions of dollars in U.S.-Mexico trade. Hailing from a long line of Mexican customs brokers, Montemayor bristles at U.S. Republican candidate Donald Trumps promise to build a wall between the two countries and his threat to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a treaty that has been good to Nuevo Laredo. Montemayor believes Nuevo Laredos border bridges are near capacity and he wants to build another on his wiry, mesquite-filled land that could eventually develop into a bi-national free trade zone, luring investment and jobs. He (Trump) wants to build walls, and the bilateral relationship requires that we build bridges, Montemayor said in his air-conditioned office, surrounded by hunting trophies. Like Montemayor, many in trade-dependent Nuevo Laredo fear Trumps proposed policies could threaten the citys economic future and they hope Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton wins the Nov. 8 election. Nonetheless, some fear Clinton, who was first lady when her husband Bill signed NAFTA in 1993, may have absorbed some of the anti-trade views espoused by Trump and her Democratic primary campaign rival Bernie Sanders during a bruising campaign.  In particular, they fret about her public backtracking over the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is seen as a key driver of future growth for the city.      Trump calls NAFTA the worst trade deal ever signed by the United States, claiming Mexico got all the benefits and it led to U.S. firms shipping jobs south. He has vowed to renegotiate the treaty, or possibly even scrap it.  Over $1.5 billion in trade crosses the U.S.-Mexico border each day and few places rely as heavily on that commerce as Nuevo Laredo, a feisty northeastern Mexican border city full of factory workers and truckers, but also drug traffickers.  Every day, a 6-km (3.7-mile) line of trucks backs up into Mexico, waiting to haul everything from tomatoes to fridge freezers across the World Trade Bridge into Texas. Car parts, agricultural products and plastics go the other way.  At least 40 percent of bilateral commerce flows across that bridge and nearly 20 percent of Mexicos value-added tax, or about $5 billion, is collected from the 12,500 trucks that cross the frontier each day, the World Trade Bridge authority says.  The bridge, it adds, is now the second most lucrative U.S. port after the Port of Long Beach in Los Angeles. On a visit to the bridge itself, it is easy to understand why Mexican drug cartels have fought vicious battles to control the Nuevo Laredo crossing, turning the city into a hotbed of teenage gunslingers and nervy soldiers.  Of the 6,500-odd trucks that enter the United States each day, officials can only search 1,000 at most. Drugs move north into the United States and guns and cash easily flow south. Bootlegging has long been a way of life here. The former Zetas cartel kingpin Miguel Trevino, aka Z-40, was born in Nuevo Laredo, and Edgar Valdez, or La Barbie, a one-time associate of jailed capo Joaquin El Chapo Guzman, is a native of Laredo, just across the river in Texas.   Those involved in legitimate cross-border trade clam up when talk turns to drug smuggling, a scourge that Trump has used to bash Mexico, and prefer to talk about lawful commerce. Since the September 11 attacks in 2001, when the United States tightened its borders, Nuevo Laredos business community learned the hard way that security was the primary concern for its northern neighbor. Those days were terrible. The borders were almost closed, said Carlos Martinez, a customs broker, radio host and academic. But as a result of U.S. security concerns, he said trade practices improved, with the development of efficient programs like the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) scheme which allows  trusted importers to transit quickly across the border. Ever since, the trend along the border has been for greater integration and more streamlined borders, Martinez said. For example, as of 2015, the Cross Border Xpress bridge allows travelers to cross seamlessly between Tijuana airport and San Diego. That same year, the first new rail bridge between Mexico and the United States in over a century opened.  So, regardless of campaign politics, some here believe Clinton is more committed to free trade than she has shown publicly in this campaign and that even Trump will need to protect bilateral trade if he wins. Sean Doherty, a 35-year U.S. Customs and Border Protection veteran, was involved in the development of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), a supply chain program with over 11,000 companies enrolled that helps expedite secure cross-border commerce.  He said the program is one of many border schemes that both the U.S. government and thousands of businesses had invested heavily in to create and run.  I think (Trump) would have a lot of push-back or blowback if he tried to disband that type of a program, Doherty said.  A lot of his rhetoric is just that, rhetoric. And if he does happen to win, I think a lot of things that hes proposing - hell come back down to earth. Miguel Conchas, president of the Laredo Chamber of Commerce, is also dubious Trump could fulfill all his campaign promises. Nonetheless, he said the Trump effect is already being felt across the river in Texas. The real estate moguls ascent has helped push the peso currency to record lows, hurting Laredos retail and banking businesses which rely on Mexican customers.  Alfredo Espinoza, who runs the World Trade Bridge trust in Nuevo Laredo, is downcast about the election, and feels a more protectionist era is imminent.  We dont think Trump is going to win, he said, speaking in his office overlooking a seemingly endless line of trucks. Nonetheless, Hillary ... wont open the U.S. market, she will protect it. That scares us here in Mexico. ",politicsNews,"November 3, 2016 ",1

"Looking past vote, U.S. coal country sees millennials as key to revival","HUNTINGTON, WV (Reuters) - When Carissa Sellards talks to her West Virginia University friends about post-graduation plans, one dilemma keeps coming up  whether to stay in their home state or strike out for more promising opportunities elsewhere. If recent history holds, over half of them will either not find work or leave the state, contributing to a brain drain of young talent that is pushing the state to try to reinvent its economy and break with a coal industry in long-term decline.  Companies dont come here to invest because they only associate us with coal, said Sellards, a 20-year-old sophomore who addressed the state legislature when she was in high school about the lack of opportunities for young people in a post-coal economy. The often stark choices faced by Sellards and other young, educated West Virginians underline the challenges awaiting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton here and in other Rust Belt states if she wins the Nov. 8 election, as most polls suggest she will. West Virginia is expected to vote decisively for Republican Donald Trump, who has gained in recent polls and promises to revive the coal industry and put miners back to work by easing environmental restrictions and renegotiating trade deals to Americas advantage. It is a message that has resonated with millions of older voters in other Rust Belt states facing declines in manufacturing jobs and feeling threatened by foreign competition.  But it largely rings hollow for college-educated millennials like Sellards, who are seeking jobs in the service economy or technology sector. By contrast, Clinton alienated swathes of West Virginia voters by saying earlier this year that weregoing to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business in transitioning to cleaner energy. Coal industry backers have long accused President Barack Obama of waging a war on coal by imposing tougher environmental standards. Clinton later apologized for her comment, and has proposed a $30 billion plan to help revitalize coal communities. The plan promises to secure health benefits for former coal workers, invest in new infrastructure such as broadband access, and repurpose old mines and power plant sites. Clinton energy adviser Trevor Houser has said her challenge will be to help coal and other Rust Belt communities deal with economic realities rather than false promises of restoring dying industries. Beneath the nostalgic coal rhetoric, West Virginia officials and grassroots groups have quietly started to focus on reversing the flight of college-educated millennials to help drive an economic revival.  Of the 124,358 students who graduated from public higher education in West Virginia in the last decade, 58,730 were working in the state in 2014, a work participation rate of 47.2 percent, according to a report released by West Virginia Universitys Bureau of Business and Economic Research on Monday.  The state had the 11th biggest net outflow of college degree holders from 2007-2014, according to the most recent U.S. census.  One barrier to keeping graduates in state is a business start-up rate that is the lowest in the country at 5.1 percent in 2014, the most recent year of available data. A Reuters analysis of national data shows a strong connection between migration patterns of college graduates and local start-up rates: Among the 25 states with start-up rates below the 2014 median of 6.8 percent, 19 saw a net outflow of college grads between 2007 and 2014. The debate over West Virginias economic future comes as its coal production this year hit its lowest level since the 1970s.  West Virginias energy sector, which includes coal, natural gas production and utilities, account for 17 percent of the states GDP but only 4 percent of employment. Coal industry employment plunged 53 percent between the fourth quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2016, down from nearly 26,000 to just over 12,000.  The government is the states biggest employer, accounting for 20 percent of jobs, with healthcare a fast-growing sector at 17 percent. In 2014, West Virginias real GDP grew 0.7 percent from the previous year compared to the national average of 2.2 percent.  The state is one of a few whose population shrank over the past two years, according to the latest national census. By median age it is the second-oldest U.S. state, four years above the national average.     At the West Virginia University Institute of Technologys new campus in Beckley, which opened in August, close to some of the states coal counties, officials hope to turn the struggling city into an innovation hub. In addition to offering courses in burgeoning fields like computer science, sustainable tourism and health care, WVU Tech hosts the Launch Lab, a small business incubator thathelps budding entrepreneurs bring ideas to fruition. Joe Carlucci, a small business coach and director of the LaunchLab, said West Virginia is at the start of a long process of reinvention after decades of mourning coal. They are prepared to plant that seed and not see the shade of that tree, he said. They are seeing that we have to change our own story. Although Clinton would struggle to regain popularity in Rust Belt states if elected, these regions would have an incentive to work with her administration to tap into federal grants. West Virginia Republican Congressman Evan Jenkins, a member of the House appropriations committee who represents the states southern coal-producing regions, said the state cannot turn down assistance to diversify its economy. I want to continue fueling grant-making opportunities to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit and energy of the states millennials, he told Reuters at a ceremony in August in which federal grants were awarded. But unleashing that spirit will require a significant investment in infrastructure, specifically broadband access, something that local lawmakers ignored when coal was still performing well eight years ago, said Chris Walters, a 30-year old Republican state senator.  Walters is focused on getting legislation passed to expand broadband access throughout the mountainous state, which ranks near the bottom of the list of broadband connectivity, just ahead of Guam and Puerto Rico. If we dont give connectivity to our residents, we arent giving them the opportunity to succeed in the global economy, said Walters. In state capital Charleston, NGO Generation West Virginia has helped pass legislation to attract young entrepreneurs seeking low-cost alternatives to places like Denver or San Francisco, including a bill to waive business start-up fees to people under 30 and another to allow crowd-funding to help seed new businesses. Entrepreneurship also extends to industries like agriculture, which state officials see as an opportunity in the states rural coal counties. An entrepreneurship program called the Coalfield Development Corporation won a $2 million grant this year to help train young people from coal counties to run businesses, offering them college classes, life skills and paid apprenticeships. Ben Gilmer, the 34-year-old director of the corporations agriculture entrepreneurship program Refresh Appalachia, said part of Clintons challenge in coal country will be to sell the vision of a future that is unfamiliar. Small programs like his can offer concrete examples and help ease the transition, he said. Politicians take advantage of peoples fear of what comes next, Gilmer said. But five years from now, we will have examples and that will speak louder than any rhetoric thats out there.  ",politicsNews,"November 3, 2016 ",1
"In America's 'Rust Belt,' more voters trust Clinton on trade: Reuters/Ipsos poll","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps promise to restore American jobs by renegotiating international trade deals appears to be failing him in states most affected by outsourcing, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Voters in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania - three competitive states in the Nov. 8 election that form the bulk of a region dubbed the Rust Belt for its swaths of shuttered factories - favor Trumps Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, on the issue of trade, according to the polling, with some respondents citing how international trade can bring down prices. The results underscore the uphill battle the New York businessman faces on Election Day, when he needs to sweep a broad array of battleground states to win the White House. Trump has made a strong effort to portray Clinton as favorable to trade policies that he has labeled a disaster for the United States, said Thomas Nelson, a political science professor at Ohio State University.         In the automaking state of Michigan, which has voted reliably for Democratic candidates in recent presidential elections but which Trump has fought hard to win, some 40 percent of likely voters believed Clinton would be better equipped to address trade, compared with 36 percent for Trump. In Ohio, known for its aerospace, steel and rubber industries, 45 percent said Clinton would be better on trade, compared with 38 percent for Trump. In Pennsylvania, long a steel and heavy manufacturing center, 45 percent favored Clinton on trade, compared with 38 percent for Trump, according to the polling, conducted in mid-October. Clinton is leading Trump in all three states among likely voters, with advantages of 4 points in Michigan, 3 points in Ohio and 6 points in Pennsylvania, according to the Reuters/Ipsos polling.  But other polls show the race tightening in those states. RealClearPolitics, which averages data from most major polls, shows Clinton leading Trump by 6.6 points in Michigan and 5.1 points in Pennsylvania, and Trump leading Clinton by 2.7 points in Ohio. Officials for Trumps campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Poll respondents reached by Reuters who favored Clinton on trade mainly gave two reasons - first, that international trade deals can help people by lowering prices for goods; and second, they doubt Trump can deliver on his promise to restore the U.S. manufacturing sector. We all like to have inexpensive items, Ronald Lane, 56, of Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, who plans to vote for a third-party candidate next week as a protest against both Trump and Clinton. I think its important to save American jobs which have already gone overseas, but I dont believe there is much that can be done to bring them back, he said. Christina Ledesma, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, a Clinton supporter, said she also disagreed with Trump that the economy would suffer a lasting negative effect from trade deals. Our unemployment rate is lower than its been since 2008. What jobs are you bringing back? she said. Michigans unemployment rate was 4.6 percent in September, below the national average of 5 percent. Ohios was at 4.8 percent and Pennsylvanias at 5.7 percent. Trump has called the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico one of the worst deals ever struck and blames it for manufacturing jobs being moved to Mexico. He also opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would open markets in East Asia. Trump argues that the deal, which must be ratified by Congress, would motivate more U.S. companies to move their production overseas.  Last week while campaigning, he called outsourcing the greatest job theft in the history of the world.  The jobs theft will end  the day I start the presidency. Its going to be America first again, he said. Clinton has offered a more tempered approach, saying she would seek to re-evaluate NAFTA if elected and that there were problems with some aspects of the TPP. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English from Oct. 6 to Oct. 17 in Michigan and Pennsylvania, and from Oct. 6 to Oct. 12 in Ohio. It included 1,370 likely voters in Michigan, 1,467 in Pennsylvania, and 1,200 in Ohio. All three state polls had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.

"Trump, Clinton blast each other on character; Clinton rises in poll","PENSACOLA, Fla./ LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump attacked one anothers character as they pushed their closing arguments six days before the U.S. presidential election, while the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Clintons lead over Trump rising back to the margin she held last week. Many national polls have shown Clintons lead over Trump narrowing since the re-emergence Friday of a controversy over her use of a private email while secretary of state. But the latest Reuters/Ipsos daily tracking poll released on Wednesday showed Clintons lead over Trump rising back up to 6 percentage points, the same advantage she held before the FBI announcement related to her email practices.  Signs of a tightening race have rattled financial markets as investors started to factor in the possibility that the New York businessman might pull off a victory on Nov. 8. World stocks, the dollar and oil fell on Wednesday, while safe-haven assets such as gold and the Swiss franc rose. Clinton has been regarded as the candidate who would maintain the status quo, an important factor to financial markets, which generally do not like uncertainty. Campaigning in Pensacola, Florida, Trump predicted he would win, telling supporters at the outdoor rally, Its feeling like it already, isnt it? Weve got to be nice and cool, nice and cool. Alright, stay on point, Donald, stay on point. No sidetracks, Donald, nice and easy, said Trump, whose campaign has at times been damaged by controversial unscripted remarks. Trump argued that Clinton was unqualified to lead the country, calling her totally unhinged. Speaking to supporters in Las Vegas, Clinton blamed Trump for pitting Americans against one another, citing his rhetoric on groups like Muslims and Mexican-Americans. Trump, she said, is out of his depth, and she called his proposals on foreign policy issues incredibly dangerous. He doesnt have a clue, Clinton said.  Investor anxiety has deepened in recent days over a possible Trump victory given uncertainty about his stance on issues including foreign policy, trade relations and immigrants. Trump, who has never previously run for elected office, has run an unorthodox campaign, with policy proposals including reviewing trade pacts such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and imposing a temporary ban on Muslims seeking to enter the country. Currency traders have sold the dollar this week in part because they suspect Trump would prefer a weaker dollar given his protectionist stance on international trade, and in part because the uncertainty surrounding a Trump win might lead to a more dovish stance from the Federal Reserve in the months ahead, instead of the interest rate hike that many expect by year-end. A rise in U.S. interest rates would make the dollar, and dollar-denominated assets, more attractive to investors. A Reuters equity market poll last month showed a majority of forecasters predicted that U.S. stocks would perform better under a Clinton presidency than a Trump administration. An average of polls compiled by the RealClearPolitics website showed Clinton just 1.7 percent ahead of Trump nationally on Wednesday, with 47 percent support to his 45.3 percent. Clintons position is stronger than national polls imply given that the race is decided by the Electoral College system of tallying wins on a state-by-state basis. Winning the presidency requires a majority of 270 electoral votes, and Democrats have a built-in advantage with large states such as California and New York traditionally voting Democratic.  Clinton looked likely to win at least 226 electoral votes, meaning she would need to pick up votes in toss-up states such as Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, Ohio, Iowa, Arizona, Colorado and Nevada, according to estimates by RealClearPolitics on Wednesday afternoon. Trump, on the other hand, has a steeper path to climb, looking likely to win 180 electoral votes, meaning he needs more votes from the battleground states, the website showed. Both candidates are focusing their final campaign efforts on those crucial states. Trump and Clinton have campaigned intensively in recent weeks in Florida, which yields a rich haul of 29 electoral votes. A RealClearPolitics average of polls in the state puts Trump 0.7 point ahead of Clinton.  In North Carolina on Wednesday, Clinton deployed President Barack Obama to make the case that Trump posed a unique threat to the future of the country.  The fate of the republic rests on your shoulders, Obama told supporters in Chapel Hill, calling Trump temperamentally unfit to lead the nation. Trumps campaign announced plans to run three ads during Wednesday nights Game Seven of the World Series, held in Cleveland, Ohios second biggest city. The ads focus on the renewed controversy surrounding Clintons email server. In an ad titled Corruption, an announcer says: Hillary cut deals for donors. Now the FBI has launched a new investigation. After decades of lies and scandal, her corruption is closing in. ",politicsNews,"November 2, 2016 ",1
U.S. Commerce chief warns against China semiconductor investment binge,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Massive government investment in Chinas semiconductor industry risks distorting the global market for integrated circuits, leading to damaging overcapacity and stifling innovation, U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker has warned.      The comments come at a time of growing trade tension between the Asian giant and the United States over accusations of dumping, industrial overcapacity and a souring business climate for foreign firms doing business in China.  Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has threatened to levy punitive tariffs of 45 percent on imports of Chinese goods if he is elected. In a speech on Wednesday, Pritzker sharply criticized a $150-billion plan by the Chinese government to expand the share of Chinese-made integrated circuits in the domestic market to 70 percent by 2025, from 9 percent now. Let me state the obvious: this unprecedented state-driven interference would distort the market and undermine the innovation ecosystem, Pritzker said at the Center for Strategic Studies think-tank in Washington.  That level of investment would be equivalent to half of worldwide semiconductor sales last year and result in market distortions similar to those plaguing the steel, aluminum and green technology industries, Pritzker added.       The world has seen the effects of this type of targeted, government-led interference before, she said. The result has been overcapacity in the global marketplace that has artificially reduced prices, cost jobs in both the United States and around the world, and caused significant damage to those industries globally, Pritzker said.  It was imperative we take steps to prevent a similar situation from developing in the semiconductor industry, she added.  Such steps include a Commerce Department study of the global semiconductor supply chain now underway, besides engaging with China, and other governments, to persuade them to avoid policies that distort markets or spur technology transfers. The U.S. government will make clear to Chinas leaders at every opportunity that we will not accept a $150-billion industrial policy designed to appropriate this industry, Pritzker added. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that China advocates for all countries to provide a fair and transparent investment environment. We hope everyone can rationally view relevant trade and investment cooperation and work together to create a positive atmosphere, she told reporters at a regular briefing when asked about Pritzkers remarks. Chinas Ministry of Commerce did respond immediately to a request for comment.  Earlier on Thursday, 12 U.S. senators urged that Zhongweng Internationals $2.3-billion purchase of Cleveland, Ohio-based Aleris Corp. be rejected by a national security review panel. In addition, we are seeing new attempts by China to acquire companies and technology based on their governments interests  not commercial objectives. And we have witnessed attempts to restrict access to Chinas domestic market, Pritzker said. The technology industry depends on a global supply chain, open and fair trade and innovation, she said, warning against government behavior that disrupts the system and distorts markets. Chinas effort to move up the value chain should be the result of healthy competition and free and fair trade, not state-directed investments aimed at distorting global markets, Pritzker said. In addition, no government should require technology transfer, joint-venture, or localization as a quid pro quo for market access.  ",politicsNews,"November 3, 2016 ",1
Twelve U.S. senators urge security rejection of China aluminum M&A deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Twelve U.S. senators urged on Wednesday that a national security review panel reject Chinese aluminum giant Zhongwang International Group Ltds proposed $2.3 billion purchase of U.S. aluminum products maker Aleris Corp. The senators asked Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in a letter to launch a review of the deal by the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States and ultimately reject it on grounds that it would damage the U.S. defense industrial base.  Zhongwangs purchase of Aleris would directly undermine our national security, including by jeopardizing the U.S. manufacturing base for sensitive technologies in an industry already devastated by the effects of Chinas market distorting policies, and creating serious risk that sensitive technologies and knowhow will be transferred to China, further imperiling U.S. defense interests, the senators wrote. The deal, announced just over two months ago, would give one of the worlds largest makers of extruded aluminum products access to U.S. technology and customers, which include Boeing Co and U.S. and European automakers that are increasingly turning to aluminum. It comes as another Zhongwang subsidiary is embroiled in a dispute over U.S. import duties amid broader trade tensions between the U.S. aluminum industry and China. The U.S. Commerce Department is currently investigating China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd over allegations that it has been evading U.S. import duties on extruded products by shipping them through third countries. The letter to Lew was signed by Republican Rob Portman of Ohio, where Aleris is based, and Democrats Ron Wyden, Charles Schumer, Bob Casey, Joe Manchin, Kirsten Gillibrand, Joe Donnelly, Debbie Stabenow, Jeff Merkley, Amy Klobuchar,Tammy Baldwin and Al Franken. They said the review committee needed to be cautious about the potential for sensitive research data to be transferred to China, including data with military applications such as advanced modeling techniques, high-strength alloys and the design of light armor material. Despite the national security importance of our nations aluminum sector, the industry continues to be decimated by Chinas market distorting policies that contribute to vast overcapacity, the senators wrote. Chinas overcapacity in aluminum has directly contributed to severe reductions in U.S. domestic production as smelters unable to compete have been forced to close.Each such closure further imperils our nations ability to ensure a reliable supply of strategic materials in times of crisis, they wrote. A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment on the letter, adding that information filed with CFIUS by law cannot be disclosed to the public and that Treasury does not comment on specific CFIUS cases. Aleris said in a statement reacting to the letter that the companys U.S. facilities produce no defense-related products, and the technology for aluminum plate used in some defense products was widely used in the industry. Our facilities in the U.S. produce aluminum for car and truck exteriors, gutters and roofing material, Aleris said.  Less than one percent of our sales go into defense applications, and none of those goods are produced in the U.S. A Zhongwang spokeswoman said in a statement that the CFIUS filing for the transaction is voluntary and that the company and its U.S. subsidiary have no connection with the Chinese government. She added that the transaction will bring in additional resources and capital to Aleris and there will be no changes to management, employees or business strategies.

"Mississippi church burned, vandalized with 'Vote Trump'","JACKSON, Miss. (Reuters) - A historic black church in Mississippi was burned and spray-painted with Vote Trump and authorities said on Wednesday it was arson and being probed as a hate crime committed one week before the U.S. presidential election. Greenville Fire Chief Ruben Brown Sr. told a news conference on Wednesday afternoon that investigators had determined the fire at Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church was intentionally set. Samples and evidence have been collected from inside the church and are being analyzed to determine the accelerant or ignition source, Brown said. Earlier in the day he said no one was injured in the Tuesday evening blaze, but the church was extensively damaged.  Were investigating this as a hate crime, Greenville Police Chief Delando Wilson told a news conference early on Wednesday. We feel that the quote on the church is intimidating. It tries to push your beliefs on someone else, and this is a predominantly black church and no one has a right to try to influence the way someone votes in this election. Wilson told the Wall Street Journal that police on Wednesday evening were interviewing a person of interest in connection with the fire but the individual had not been charged. Wilson did not immediately return a call or email.  Black churches in the U.S. South have long been a base of support for the Democratic Party.  During the U.S. civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, southern black churches were often targets for arson and bombings by white supremacists. The FBI Jackson Division is aware of the situation in Greenville, and we are working with our local, state and federal law enforcement partners to determine if any civil rights crimes were committed, the agency said in a statement. This act is a direct assault of peoples right to freely worship, Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons said in a statement.  The town of some 33,000 people is about 100 miles (160 kms) northwest of Jackson. The act that happened left our hearts broken, Pastor Carolyn Hudson told the news conference, noting that the church has a 111-year history. The Mississippi Republican Party declined to comment.  In October, the Orange County Republican Partys office in Hillsborough, North Carolina, was set on fire and a graffiti message left nearby said leave town or else.

U.S. militia girds for trouble as presidential election nears," JACKSON, Ga. (Reuters) - Down a Georgia country road, camouflaged members of the Three Percent Security Force have mobilized for rifle practice, hand-to-hand combat training  and an impromptu campaign rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.  How many people are voting for Trump? Ooh-rah! asks Chris Hill, a paralegal who goes by the code name Bloodagent.  Ooh-rah! shout a dozen militia members in response, as morning sunlight sifted through the trees last weekend.  As the most divisive presidential election in recent memory nears its conclusion, some armed militia groups are preparing for the possibility of a stolen election on Nov. 8 and civil unrest in the days following a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton.  They say they wont fire the first shot, but theyre not planning to leave their guns at home, either.  Trump's populist campaign has energized militia members like Hill, who admire the Republican mogul's promise to deport illegal immigrants, stop Muslims from entering the country and build a wall along the Mexico border. Trump has repeatedly warned that the election may be ""rigged,"" and has said he may not respect the results if he does not win. At least one paramilitary group, the Oath Keepers, has called on members to monitor voting sites for signs of fraud.  Armed paramilitary groups first gained prominence in the early 1990s, fueled by confrontations in Ruby Ridge, Idaho and Waco, Texas, culminating in a militia sympathizers 1995 bombing of a federal office building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people.  Their numbers dwindled following that attack but have spiked in recent years, driven by fears that President Barack Obama will threaten gun ownership and erode the power of local government. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups, estimates there were 276 active militias last year, up from 42 in 2008.  In recent years, armed groups have confronted federal authorities in a series of land-use disputes in the western United States. Federal officials fear more clashes could come after seven militants were acquitted on conspiracy charges for occupying a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon.  Many fear Clinton would push the county further to the left.  This is the last chance to save America from ruin, Hill said. Im surprised I was able to survive or suffer through eight years of Obama without literally going insane, but Hillary is going to be more of the same.  The Oath Keepers, a prominent anti-government force that sent gun-toting members to the 2014 race riots in Ferguson, Missouri, called on members last week to monitor voting sites on election day for any signs of fraud.  An hour south of Atlanta, the Three Percent Security Force started the day around the campfire, taking turns shooting automatic pistols and rifles at a makeshift target range. They whooped with approval when blasts from one members high-powered rifle knocked down a tree.  The group operates independently, but is affiliated with a national armed movement that calls for members to defend individual rights in the face of what they see as an overreaching federal government. The movement draws its name from the notion that no more than 3 percent of the American population fought in the Revolutionary War against Britain.  Amid the war games, Hill weighed plans for a possible armed march on Washington if Clinton wins.  He said he doesnt want his members leading the way, but they will defend the protesters if need be. His group will not hesitate to act if a President Clinton tries to disarm gun owners, he said.  I will be there to render assistance to my fellow countrymen, and prevent them from being disarmed, and I will fight and I will kill and I may die in the process, said Hill, who founded the militia several years ago.  Trumps candidacy has emboldened extremist groups to speak more openly about challenging the rule of law, said Ryan Lenz, a researcher at the Southern Poverty Law Center.  Prior to this campaign season, these ideas were relegated to sort of the political fringe of the American political landscape, he said. Now these ideas are legitimized.  Over the past week, some prominent Trump supporters have hinted at violence.  If Trump loses, Im grabbing my musket, former Illinois Representative Joe Walsh wrote on Twitter last week. Conservative commentator Wayne Root fantasized about Clintons death while speaking at a Trump rally in Las Vegas on Sunday.  Back in Georgia, the Three Percent Security Force wrapped up rifle practice in the midday sun. They then headed further into the trees to tackle an obstacle course with loaded pistols at their sides, ready for whatever may come.  Weve building up for this, just like the Marines, he said. We are going to really train harder and try to increase our operational capabilities in the event that this is the day that we hoped would never come.  ",politicsNews,"November 2, 2016 ",1
Anthony Weiner checks into sex addiction rehab clinic: Daily Mail,"(Reuters) - Disgraced former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner has checked into a rehab facility that treats sex addiction, the DailyMail.com reported on Wednesday. The online version of the British newspaper said electronic devices are banned at the facility, which separates men from women and treats a range of addictions related to cyber sex, exhibitionism and anonymous sex and other acts. The facility was not named in the report. Reuters could not independently verify the report. Weiner could not be reached for comment. Federal prosecutors and New York police announced last month they were investigating Weiner following a separate report by the DailyMail.com that he engaged in sexually explicit cellphone and online messages with a 15-year-old girl from North Carolina. Weiner, 52, did not respond at the time to Reuters requests for comment on the texting report but told the Associated Press last month that he had likely been the subject of a hoax. An investigation into those messages also triggered a new FBI probe of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintons emails, as some of her emails were found on a device related to the Weiner investigation, sources close to the matter said. Once a popular congressman, Weiner resigned in 2011 after saying he had accidentally sent a lewd picture over Twitter. Two years later, his campaign for New York City mayor was derailed after explicit photos he had sent under the pseudonym Carlos Danger to a young woman in Indiana surfaced. Weiners wife, Huma Abedin, one of Clintons top aides, said in August she was separating from her husband after yet another scandal. Abedins announcement followed a New York Post report that Weiner had recently sent photos of his boxer-brief-clad genitals  one while he was in bed with their toddler son  via Twitter to another woman. An attorney for Abedin could not be reached on Wednesday to comment on the DailyMail.com report. ",politicsNews,"November 3, 2016 ",1
"Clinton leads Trump by 6 points, same as before FBI announcement: Reuters/Ipsos","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton led Republican Donald Trump by 6 percentage points among likely voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos daily tracking poll released on Wednesday, the same advantage the Democratic presidential nominee held before an FBI announcement that reignited the controversy about her email practices. The Oct. 28-Nov. 1 opinion poll was conducted almost entirely after FBI Director James Comey notified Congress last Friday his agency would examine newly discovered emails that might pertain to Clintons use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Comey said he did not know whether the emails were significant and released no information other than that they existed. His announcement drew outrage from Democrats who voiced concern it would unfairly influence voters so close to next weeks election. Trump and other Republicans seized on the news to revive questions about Clintons credibility. Among 1,772 people who have either voted already or were identified as likely voters in the Nov. 8 election, 45 percent said they supported Clinton, while 39 percent said they backed Trump. On Thursday, the day before Comeys announcement, Clinton led Trump by 43 percent to 37 percent. In a four-way poll that included alternative party candidates, Clinton led Trump by 8 percentage points among likely voters. Forty-five percent supported Clinton, while 37 percent backed Trump. Five percent supported Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and 2 percent backed Jill Stein of the Green Party. Other national polls have shown Clintons lead shrinking over the past week. RealClearPolitics, which averages most major opinion polls, showed Clintons lead had narrowed to 1.7 points on Wednesday from 4.6 points last Friday. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"November 2, 2016 ",1

Trump raised $100 million in 'small-dollar' donations in October,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump raised $100 million in October from small-dollar donors, his campaign announced on Wednesday. His campaign announced that the total was garnered from 1.6 million small-dollar donations, a term traditionally used to describe contributions of less than $250.  Trump has faced a significant fundraising deficit compared with his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. In the first 19 days of October, Trump raised about $30 million, compared with Clintons $53 million.  (This story corrects time element to Wednesday, instead of Tuesday, in first paragraph.)

Ku Klux Klan newspaper declares support for Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Ku Klux Klan newspaper has declared support for Donald Trumps Republican run for U.S. president, saying America became great because it was a white, Christian republic. The Crusader, one of the white supremacist groups most prominent publications, published a lengthy endorsement and defense of Trumps message on the front page of its current issue under the headline: Make America Great Again. Make America Great Again is Trumps campaign slogan. The Trump campaign rejected the groups support. In a statement, campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said, Mr. Trump and the campaign denounces hate in any form. This publication is repulsive and their views do not represent the tens of millions of Americans who are uniting behind our campaign. The KKK is the oldest white supremacist group in the United States, tracing its roots back to the Reconstruction period in the South that followed the Civil War. In addition to anti-black views, it has expressed anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant and anti-gay views and, until recently, was anti-Roman Catholic. Earlier this year, former KKK leader David Duke of Louisiana voiced support for Trump, saying white people are threatened in America and that he hears echoes of his views in Trumps rhetoric.  Trump drew criticism in February for failing to quickly disavow support from Duke. Some critics have condemned as racist Trumps call for limiting Muslim immigration, building a wall along the border with Mexico and criticism of a Mexican-American judge. In The Crusader, Pastor Thomas Robb wrote, While Trump wants to make America great again, we have to ask ourselves, What made America great in the first place? America was great not because of what our forefathers did -but because of who our forefathers were. America was founded as a White Christian Republic. And as a White Christian Republic it became great, Robb wrote. Robb, based in Arkansas, heads the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, which took over in the 1980s after the departure of Duke, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hates groups.

Trump's campaign should be fair game in Trump University trial: lawyers,"(Reuters) - Statements Donald Trump has made during his presidential run should generally be admissible in an upcoming civil trial over alleged fraud at his Trump University venture, lawyers for the plaintiffs said in a court filing late on Tuesday. Some of the statements by the Republican nominee may be helpful to jurors as they try to determine Trumps credibility, the lawyers wrote, calling his credibility a central issue. Students at Trump University have sued in a federal court in San Diego, claiming they were defrauded by its real estate seminars. A trial is set to begin on Nov. 28. Last month, Trumps attorneys said evidence and statements from the election campaign should be barred from the trial because they could unfairly prejudice the jury. Their request would include allegations of sexual misconduct, which Trump has denied during the campaign. Lawyers for the plaintiffs said Trumps request was far too broad, threatening to exclude a mlange of misrepresentations, falsehoods and flip-flops that would impeach Trumps credibility as a witness. In the course of the campaign, news organizations have collected and publicized practically every known Trump falsehood over the years, bringing all such statements within the gambit of Trumps motion, lawyer Brian Cochran and others wrote.  A lawyer for Trump could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday.  ",politicsNews,"November 2, 2016 ",1

Gun control groups spend millions on state ballot initiatives,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Gun safety advocates are pouring tens of millions of dollars into Maine and Nevada to support ballot initiatives that would mandate background checks for gun sales in an effort to clinch state-level victories after years of failed drives in Congress. The avalanche of money spent on supporting such initiatives ahead of the Nov. 8 vote could hand gun control organizations their biggest win since they failed to secure the passage of federal legislation after the massacre of 26 children and educators at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school in December 2012. Voters in California and Washington state will also cast ballots on gun control initiatives, and opinion polls show the measures are likely to pass in all four states.      Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun control group founded by billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, has been leading the charge, throwing its financial weight behind three of the four measures. The organization plans to spend $25 million nationwide on the issue, almost as much as the powerful National Rifle Association has spent on television advertising for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. The right to own firearms is protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and any efforts to restrict that guarantee are fought vehemently by gun rights advocates, who are highly influential within the Republican Party. Victories by gun control groups in Maine and Nevada would mean that half of the U.S. population would live in states with expanded background checks, including private sales not involving a licensed dealer. Gun control supporters say that would be a symbolic and strategically important threshold. Opponents of the measures say the laws are poorly written, would do little to combat crime and would punish law-abiding gun owners. A University of New Hampshire poll in late October found 52 percent of Maine residents support the measure and 43 percent oppose it. In Nevada, two polls in late October found a 16-percentage-point margin and a 25-point margin in favor of the initiative, respectively. The measures come in a year that voters around the United States will weigh in on 71 citizen-submitted ballot initiatives on topics ranging from marijuana legalization to raising the minimum wage, the largest number in a decade, according to Ballotpedia.org, a website that tracks voting data. Everytown described its strategy as part of an effort to copy the state-by-state tactic that helped legalize gay marriage across the United States, with Congress unwilling to pass universal background check legislation. One of the great advantages of going directly to the electorate is that you can go around the legislative bodies and make law, said Zach Silk, a consultant who has worked with Everytown in Nevada and previously helped oversee Washington states 2014 successful background-check ballot initiative. Nevada in particular has become an expensive battleground. Bloomberg has personally donated nearly $10 million to the effort there, and Nevadans for Background Checks had collected $14.3 million as of Oct. 18. That is nearly triple the $4.8 million that the leading opposition group, NRA Nevadans for Freedom, had received, all from the NRA. In Maine, supporters of background checks have outspent opponents by more than 5-to-1, with the Everytown-backed Mainers for Responsible Gun Ownership Fund reporting $5.3 million in contributions as of last week. The NRA did not respond to a request for comment on its campaign spending decisions. Critics have accused Bloomberg of trying to buy victory.  This law is convoluted and way overregulatory, said David Trahan, the executive director of the Sportsmans Alliance of Maine and a former state legislator. It reflects the person funding this initiative, Michael Bloomberg. His solutions are overkill, and they border on social engineering. But Everytowns executive director, John Feinblatt, said it was the gun lobby that has tried to take power away from the citizenry. While the NRA can control legislators and the government, they cant control the people, he said. ",politicsNews,"November 2, 2016 ",1
Clinton camp says FBI should say what it knows about Trump's Russia ties,"WASHINGTON/FT. LAUDERDALE, Fla. (Reuters) - A top aide to Hillary Clinton urged the FBI on Tuesday to disclose what it knows about any ties between Donald Trump and Russia, accusing the agency of unfairly publicizing its inquiry into Clintons email practices while staying quiet about the Republican presidential candidate. The Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a preliminary inquiry in recent months into allegations that Trump or his associates might have had questionable dealings with Russian people or businesses, but found no evidence to warrant opening a full investigation, according to sources familiar with the matter. The agency has not publicly discussed the probe. A week before Election Day, the Clinton campaign was trying to contain damage from the announcement by FBI Director James Comey on Friday that his agency was looking into newly discovered emails that might relate to Clintons use of a private server while she was secretary of state. Clinton has voiced confidence the FBI will not find anything problematic. She campaigned on Tuesday in the battleground state of Florida, where she was joined in Dade City by former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, whom Trump had mocked for gaining weight. Chants of Lock her up! from dozens of Trump supporters gathered nearby could be faintly heard while Clinton spoke. In Ft. Lauderdale, a young man who yelled, Shes a liar was escorted out of the rally. Several other protesters removed during the course of her speech. I am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and behavior from people who support Donald Trump, Clinton said as another protester was removed from the rally. Trump and other Republicans have seized on Comeys announcement, which did not indicate any wrongdoing by Clinton, to ratchet up criticism of the Democratic candidate. She leads in most opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Trump urged people on Tuesday who voted early for his Democratic rival to cancel their ballots and switch to him. This is a message for any Democratic voters who have already cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton and who are having a bad case of buyers remorse, in other words you want to change your vote, Trump told a Wisconsin rally. So if you live here or in Michigan or Pennsylvania or Minnesota, you can change your vote to Donald Trump. Several states, including those cited by Trump, have a process to allow voters who cast early ballots to change their votes, either by submitting new ballots or showing up at their polling place on Election Day.  Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook questioned why the FBI director had not released any information about the agencys Russia inquiries. If youre in the business of releasing information about investigations on presidential candidates, release everything you have on Donald Trump. Release the information on his connections to the Russians, Mook said on CNN. The FBI inquiry reviewed allegations that Trump or his associates might have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or engaged in contacts or commerce with people in Russia who are subject to U.S. or international financial sanctions.      The U.S. government has blamed Russia for cyber attacks on Democratic Party organizations. Democrats criticize Trump for taking what they say is a pro-Russia foreign policy stance. Russias possible role in the campaign again came into focus when online magazine Slate said a group of computer scientists had been alarmed by records showing thousands of apparent connection attempts between an email server operated on behalf of the Trump Organization and computers inside a Russian company, Alfa Bank in Moscow. Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said the server, which had been used to send out hotel marketing material, had been dormant for years.                Prominent U.S. cyber security company FireEye said it had been hired by Alfa Bank to investigate the records and had been granted access to the banks systems in Moscow to look for evidence of any relationship with Trumps company or any signs of hacking or infection. FireEye said so far it had found no emails being sent back and forth or any other link. Opinion polls showed Clintons lead has narrowed slightly since early last week but it was too early to say whether the email controversy was hurting her. Clinton led businessman Trump in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll of likely voters released on Monday, by 44 percent to 39 percent. Clinton, hoping to be the first woman elected president, strengthened her lead over Trump in polls after the release last month of a 2005 video in which the Republican bragged in vulgar terms about groping women.         But in a dramatic twist, Comey told Congress in a letter on Friday that the FBI was reviewing the newly discovered emails. Comey had announced in July that the FBI had completed a probe into the email practices, concluding there were no grounds to bring any charges. Clintons team has been pressing the FBI to provide details on the new trove of emails, which Comey said may or may not be significant in the case.  Little is publicly known yet about the emails, other than that they were found during an unrelated probe into former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Comeys letter has provided Republicans with fresh fodder for attack in the waning days of the campaign. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday that a Clinton presidency would bog down in scandal baggage. Congressional Republicans, who had been concerned Trump risked damaging their majorities in the House and Senate, were also encouraged by his recent statements on efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. A campaign aide said if Trump wins, he would ask Congress to begin working on legislation to repeal the law before the Jan. 20 inauguration.  ",politicsNews,"November 1, 2016 ",1
Hillary Clinton: Wall Street's favorite enemy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton began her presidential campaign by promising to do what it takes to rein in Wall Street. Boosted by Wall Streets toughest critics, U.S. senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic candidate has declared the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top and said she would raise bank fees and tighten banking regulations. She has encouraged regulators to break up too-risky banks. And yet, Wall Street appears unperturbed by the prospect of a Clinton presidency. In fact, the banking industry has supported Clinton with buckets of cash and stocks have sold off on days when the Clinton campaign stumbles. Privately, bankers say that they trust her to remain a pragmatist who will keep the current regulatory regime laid down by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform legislation passed in 2010. I dont think Clinton wakes up thinking about Wall Street, one senior banking industry lobbyist said. There are hints in apparently leaked email discussions among Clintons campaign staff that bankers are not far off the mark when they count on her to tread lightly.  Pressed during the campaign by progressive Democrats to call for a revival of the Glass-Steagall Act that would require separation of commercial and investment banking, Clinton ultimately refused. She also weighed another progressive favorite - a tax on financial transactions- but instead recommended a far narrower plan to tax only canceled orders by high speed traders. Ultimately, what bankers most like about Clinton is that she is not Donald Trump.  Many financiers fear her unorthodox Republican rival could disrupt global trade, damage geopolitical relationships and rattle markets, industry analysts and participants say. Those are the kind of things that corner offices think about, said Karen Shaw Petrou of Federal Financial Analytics Inc, whose firm advises financial firms about U.S. regulatory policy. The overriding concern about Trump has dominated peoples thinking. Trumps candidacy has upended traditional political alliances and bankers that usually contribute more to the Republicans have been flinging money at Clinton. Employees of the 17 largest bank holding companies and their subsidiaries have been sending her $10 for every $1 they contributed to Trump, according to a Reuters analysis. In 2012, the same group contributed twice as much to Republican candidate Mitt Romney as it did to President Barack Obamas re-election campaign.   People who work for hedge funds and private equity firms have contributed more than $56 million to Clintons presidential campaign and the supporting groups that face no legal cap on donations. Trumps campaign and related groups received just $243,000 from donors in the same sector, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. Its basically going with the devil you know over the devil you dont, said Brian Gardner, a managing director of New York investment firm Keefe Bruyette & Woods. What also helped, he said, was the familiarity with Hillary and Bill Clinton dating back to the 1990s when her husband was president and ushered in a period of financial deregulation. There is a closeness and a comfort level between the titans on Wall Street and the Clintons, he said. For bankers, the biggest worry is a scenario where Clinton wins and the Democrats take control of the House and the Senate, with progressives such as Warren and Sanders holding sway over everything from new tax laws to appointments of regulators. Already, Warren has called for immediate dismissal of the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White. Last year, Warren successfully led a movement to derail Obamas plan to appoint banker Antonio Weiss to the top job at Treasury. Warren and other progressives will press Clinton to be tough on Wall Street in return for their campaign support.  Clinton leaned heavily on Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and progressive ideas, when she needed to excite voters, Adam Green with the Progressive Change Campaign Committee said. Elizabeth Warren has proven shes a very powerful ally to have on your side. And its well known shes also a formidable opponent to have against you, Green said.  However, recent polls suggest it is unlikely that Democrats will take the House and the future of the Senate is far from certain. Even if the Senate goes Democratic, it is likely to be led by New York Senator Chuck Schumer, a moderate who has represented Wall Street with the industrys backing. Clinton has said she will propose a risk fee on the largest financial firms and tighten up rules which allow banks to circumvent bans on proprietary trading by investing in hedge funds. Like Trump, she has proposed to end the tax break that private equity investors enjoy, termed carried interest. Yet such provisions will be probably tied up in a much larger tax initiative that will involve months, if not a year or more, of horse trading in Washington. Ultimately, it could end up overshadowed by other progressive goals, such as infrastructure funding, college affordability, or raising the minimum wage. Those are the causes that Clinton has prioritized and they are likely to supersede her anti-bank rhetoric, say bankers. One industry trade group representative said: Were not in her top 10 to take care of. ",politicsNews,"November 2, 2016 ",1
Senator Grassley asks Defense Department to explain EpiPen spending,"(Reuters) - U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley asked the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs on Tuesday to explain spending trends for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. The request followed a recent report by Reuters detailing how EpiPen price hikes by manufacturer Mylan NV had added millions to U.S. Department of Defense spending since 2008 as the agency covered more prescriptions for the lifesaving allergy shot at near retail prices. We know the price increase for EpiPens is hitting individual consumers and Medicare and Medicaid, Grassley, a Republican, said in a statement. We need to determine whether taxpayers overpaid for the EpiPen through the Department of Defense and the VA and whether they deserve a rebate, as they do with Medicaid. Spending that isnt warranted squeezes the health care budget. Mylan agreed last month to pay $465 million to settle questions of whether it underpaid U.S. government healthcare programs by misclassifying EpiPen.  The company raised the price for a package of two EpiPens by sixfold to more than $600 over the last decade. ",politicsNews,"November 2, 2016 ",1
Moody's Analytics election model predicts Clinton win,"(Reuters) - Low gas prices and President Barack Obamas high approval ratings are key factors that favor Democrat Hillary Clinton winning the White House in next weeks election, according to a model from Moodys Analytics that has accurately predicted the last nine U.S. presidential contests. Clinton is forecast to pick up 332 Electoral College votes against 206 for Republican Donald Trump, Moodys Analytics predicted on Tuesday in the final update of its model before Election Day on Nov. 8. That would match Obamas margin of victory over Republican challenger Mitt Romney in 2012. The Reuters-Ipsos States of the Nation project also predicts a Clinton win, with a 95 percent probability of her winning at least 278 electoral votes. A candidate needs to win at least 270 electoral votes to be elected president. The Moodys Analytics model is based on a combination of state-level economic conditions and political history, and has correctly called the outcome of each presidential election since Republican Ronald Reagan unseated Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1980. Rather than focus on the individual candidates in a race, the model instead centers on whether current economic and political conditions favor the incumbent party in the White House. This year those factors point to Clinton becoming the 45th U.S. president. The economic factors Moodys measures include the two-year percentage changes in real personal income per household, as well as house and gasoline prices.  Among the political factors weighed, Moodys said the most important is the share of the vote in any one state that went to the incumbent party in the previous election. It also takes into account voter fatigue and the incumbent presidents approval ratings. This year, with Obama enjoying some of his highest job approval ratings since his first year in office in 2009 and gasoline prices holding steady at well-below-average levels, the model suggests the Democrats will win their third straight presidential election, Moodys said. That would mark the first time since the 1988 election of Republican George H.W. Bush that one party has won three consecutive presidential contests. Moodys warns, however, that its model does not take into account any individual characteristics of specific candidates. Given the unusual nature of the 2016 election cycle to date, it is very possible that voters will react to changing economic and political conditions differently than they have in past election cycles, placing some risk in the model outcome, particularly state-by-state projections, Moodys analytics economist Dan White wrote in the report.

"Republicans look to seize on revived Clinton email issue in White House, Congress races","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans are seizing on the FBIs revived scrutiny of Hillary Clintons handling of government emails, hoping it will hurt not just her presidential hopes but Democrats chances of regaining one or both chambers of Congress in next weeks election. Republican lawmakers are threatening to investigate Clinton from her first day in office if the Democrat is elected president on Nov. 8, following the FBIs move to review newly discovered emails that might pertain to a previously completed investigation into Clintons use of a private server while she was secretary of state. After FBI Director James Comeys announcement last Friday of the latest review, which indicated no wrongdoing on Clintons part, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and other Republicans have hammered Clinton as scandal-prone, seeking to renew questions about her integrity. A Clinton presidency would bog down in scandal baggage, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday, adding he was focused on defending Republican majorities in Congress in the election. This is what life with the Clintons looks like. Its always a scandal one after another, then theres an investigation, Ryan, the most senior elected Republican in the country, told Fox News in an interview. You never know whats coming next. Saying that Clinton would take office with her scandal baggage, Ryan added: I dont think thats what the American people want to see. Clinton has said she is confident the FBI will not find anything problematic and will reach the same conclusion it did in July when it found no grounds for charges from her use of a private email server. Opinion polls show Clinton maintaining her lead over Trump, although her advantage has narrowed slightly since early last week. The effect of Comeys news on voters support is not yet clear.  The University of Virginias Center for Politics said this week that several key states, including Arizona, Florida and Ohio, were now considered toss up, having earlier been classified as leaning Democratic, saying the races had been tightening regardless of any Comey Effect.  If Comeys decision results in Republicans holding onto the Senate and losing fewer House seats because he has invigorated their checks and balances argument, we will also attribute this to the Comey Effect, the centers Larry Sabato and his colleagues wrote. GRAPHIC: Race to the White House tmsnrt.rs/298mTyD Ryan maintained the arms-length posture toward Trump that he adopted after a 2005 video emerged last month in which the New York businessman was heard boasting about groping women. The Wisconsin Republican said he voted for Trump in early voting last week, but that his position had not changed and that he had no plans to campaign with his partys nominee, instead focusing on maintaining Republicans control of the House.  My focus personally right now is saving our House majority. Im going to Indiana, Michigan, New York and Virginia today to fight for House Republicans, Ryan told Fox. While Republicans appear poised to keep control of the House, the race for the Senate remains evenly matched, according to an average of polls by RealClearPolitics. Some conservative members of the Republican caucus in the House, unhappy with Ryans treatment of Trump and his handling of other issues on Capitol Hill, have questioned whether he should continue as speaker after the election. Were all focused on beating Democrats on Nov. 8. All the rest of this stuff will sort itself out, Ryan told Fox News. Im very confident where I stand with our members. Republican U.S. Senator John Cornyn called on Tuesday for Attorney General Loretta Lynch, a Barack Obama appointee, to intervene over the Clinton email probe. AG Lynch has authority to unravel Clinton email mess by appointing a special counsel who can convene an impartial grand jury, Cornyn wrote on Twitter.  Such a move would all but guarantee that controversy over Clintons emails would simmer into 2017 and perhaps beyond, potentially tying up her agenda if she were elected to the White House. Some Republican senators have already also vowed to block any hearing on Clintons potential Supreme Court justice nominees to fill the courts current vacancy. Republican House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz told the Washington Post last week he had years worth of potential material that could be used to investigate Clinton. California Republican Darrell Issa, a House Judiciary Committee member, told Fox Business Network late on Monday: I suspect there will be more hearings following the latest email probe.

Frustrated Europe hopes Clinton win can spur elusive Iran deals,"BERLIN (Reuters) - After a year of disappointment, European businesses are hoping a victory for Hillary Clinton in the U.S. election next week may help break the logjam that has prevented large-scale Western investments in Iran since the opening of its economy. While no one in Europe is predicting a flurry of new deals should Clinton defeat her Republican rival Donald Trump on Nov. 8, a win for the Democrat would remove some of the political clouds hanging over last years nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. Business groups say this could help fuel a more aggressive push into the Iranian market in 2017, especially in the second half of the year, if a Clinton victory is followed by the re-election of moderate Iranian President Hassan Rouhani next May. If Clinton and Rouhani win, then we will have a political window of opportunity that is much bigger than we have now, said Matthieu Etourneau, who advises French firms on the Iranian market for MEDEF International, the French employers group. This is what the European banks and companies are waiting for, he said. Back in January, when the United States and Europe lifted sanctions related to Irans nuclear program, the excitement in Europes business community was palpable. With a population of 78 million and annual output higher than that of Thailand, Iran was the biggest economy to rejoin the global trading and financial system since the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union. European politicians flocked to Tehran with dozens of corporate executives in tow. Rouhani, a pragmatist elected in 2013 on a platform to reduce Irans isolation, traveled to Paris and Rome to promote his country to eager investors. But within months the euphoria had vanished, replaced by frustration on both sides. The biggest obstacle for European firms seeking to do business in Iran has been the reluctance of the continents largest banks to finance deals out of fear they could run afoul of U.S. sanctions and incur massive penalties down the line. The United States has taken steps to reassure the banks. Last month the Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued new guidance to allay concerns about doing U.S. dollar transactions with Iran. But Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged at a think-tank event in London this week that banks remained skittish. German officials raised their concerns about the hurdles during a recent visit by U.S. sanctions coordinator Daniel Fried. This caution is likely to persist, regardless of who is sitting in the White House. Beyond the issue of sanctions, the poor state of Iranian banks after a decade outside the international financial system, the strong state role in the economy and a lack of clarity about the legal system are all deterrents to foreigners. Everyone knows now that this will be a long, step-by-step process to build up our economic ties, said Friedolin Strack, head of international markets at the Federation of German Industries (BDI). Still, a Clinton victory would be a reassuring signal to Europe. Her close adviser Jake Sullivan was a key figure in the secret negotiations in Oman that paved the way for the landmark agreement that curbed Irans disputed nuclear activity, and she has defended it during the election campaign. Trump, by contrast, has called it one of the worst deals ever made and promised to renegotiate it if he is elected. Bankers say the risk of the deal unraveling under a Trump presidency has contributed to the reticence in Europe. Recently however, there have been signs of movement. Smaller German banks, pressed by their clients to support them in Iran, are beginning to offer limited financing and payment services. Medium-sized banks that finance the German Mittelstand have a great deal of interest in Iran business and are preparing the groundwork intensively, said Siegfried Utzig, acting head of economic policy and international affairs at the Association of German Banks (BvB). We can see the light at the end of the tunnel but its still quite far away. In June, the German government began offering export credit guarantees via insurance group Euler Hermes for firms wanting to trade with Iran. Edna Schoene, head of German government business at Euler Hermes, said about 30 formal applications had been received since then with a total value of about 2.5 billion euros. Nine of them have been approved. Add to that roughly 70 non-binding letters of interest (LOIs) that have been issued and the volumes push up into the double-digit billions of euros, Schoene said. The potential in Iran is enormous and the demand for export credit guarantees is high, both in terms of formal applications and expressions of interest, Schoene said. I expect that we will see the first large-scale, credit-financed deals in 2017. Some European firms are already benefiting from the opening of the Iranian economy. Last week French carmaker PSA Group (PEUP.PA), once the market leader, announced it had produced 105,000 cars in Iran under the Peugeot license in the third quarter, 15 percent of its total sales volume. Etourneau of MEDEF International is also optimistic that Irans order of 118 jets from Europes Airbus (AIR.PA) and a recent joint venture deal between carmaker Renault (RENA.PA) and Iranian investment fund IDRO will prove a boon for smaller European suppliers.    MEDEF International announced last month it was opening an office in Tehran, its first outside France, to support small and medium sized French firms seeking to enter the Iranian market. We expect that 20-30 billion euros in public contracts to be attributed by the Iranians before the end of their fiscal year in March, Etourneau said. What we are telling companies is that they need a 5-10 year strategy. The market will open up progressively. ",politicsNews,"November 1, 2016 ",1
U.S. issues travel advisory for India amid fears of Islamic State attacks,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The U.S. embassy in New Delhi issued a security message to American citizens in India on Tuesday to be vigilant following reports that Islamic State may be planning to attack targets there. Recent Indian media reports indicate ISILs desire to attack targets in India, the advisory said, warning of an increased threat to places frequented by Westerners such as religious sites, markets and festival venues. ISIL is an acronym for the jihadist organization, which has seized territory in Iraq and Syria. All U.S. citizens are reminded to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness, the advisory said. Officials from the National Investigation Agency, Indias counter-terrorism unit, has been quoted as saying that an Indian man arrested last month in Tamil Nadu and charged with terrorism offences had been an active member of Islamic State in Iraq.

"In Ohio, a spelling error could cost you your vote","COLUMBUS, Ohio/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Voting is no easy task for Roland Gilbert. The 86-year-old retired Ohio lawyer, who is legally blind, completes his absentee ballot with help from a machine that magnifies the print. So the registered Democrat was not completely surprised to learn he had made an error in filling out his 2014 ballot, entering that days date in the birthdate field. What surprised him was that it cost him his vote. Local election officials rejected it because it did not perfectly match his registration information on file. It didnt seem right, Gilbert said. I felt foolish for making a silly mistake. Laws passed by the Republican-led Ohio state legislature in 2014require voters to accurately fill out their personal information onabsentee or provisional ballotsor they will be rejected - even if the votes are otherwise valid. The laws are being applied in a presidential election for the first time this year. A Reuters analysis found that where a voter lives can determine whether their provisional or absentee ballot counts in Ohio. The law requiring a perfect match on information such as name, address, birthdate, signature and ID number has been enforced unequally county to county, federal data and court documents show, with local officials sometimes using wide latitude in applying the standards. The disparity could hurt Democrats in Ohio, a vital battleground in the Nov. 8 election between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. The 14 Ohio counties with the most restrictive enforcement accounted for 53 percent of Ohios total vote in 2012 and gave Democratic President Barack Obama 60 percent of the votes he won in Ohio. More than half of the provisional and absentee votes discarded for minor errors in 2014 came from five large, Democratic-dominated urban counties: Lucas, home to the city of Toledo; Cuyahoga, which includes Cleveland; Franklin, home to the state capital, Columbus; Summit, which includes Akron, the fifth-largest city in the state; and Hamilton County, home of Cincinnati. While the number of votes rejected for technical reasons was small in the 2014 congressional election, when nearly 3,000 absentee and provisional ballots were thrown out, those totalsare likely to swellin a presidential election, when more people will vote. The number of discarded ballots could go even higher in Ohio after a court ruled that tens of thousands of voters who had been purged from the state voter rolls can cast provisional ballots, expanding the possible pool of disputed votes. A provisional ballot is used to record a vote when there are questions about a voters eligibility. Election boards, split evenly between Republicans and Democrats in Ohio, then examine the provisional ballots to determine if the vote should count. There are going to be thousands of indisputably registered and eligible voters in Ohio who are going to be disenfranchised solely because they made trivial, immaterial errors and omissions on forms, said attorney Subodh Chandra, who has led a court challenge to the laws on behalf of a homeless coalition and the Ohio Democratic Party. A federal district judge threw out the provisions requiring a perfect match on personal information as discriminatory earlier this year, but most were later restored by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeals courtdid remove the requirementthat voters accurately fill in their address and birthdate on the absenteeform - any vote cast by mail or in person prior to Election Day - but kept the requirement for the other fields onboth types of ballots. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected without explanation a request for an emergency stay of the appeals court ruling that would have allowed ballots with those technical mistakes to be counted. A spokesman for Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, said the 2014 laws were aimed at finding a balance between making it easy to vote and hard to cheat and that officials were striving to be more consistent in the laws application. The office has issued a directive that mistakes in the address and birthdate fields of provisional ballots should not be the sole basis for rejection if a board can still identify the voter. Chandra and other critics say the Ohio laws are aimed at low-income and minority voters who move more often and have less flexibility with schedules, making them more likely to cast absentee or provisional ballots. They also are more likely to back Democrats. Its a clever scheme to shave off Democratic votes, said Chandra, arguing the laws create a modern-day literacy test by requiring voters to read, write and understand voting forms without making any errors or leaving out information. Republican backers of the Ohio law reject the claims of racial or partisan bias. It is just nonsense, said Ohio State Senator Bill Coley, lead sponsor of one of the bills. We arent trying to disallow their ballot, we are trying to make sure that every ballot that is cast was cast by an actual registered voter and you are cutting down on opportunities for shenanigans. U.S. Election Assistance Commission records show Democratic-leaning Franklin, the states second-largest county, was the most strict in 2014, throwing out 651 ballots for technical errors including missing or incorrect Social Security numbers, zip codes, birthdates, cities or street names. Officials tossed five ballots because the voter wrote their name in cursive. Another seven were rejected because the voter mixed up two digits of their Social Security number, the federal data showed. Some 256 were rejected because the voter did not provide a birthdate. We are not allowed to do anything other than what the law says, said David Payne, deputy director of the Franklin County Board of Elections. We cant be arbitrary. In Democratic-leaning Lucas County, the elections board rejected an absentee ballot in 2014 because the street name was misspelled as Cuthberth rather than Cuthbert, according to evidence presented in the lawsuit.  Many smaller, heavily Republican rural counties did not reject any ballots for those reasons. In Wyandot County, ballots examined for the lawsuit found officials approved ballots without a valid street address, city or zip code, a wrong or missing birthdate, or a misspelled name. Were not monsters. We want to count everybodys vote, saidDeb Passet, elections director for Wyandot County, a sparsely populated county south of Toledo where Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney won 59 percent of the vote in 2012. Election officials in rural, Republican-leaning Adams County are also more likely to forgive voters who make a mistake.If there is an opening and they can help the voter out, thats the way they will go, said Mary Fannin, director of the countys board of elections. Other states have tried to introduce similar exact-match information requirements. Georgia and Wisconsin also faced recent challenges that led to adjustments in laws requiring voters to provide letter-perfect personal identification information. The battle over the Ohio law is just one of several voting rights disputes complicating election forecasts in the state. In the last year, courts have also allowed the state to eliminate a period of early voting, known as Golden Week, when voters could register and cast a ballot on the same trip - a convenience that has been popular with minority voters. People should not have to jump through all these hoops to get their votes counted in Ohio, said Ohio Democratic Rep. Kathleen Clyde. ",politicsNews,"November 1, 2016 ",1
Exclusive: U.S. stopped Philippines rifle sale that senator opposed - sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department halted the planned sale of some 26,000 assault rifles to the Philippines national police after Senator Ben Cardin said he would oppose it, Senate aides told Reuters on Monday. Aides said Cardin, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was reluctant for the United States to provide the weapons given concerns about human rights violations in the Philippines. News of the thwarting of the weapons sale was met with disappointment among the Philippine police and government on Tuesday, but they said alternative suppliers would be found. Police spokesman Dionardo Carlos said the Philippines had yet to be notified about the sale being stopped.        The relationship between the United States and the Philippines, a long-time ally, has been complicated lately by President Rodrigo Dutertes angry reaction to criticism from Washington of his violent battle to rid the country of illegal drugs. More than 2,300 people have been killed in police operations or by suspected vigilantes in connection with the anti-narcotics campaign since Duterte took office on June 30. The U.S. State Department informs Congress when international weapons sales are in the works. Aides said Foreign Relations committee staff informed State that Cardin would oppose the deal during the departments prenotification process for the sale of 26,000-27,000 assault rifles, stopping the deal. U.S. State Department officials did not comment. Ronald dela Rosa, the Philippine national police chief and staunch supporter of the war on drugs, said he liked the American rifle, but suggested China as an alternative small-arms provider.  We really wanted the U.S. rifles because these are reliable, he told broadcaster ABS-CBN. But if the sale will not push through, we will find another source, maybe from China. In October, Duterte told U.S. President Barack Obama to go to hell and said the United States had refused to sell some weapons to his country, but he did not care because Russia and China were willing suppliers. According to some U.S. officials, Washington has been doing its best to ignore Dutertes rhetoric and not provide him with a pretext for more outbursts. An open break with the Philippines could create problems for the United States in a region where Chinas influence has grown. ",politicsNews,"October 31, 2016 ",1
"In rare move, China criticizes Trump plan to exit climate change pact","BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Tuesday rejected a plan by U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to back out of a global climate change pact, saying a wise political leader should make policy in line with global trends, a rare comment on a foreign election. The world is moving towards balancing environmental protection and economic growth, Chinas top climate change negotiator told reporters, in response to a query on how China would work with a Trump administration on climate change. .   . If they resist this trend, I dont think theyll win the support of their people, and their countrys economic and social progress will also be affected, Xie Zhenhua said. I believe a wise political leader should take policy stances that conform with global trends, Chinas veteran climate chief said. Trump has threatened to reject the Paris Agreement, a global accord negotiated by nearly 200 governments to battle climate change that takes effect on Friday. Chinese officials are often hesitant to weigh in on foreign elections, although they will defend Chinese policies when attacked in candidates policy platforms. Xies comments come as China plans to launch a national carbon trading scheme in 2017. The scheme is on track and pilot programs have already traded 120 million carbon allowances with total transactions amounting to 3.2 billion yuan ($472.29 million), he added. It will take time for the market to be fully operational, but once its operational, itll be the largest carbon trading market in the world, said Xie. Chinas coal consumption has declined as the worlds second-largest economy slows, but Xie said it was too early to decide if it had peaked. Chinas delegation of more than 80 negotiators will begin departing from Tuesday for global climate change talks in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh set for Nov. 7 to 18.

Clinton holds five-point lead as FBI looks at more emails: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton held a five percentage point lead over Republican rival Donald Trump, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Monday, down only slightly since the FBI said last week it was reviewing new emails in its investigation of the former secretary of state. Some 44 percent of likely voters said they would support Clinton, while 39 percent said they would support Trump, according to the Oct. 26-30 survey. Clinton had held a 6 point advantage over Trump in the five-day tracking poll last Thursday. Other polls have shown Clintons lead slipping more sharply. Real Clear Politics, which averages the results of most major polls, shows that Clintons lead has declined from 4.6 points on Friday to 2.5 points on Monday.   Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey told Congress in a letter made public on Friday that his agency was looking into new emails that may be connected to Clinton, who had been probed by the FBI over her use of a private server and how she handled classified information while Americas top diplomat. The FBI has revealed very little to the public about the new emails under investigation, except that they were uncovered during an unrelated investigation into the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide.  In July, Comey concluded that Clinton and her staff were extremely careless with their handling of classified information, but that there was not enough evidence to bring criminal charges. On Friday, Comey told Congress, We dont know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails.  In a separate poll that included alternative-party candidates, 43 percent supported Clinton, while 37 percent supported Trump, 6 percent supported Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and 1 percent supported Jill Stein of the Green Party. The polling determines likely voters according to a number of factors including voting history, registration status and stated intention to vote. It assumes that 60 percent of eligible Americans will vote. The result of the 2016 election will vary greatly depending on how many voters actually cast a ballot. Currently, Clinton leads Trump in both high and low turnout scenarios, according to the latest poll. Her advantage holds at 5 points if 55 percent of eligible voters participate, and it rises to 6 points if 70 percent of Americans cast a ballot. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It included 1,264 people who were considered likely voters under the assumption that 60 percent of eligible voters would participate. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"October 31, 2016 ",1
Uproar over whether FBI chief broke law by raising new Clinton emails,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Whether FBI Director James Comey broke the law may hinge on whether he had political motivations or was merely doing his job by reviving Democrat Hillary Clintons email controversy just days before the Nov. 8 presidential election. Richard Painter, a chief White House ethics lawyer to former Republican President George W. Bush, on Saturday accused Comey of violating the 1939 Hatch Act when the FBI chief wrote Congress on Friday that more of the candidates emails would be scrutinized.  On Sunday, U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid wrote to Comey to accuse him of partisan actions that may have broken the law. The Hatch Act bars government employees from taking part in political activities that include soliciting or accepting donations from a political party and using official authority to interfere with the outcome of an election.  Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said, I would be surprised if this complaint leads to anything significant, but I would also be surprised if Comeys tenure as the FBI director will not be shortened. Even if he didnt violate the letter of the Hatch Act, he certainly violated the spirit of the Hatch Act, which should have prompted him to think twice before issuing that letter. Especially because the letter didnt say anything, he said. Little is publicly known about the new email trove. Comey wrote Congress the FBI had yet to determine the significance. Painter filed his complaint with the independent Office of Special Counsel (OSC) and the Office of Government Ethics. A spokesman for the OSC, which has a specialized Hatch Act investigative unit, declined to comment. A Hatch Act investigation is an administrative, not a criminal, matter. Penalties may include removal from office, a demotion or temporary suspension, or a civil penalty no higher than $1,000. In cases of high-level officials, the disciplinary decisions on OSC actions are made by the president. On Monday, the White House said President Barack Obama believes Comey is a man of integrity and is not trying to influence the election by announcing the scrutiny of additional emails. Jan Witold Baran, a lawyer at Wiley Rein in Washington, suggested it would be hard to construe what appeared to be Comeys engagement in normal government business as a violation of the Hatch Act.  But Kenneth Gross, former associate general counsel of the Federal Election Commission, said Comeys letter fell outside the FBI directors normal duties as there is no legal obligation to disclose details of an ongoing probe to Congress. Painters complaint said that barring extraordinary circumstances, a public communication about a pending FBI investigation involving a candidate for public office so close to an election likely violated the act. Comey said in an internal memo obtained by news media that even though it is not common to update Congress on the progress of investigations, he felt obligated because he had repeatedly said the probe was completed. The OSC Hatch Act unit, which usually experiences a surge in complaints during election years, has disciplined 84 employees the last five years, almost a three-fold increase over the previous five years, an OSC 2015 report to Congress said.  Hatch Act violations usually relate to inappropriate electioneering. For example, the 2015 report cited a complaint against a U.S. Agriculture Department official who allegedly asked two subordinate employees to donate to a political action committee supporting Obamas 2012 re-election.  In a 2016 letter, the OSC found that Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro violated the act by advocating for and against presidential candidates during a media interview. Castro called it an inadvertent error. ",politicsNews,"October 31, 2016 ",1
Democrats sue Trump for alleged voter intimidation in four states,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic Party officials sued Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in four battleground states on Monday, seeking to shut down a poll-watching effort they said was designed to harass minority voters in the Nov. 8 election. In lawsuits filed in federal courts in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona and Ohio, Democrats argued that Trump and Republican Party officials were mounting a campaign of vigilante voter intimidation that violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act and an 1871 law aimed at the Ku Klux Klan. Trump has sought to advance his campaigns goal of voter suppression by using the loudest microphone in the nation to implore his supporters to engage in unlawful intimidation, the Ohio Democratic Party wrote in a legal filing. Similar language was used in the other lawsuits. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Since August, Trump has urged his supporters to monitor polling locations on Election Day for signs of possible voting fraud, often urging them to keep a close eye on cities like Philadelphia and St. Louis that have high minority populations. Campaigning in Ohio, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said Trump was hoping to discourage people from participating in the election.   His whole strategy is to suppress the vote. Lots of noise. Lots of distractions, Clinton said in Cleveland. Democrats are also trying to stop the Republican National Committee from working with the Trump campaign or state parties on poll monitoring, arguing in a separate case that a long-standing court order prevents the national party organization from engaging in ballot security measures. In a motion filed on Monday in that case, the RNC said it was not involved in poll watching but was working to support Trump in other areas. That is evidence of politics, not wrongdoing, the RNC said. Many states allow campaigns and political parties to monitor balloting, although they often face restrictions. In Pennsylvania, for example, poll watchers must be formally certified by the local election board and must be registered voters in the county where they are working. The state Republican party has sued to remove those restrictions. With early voting under way, civil rights groups have said they have heard isolated reports of self-described poll monitors photographing voters and engaging in other intimidating behavior.  Democrats also sued Republican operative Roger Stone, a longtime Trump ally who is organizing an exit-polling effort. Democrats said the true purpose of the project, called Stop the Steal, was to intimidate minority and urban voters.  Stone told Reuters that his project was designed to ensure that electronic voting machines were working properly. On Stop the Steals website, Stone says Clintons Democrats intend to flood the polls with illegals. Liberal enclaves already let illegals vote in their local and state elections and now they want them to vote in the Presidential election. Stone said the 1,400 people across the United States who volunteered for the project had been instructed to use neutral language and only approach people after they had voted.  Since we are only talking to voters after they have voted, how can we be intimidating them? Stone said. ",politicsNews,"October 31, 2016 ",1
Trump raises specter of crisis if Clinton wins the White House,"GRAND RAPIDS, Mich./KENT, Ohio (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump called Democratic rival Hillary Clinton a threat to the country on Monday, saying that if she is elected a probe into her emails could shadow her entire term in office, as the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Clintons lead narrowing slightly. The investigation will last for years. The trial will probably start, Trump told a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Nothing will get done. I can tell you, your jobs will continue to leave Michigan. Nothings going to get done. The Federal Bureau of Investigation on Friday said it was investigating newly discovered emails that might relate to Clintons use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. Clinton on Monday again said she was confident that the FBI would not find anything problematic in her emails and would reach the same conclusion they did earlier this year. It wasnt even a close call, she said at a rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, of the FBI investigation. But just eight days ahead of the election - a time when candidates typically feel that the hard work of the campaign is behind them - both Clinton and Trump have ratcheted up their attacks on the others character and fitness for office. Clinton, who had been riding high in opinion polls in recent weeks as Trump was hit by fallout from the release of a 2005 video in which he bragged in vulgar terms of groping women, now finds herself on the defensive. Trump is hoping to convince voters that electing Clinton would prompt a constitutional crisis that we cannot afford, as her emails would be subject to years of controversy, in the wake of the FBIs announcement on Friday that it continues to investigate material possibly related to her emails.  Clinton on Monday continued to level attacks against Trumps ability to control nuclear weapons. I am running against someone who says he doesnt understand why we cant use nuclear weapons, she said in Cincinnati. He wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. I wonder if he even knows that a single nuclear warhead can kill millions of people, she added. Little is publicly known yet about the emails being investigated, other than that they were found during an unrelated probe into the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide.  FBI Director James Comey told members of Congress on Friday the agency was probing more emails that might relate to Clintons use of a private email server, but added, We dont know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails. Trump, who has repeatedly referred to Clinton as corrupt Hillary, on Monday said the email probe shows what a poor role model she is - seemingly trying to turn the tables on Clinton, who has assailed his character over disclosures of vulgar comments he made about groping women. I want to tell you, she is a terrible example for my son and the children of this country, he said in Warren, Michigan, mentioning his youngest son, Barron. Hillary is the one who broke the law over and over and over again. (For graphic on race to the White House, click tmsnrt.rs/298mTyD) Until the Friday revelation, Clinton had been coasting with a comfortable lead over Trump. Opinion polls now shows Clintons lead over Trump has narrowed slightly since early last week. It is not yet known if the email controversy will hurt her support. Millions of Americans have already cast their ballot in early voting. Clinton holds a 5 point lead over Trump in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, receiving 44 percent of likely voters compared to Trump at 39 percent.  Despite the controversy about her email, Clinton continues to hold a large advantage in the Electoral College, the process that selects a president by awarding votes through individual state elections. Clinton holds leads in several key swing states, including Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, where Trump must erode a large lead to be victorious. The FBI spent a year investigating Clintons use of a private email server, instead of government systems, while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Comey concluded in July that while Clinton and her staff had been extremely careless in handling classified information there were no grounds for any charges.        Comey, roundly criticized by Republicans for his decision not to recommend charges against Clinton at the end of the FBI probe in July, has now drawn the ire of senior Democrats. U.S. Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, accused him of a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another. He said, without providing evidence, that the FBI was keeping explosive information under wraps about ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook called reports that the FBI would not discuss whether the Russian government was behind the hacking of Democratic email accounts because it was too close to the election a blatant double standard.         In an August letter, Reid asked Comey to investigate whether Trump allies have worked with the Kremlin to influence the election, citing reports that a foreign-policy adviser had met with Putin allies on a July trip to Moscow and longtime Republican operative Roger Stone had been in touch with WikiLeaks. The White House steered clear on Monday of direct criticism of Comey, who was appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2013. Obama views the FBI head as a man of integrity and does not believe he is secretly trying to influence the outcome of the election, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters.

Tech billionaire Thiel says Trump movement 'not going away',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Billionaire technology investor Peter Thiel, a lightning rod for criticism in Silicon Valley for his support of Donald Trump, predicted on Monday that the movement the Republican presidential nominee has created would carry on even if he loses his bid for the White House on Nov. 8. No matter what happens in this election, what Trump represents isnt crazy, and its not going away, Thiel said in a speech to reporters at the National Press Club in Washington.  Thiel, who announced earlier this month he was donating $1.25 million to help Trump get elected, said the New York businessman was laying the groundwork for a new Republican Party that will go beyond the dogmas of Reaganism. Thiel attacked Washington in his remarks, saying its elite insiders were out of touch with ordinary Americans and that Trump was shaking up a system in need of change.         The truth is, no matter how crazy this election seems, it is less crazy than the condition of our country, said Thiel. While it is impossible to predict what will happen to Trump and his followers after the election, Thiel is not alone in his view. This will certainly continue after Nov. 8, whether Donald Trump is leading the movement or not, Republican strategist Alice Stewart said on Monday, arguing that the movement surrounding Trump will have lasting effects on the Republican Party. Without a doubt, Trump has tapped into an electorate that has felt like their voices have not been heard in quite some time, she said, adding that the Republican Party old guard would have to work with followers of Trumps newer brand of conservatism, regardless of the outcome of the election, if the party is to survive. Thiel, who was born in Germany and came to the United States as a child, is best known as a co-founder of online payment service PayPal Holdings Inc and an early backer of online social network Facebook Inc. His support for the real estate developer and reality TV star has made him a target for scorn in liberal-leaning tech circles, especially after his full-throated endorsement of Trump at the Republican National Convention in July. The only major-name Trump backer in Silicon Valley, Thiel has attracted criticism and some have called for Thiels removal from Facebooks board. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has insisted on Thiel staying, citing the importance of diversity of opinion at the company.  Trumps tirades against cross-border trade agreements and immigration run counter to the views of most in the U.S. tech industry, which sells its products worldwide and has leaned heavily on talented programmers coming to the United States from overseas.  On Monday, Thiel accused the media of taking too literally many of Trumps more controversial proposals, including imposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country and building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. He also said the comments Trump made about groping and kissing women in a 2005 video that was made public earlier this month were clearly offensive and inappropriate.  But Thiel said he and other Trump supporters were voting on policy, not personality. He added that both Trump and White House rival Democrat Hillary Clinton were imperfect people, to say the least.  On top of his political views, Thiel has faced a backlash in the media for secretly funding a lawsuit against the online publishing company Gawker Media by former professional wrestler Terry Bollea, known professionally as Hulk Hogan, that ultimately led to the bankruptcy and sale of Gawker.  Thiel on Monday defended his decision to bankroll the suit against the site, which a decade earlier outed Thiel as gay in an article entitled Peter Thiel is totally gay, people. Thiel said the judicial system was too costly for all but the very rich. If youre a single-digit millionaire like Hulk Hogan, you have no effective access to the legal system, he said. Clinton holds a 5-point lead over Trump in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, with the backing of 44 percent of likely voters compared to Trump with 39 percent.  ",politicsNews,"October 31, 2016 ",1
"CNN, Brazile part ways amid renewed WikiLeaks controversy","NEW YORK (Reuters) - CNN cut ties with political commentator and interim Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile after leaked emails suggested she offered advisers to Hillary Clinton advance information about presidential debate questions, the news network reported on Monday. Brazile came under fire earlier this month after a hacked email published by WikiLeaks showed she may have tipped off the Democratic presidential nominees campaign about a March CNN town-hall debate question about the death penalty. CNN announced her departure after a subsequent leaked email showed she said she was privy to questions in advance and offered to send a few more. Brazile had offered the network her resignation earlier this month, CNN reported. Brazile previously denied allegations that she gave the Clinton campaign information about debate questions ahead of time, according to media reports. Brazile, currently serving as interim head of the DNC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment but posted several tweets on Monday as the news broke. Thank you @CNN, Brazile tweeted. Honored to be a Democratic strategist and commentator on the network. Godspeed to all my former colleagues. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized CNN, alleging it is biased against his campaign. A Clinton spokesman said in an email the campaign would not comment on the authenticity of any individual emails that have been hacked by the Russian government. FBI Director James Comey said on Friday the agency was probing more emails that might relate to Clintons use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.

U.S. attorney general did not order FBI to withhold Clinton-related emails: source,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch did not order FBI Director James Comey to withhold from Congress the discovery of emails potentially related to the investigation into Hillary Clintons email server, but she made it known that she thought his decision violated department policy, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday. As Comey and Lynch aides debated last Thursday whether alerting Congress about the emails would comply with longstanding Justice Department policy against announcing overt investigative steps that would influence an upcoming election, Comey asked whether he was being explicitly directed not to do so. Lynch never gave Comey the order not to send the emails, a senior government official said. Comeys letter on Friday notifying members of Congress that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had discovered new emails apparently pertinent to the Clinton server probe has upended the presidential race and given new hope to Republican candidate Donald Trump that he can make a comeback and win on Nov. 8. Lynchs office informed the FBI on Thursday that sending the letter conflicted with a memo containing official guidance that is sent to all Justice Department employees during presidential election years, according to the official.  The memo instructs employees to never select the timing of investigative steps... for the purpose of affecting any election.  But the Justice Department made no effort to block the FBI from obtaining a search warrant to review the emails, which the agency received on Sunday. The department is working closely with the FBI on the case. Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik told several members of Congress in letters on Monday that the Justice Department was dedicating all necessary resources to work with the FBI on its examination of the newly discovered emails as expeditiously as possible. However, an official familiar with the FBI review said investigators could not predict how long the examination would take. Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, sent Comey a letter on Monday accusing the FBI of keeping explosive information under wraps about ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Reid wrote to the FBI in August, requesting information about those ties, including alleged meetings between a Trump adviser and several high-ranking sanctioned individuals in Russia in July, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters. The FBI acknowledged that it received the letter and said it had replied to Reids office. An aide to Reid said he was not aware of any response from Comey to the letter.

Got bank? Election could create flood of marijuana cash with no place to go,"October 31 (Reuters) - Although the sale of marijuana is a federal crime, the number of U.S. banks working with pot businesses, now sanctioned in many states, is growing, up 45 percent in the last year alone. Still, marijuana merchants say there are not nearly enough banks willing to take their cash. So many dispensaries resort to stashing cash in storage units, back offices and armored vans. Proponents believe the Nov. 8 election could tip the balance in favor of liberalizing federal marijuana laws, a move seen as key to getting risk-averse banks off the sidelines.  Measures on ballots in California, Florida and seven other states would bring to 34 the number of states sanctioning pot for medical or recreational use, or both. That could push annual sales, by one estimate, to $23 billion. The prospect for a market of such scale is adding urgency to calls for a national approach to marijuana that expands banking options. Law enforcement and Federal Reserve officials have expressed concern about the fraud and crime associated with un-bankable cash. Nearly 600 dispensary robberies have been reported in Denver since recreational pot was legalized in Colorado three years ago. Theres not a single human being who thinks there is any benefit at all in forcing marijuana business to be conducted on an all-cash basis, said Rep. Earl Blumenauer, a Democrat from Oregon who has called for the decriminalization of marijuana since coming to Congress in 1996. The U.S. Justice Department said in 2014 it would not prosecute banks for serving state-sanctioned marijuana businesses. At the same time, the Treasury Department requires banks to report suspected drug crimes. At last count, 301 banks were serving marijuana businesses, according to the Treasury Department. Many more have avoided the sector out of fear that making the wrong call could put them at risk, said Robert Rowe, a vice president at the American Bankers Association. The National Cannabis Association is pressing Congress for a law that would hold banks harmless for handling pot cash, said Michael Correia, a lobbyist for the trade group. If California legalizes recreational use next week, the nations biggest Congressional delegation will have a big stake in the issue. In lieu of federal action, some states have tried their own fixes. Colorado created a credit union system for state-sanctioned marijuana businesses. But it fell apart when the Kansas City Federal Reserve denied a Colorado pot credit union access to the national payments system, which distributes currency and clears checks and electronic payments. California has no such plans, said Tom Dresslar, spokesman for the states Department of Business Oversight. This was a problem created by federal law, Dresslar said, and it needs a federal solution. In northern California, where growers serve state-sanctioned medical dispensaries as well as the black market, the Community Credit Union of Southern Humboldt stopped opening pot business accounts because of the red tape and uncertainty, said senior vice president Janet Sanchez. Were not being asked to go over to the gun dealer and ask them if theyre making appropriate background checks, she said. Dispensary operators unable to find willing banks tell tales of subterfuge, recordkeeping nightmares and armies of security guards. Many open bank accounts and submit credit card charges in ways that obscure their true enterprise, such as spa services. Susana de la Rionda has run a Los Angeles medical marijuana dispensary for 12 years and has had to find a new bank about once a year and submit to tax audits twice as often. I feel like a gangster, she said. Denver Relief dispensary founder Ean Seeb said operators always are trying workarounds to get cash into banks, including washing bills in fabric softener to hide the odor of pot. For a time, he said, one automated teller machine near a Denver mall drew lines every night of marijuana merchants, each depositing the maximum $500 in cash. Partner Colorado Credit Union began working with state-sanctioned dispensaries two years ago and has developed elaborate protocols to minimize risk, including an initial vetting that can take three weeks. It uses armored trucks to take cash deposits directly from dispensaries to the Denver branch of the Federal Reserve Bank. When the credit union spots a red flag, Chief Executive Sundie Seefried dispatches employees to pay the dispensary a visit, and she has closed two accounts for compliance problems. Seefried encourages operators to visit by keeping fine cigars in her office, and she stays in touch with regulators. Our program is designed with eyes on the business, eyes on the owner, eyes on the money, she said. With 95 dispensary members, Seefried said the credit union is at capacity, and she hopes more bankers will get involved. She fields calls for advice, speaks to industry groups and, earlier this year, shared what shes learned in a book. Despite the safeguards, Seefried said she takes nothing for granted. Every few months, she said she drills her staff to make sure they know what to do in the event of her arrest. What calls are you going to make? she said she asks them. If you dont have a little fear going into this because of the illegality at the federal level, youre probably not the person to do this job, she said. ",politicsNews,"October 31, 2016 ",1
Backers of Paris climate pact play down Trump threat to deal as election looms,"OSLO (Reuters) - Backers of a global accord to fight climate change that formally comes into force on Friday say they are confident the deal can survive any legal challenges by U.S. Republican candidate Donald Trump if he wins next weeks presidential election. Trump has threatened to reject the accord negotiated by nearly 200 governments, including that of U.S. President Barack Obama. Trump once tweeted that global warming was a concept invented by the Chinese to harm U.S. industry. By contrast, his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has strongly supported the plan, which enters into force after major greenhouse gas emitters the United States, China and India ratified it. The Paris Agreement aims to phase out man-made greenhouse gases in the second half of the century to avert floods, heatwaves, droughts and rising sea levels.   Delegates from signatory nations meet in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh on Nov. 7-18 to start turning their many promises on tackling climate change into action and draw up a rule book for the sometimes fuzzily worded accord reached last December. Adding urgency, 2016 is set to be the hottest year since records began in the 19th century. The U.S. election, on Nov. 8, injects a large dose of political uncertainty into the gathering of environment ministers and senior officials in Marrakesh. The relatively speedy ratification of the climate pact, a year before many predictions, was partly driven by Trumps threats to reject the accord. Some delegates played down the risk of a President Trump reneging on the deal. The momentum is such that it would take a heck of a climate skeptic to back pedal, said Tosi Mpanu Mpanu of the Democratic Republic of Congo, who heads the group of 48 Least Developed Countries at the Morocco negotiations. Thats really why we have had this strong mobilization (to ratify). If Trump wins I dont think it will change anything. Moroccan Environment Minister Hakima El Haite, who will host the Marrakesh meeting, said he did not expect Trump, if elected,  would challenge the agreement, saying the American people were generally supportive of climate action. And, as a businessman, (Trump) will understand that climate change is an opportunity to create jobs and new technologies, she told Reuters recently in New York. Its entry into force gives some protection for the Paris Agreement under international law. Its Article 28 says any government wanting to quit has to wait through four years of formalities - the length of a U.S. presidential term. If he wins, Trump is likely to focus his efforts domestically on undoing Obamas plans to cut U.S. emissions, such as from coal-fired power plants. The Paris Agreement also helped to unlock U.N. accords this year to limit emissions from airlines and from powerful greenhouse gases used in air conditioners and refrigerators. There has been astonishing progress on climate change after years of deadlock, said Andrew Steer, head of the World Resources Institute think-tank. The global pacts contrast with more nationalist forces that helped Trump to win the U.S. Republican nomination for president and, on the other side of the Atlantic, Britains vote in June to leave the European Union. The Paris Agreement enters into force after passing a threshold last month of ratification by 55 nations representing 55 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. The tally is now 87 nations representing about 60 percent of emissions. The United States alone accounts for 18 percent of global emissions. Under a Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Trump could not renounce the U.S. share and then argue that the entire entry into force was invalid. Entry into force only goes one way. It cant be reversed, said Elliot Diringer, executive vice-president of the non-partisan Center for Climate and Energy Solutions in Washington.  But there could be legal challenges. The U.S. Republican Party platform says Obama, a Democrat who used his executive powers to ratify the agreement, should have submitted it to the Senate, where it would almost certainly have been rejected. Governments in Marrakesh will try to bolster the pact, which sets many goals for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 or 2030. Governments are under pressure to spell out what they will do now rather than leave it to their successors. At its core, the Paris Agreement promises to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. But current pledges for limiting emissions are too weak and will allow temperatures to rise by perhaps 3C (5.4F) or more by 2100. Diplomats expect it will take two years or more to write a rule book for the accord. Among difficulties, the Agreement lets all countries set their own targets for emissions. That free-for-all design helped ensure wide support but is at odds with a need for a central set of rules to monitor and report greenhouse gas emissions from factories, cars, farms and power plants. Irrespective of the rules, the prices of renewable energies are falling sharply, prompting a shift from fossil fuels.  U.S. climate envoy Jonathan Pershing said wind and solar energy accounted for two-thirds of all new electricity generating capacity installed in the United States in 2015. The U.S. solar industry now employs more people than coal, he said. Still, Trump says he will promote the U.S. coal and oil industries to safeguard domestic jobs and national security. He says a shift from fossil fuels would force the United States to be begging for oil again from Middle East suppliers. ",politicsNews,"October 31, 2016 ",1
Petition of White House to reverse Navy ratings change tops threshold,"(Reuters) - A petition to the White House to halt the U.S. Navys abolition of sailors traditional ratings that are more than two centuries old has topped 100,000 signatures, above the number needed for an official response, according to the online petition site. The petition was launched within hours after Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson said on Sept. 29 that the Navy would do away with such ratings as gunners mate and boatswains mate. The plan to abolish the 241-year-old job titles system and replace it with one similar to other armed services occupational specialty codes has sparked outrage among some current and former Navy personnel. One by one current leadership continues to erode the very things that set the Navy apart from the other services. Mr. President, I and the others signing this petition request you use your authority to restore to our Sailors what they have earned, the petition said. The request topped 100,000 signatures within 30 days, the requirement needed for official action by President Barack Obamas administration. The online site showed a total of 102,597 signatures on Monday. Officials say the switching of titles would allow the Navy to identify sailors skills more accurately and give them better job opportunities when they leave the Navy. The changes followed a review this year. The modernization plan will be implemented in multi-year phases, the Navy has said. Opponents have voiced their anger on Richardsons Facebook page. Carrie Herr wrote on Saturday, Help our Navy enlisted (personnel) restore the honor and tradition that was taken away from them. Save Navy ratings! Richardsons office and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the petition. ",politicsNews,"October 31, 2016 ",1
Syrian political opposition says hopes Clinton wins U.S. presidency,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Syrias political opposition hopes Hillary Clinton wins the U.S. presidential election next week because she has a better understanding of the conflict than Donald Trump, according to members of a delegation holding talks at the United Nations. Khaled Khoja and Hind Kabawat, in Geneva on Monday to press for U.N.-led negotiations on the release of Syrian detainees, said they trusted Clinton, a former U.S. Secretary of State, to deliver on the oppositions top priority - protecting civilians. Clinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and safe zones on the ground in Syria to protect non-combatants. Trump says this could lead to World War Three due to the potential for conflict with Russia, which is providing military support to President Bashar al-Assad. Kabawat said Trump, who has never held public office and has no foreign policy experience, saw Islamic State, also known as ISIS, as the only alternative to Assad in Syria.  For us a womans leadership at this time would be a good thing. Also for many, like Trump and others, they think that the Syrian conflict is comparing Assad with ISIS and they have to take one side or the other, and of course for them Assad will look more prominent than ISIS, said Kabawat.  She (Clinton) knows that is wrong. She knows that there is this moderate opposition that believes in democracy and freedom. This is what we are aiming for, to have a president of the U.S. with good experience who knows the difference between the different oppositions. Assad, whose forces have regained much territory against their opponents with the help of Russian warplanes, has branded all those opposed to his rule as terrorists.  Trump has said defeating Islamic State should be a higher priority than trying to persuade Assad to step aside, a departure from a long-held U.S. policy objective. Khoja, leading the Syrian opposition delegation in Geneva, disagreed with this viewpoint. Dealing with only the ISIS issue will not help with solving the crisis in Syria or the region because the root cause of the crisis is the (Assad) regime itself, he said. Kabawat, an attorney and a member of the opposition High Negotiations Committee, added that the Syrian political opposition wanted to see women playing an equal role to men in the nations politics. The opposition delegation, which has links to the Free Syrian Army but not with Islamic State or al Qaeda-linked groups, is in Geneva this week to revive the issue of prisoner releases, sidelined during months of fruitless peace talks. Khoja said more than 100 armed groups had shown their willingness to cooperate but there had been no sign of cooperation from Assads government or Russia, adding that the United Nations should form a committee on the matter. If its needed, if there is a response from the regime side to release the detainees and stop killings inside Syria, then we can have the representative of the military groups also in this committee, and if the regime wants to send someone to this committee, we can discuss it, Khoja said.  The Syrian Network of Human Rights has documented more than 90,000 detainees held by the Syrian government, 6,000 held by Islamic State and 2,400 held by the rest of the opposition, but estimates the real numbers are twice as high.

FBI obtains warrant to examine Clinton emails,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal investigators have secured a warrant to examine newly discovered emails related to Hillary Clintons private server, a source familiar with the matter said on Sunday, as a prominent Democrat accused FBI Director James Comey of breaking the law by trying to influence the election. The warrant will allow the Federal Bureau of Investigation to examine the emails to see if they are relevant to its probe of the private email server used for government work by Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Comey came under heavy pressure from Democrats on Sunday to quickly provide details of the emails, as Clinton allies worried the prolonged controversy could extend beyond the Nov. 8 election and cast a shadow over a Clinton transition if she wins the White House. Comeys disclosure of the email discovery in a letter to Congress on Friday plunged the final days of the White House race between Clinton and Republican Donald Trump into turmoil. Clinton had opened a recent lead over Trump in national polls, but it had been narrowing even before the email controversy resurfaced. The unexpected turn in the email controversy shook  financial markets conviction of a Clinton victory in the election and the U.S. dollar slipped against major currencies in early Asian trading on Monday. U.S. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid sent a letter to Comey on Sunday suggesting he violated the Hatch Act, which bars the use of a federal government position to influence an election. Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law, Reid, a senator from Nevada, said in the letter to Comey. Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook questioned Comeys decision to send a letter notifying Congress of the email review before he even knew whether they were significant or relevant. Comeys letter was long on innuendo, short on facts, Podesta said on CNNs State of the Union program, and accused the FBI chief of breaking precedent by disclosing aspects of an investigation so close to the election. We are calling on Mr. Comey to come forward and explain whats at issue here, Podesta said, adding the significance of the emails was unclear. He might have taken the first step of actually having looked at them before he did this in the middle of a presidential campaign, so close to the voting, Podesta said. Comeys letter was sent over the objections of Justice Department officials. But those officials did not try to stop the FBI from getting the warrant, a source familiar with the decision said, because they are interested in the FBI moving quickly on the probe. Sources close to the investigation have said the latest emails were discovered as part of a separate probe of former Democratic U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Weiner is the target of an FBI investigation into illicit text messages he is alleged to have sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The FBI already had a warrant to search Weiners laptop in that probe, but needed a warrant to look at the material that might be related to Clinton. Sources familiar with the matter said FBI agents working on the Weiner investigation saw material on a laptop belonging to Weiner that led them to believe it might be relevant to the investigation of Clintons email practices. Trump has highlighted the issue as proof for his argument that Clinton is corrupt and untrustworthy. We have one ultimate check on Hillarys corruption and that is the power of the vote, Trump told a rally in Las Vegas on Sunday. The only way to beat the corruption is to show up and vote by the tens of millions. Comey, who announced in July that the FBIs long investigation of Clintons emails was ending without any charges, said in his letter the agency would review the newly surfaced emails to determine their relevance to the investigation of her handling of classified information. Richard Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School and the chief White House ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007, said he filed a complaint over Comeys actions with the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates Hatch Act violations. We cannot allow F.B.I. or Justice Department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway. That is an abuse of power, he said in a column in the New York Times. But Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches at Columbia Law School, called the allegations that Comey improperly tried to influence the election inane. Comeys critics cannot show his letter violated the Hatch Act unless they can prove that the FBI director was intending to influence the election rather than inform Congress, which was Comeys stated aim, said Richman, who said he had advised Comey on law enforcement policy but not this issue. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released on Sunday showed Clinton with a statistically insignificant 1-point national lead on Trump. About a third of likely voters in the poll said they were less likely to back Clinton given Comeys disclosure. Clinton, who told a Florida rally on Saturday that Comeys letter was deeply troubling, did not address the issue directly on Sunday but referred vaguely to voters overcoming a distraction. Theres a lot of noise and distraction but it really comes down to the kind of future we want and who can get us there, she told a packed gay nightclub in Wilton Manors, Florida, where hundreds of supporters who could not get in lined the streets outside. We dont want a president who would appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn marriage equality, she said. ",politicsNews,"October 30, 2016 ",1
Cuba ballet festival reflects diplomatic pas de deux with U.S.,"HAVANA (Reuters) - A woman in a floaty dress wrestles a minotaur who reflects her inner demons in Errand into the Maze, one of the Martha Graham Dance Company works that made its Cuban premiere this weekend to thunderous applause at the Havana ballet festival. The troupe was performing in the Communist-run island for the first time since 1941 and is one of seven American companies participating in the 10-day event, underscoring greater U.S.-Cuban cultural exchange in the wake of the countries detente. The standing ovation said it all, said a beaming Cuban spectator, 64-year-old Maria Antonia Armas. It was fabulous. I just hope this exchange will continue to flow.  The Cuban and American ballet worlds have a deeply entwined history and the founding father of Cuban dance, Ramiro Guerra, studied under Graham in New York in the 1940s. Yet ties suffered during the five decades of ideological hostility following Fidel Castros 1959 revolution. We keep hearing there is a Martha Graham world in Cuba that we have been apart from for decades, the companys artistic director, Janet Eilber, said in an interview. We know it has evolved in its own way and in New York we have evolved in our own way, so to come together and meet our long lost relatives has been very interesting. While there have been some exchanges between Cuban and American dance in the last two decades, the detente announced nearly two years ago is enabling a broader opening, Eilber said. For one, it has made traveling and securing financing much easier, she said. Regular commercial flights were re-established in August and American companies such as Jetblue are keen to provide sponsorship in order to gain market recognition in Cuba. Cuban spectators said the modern and contemporary U.S. choreographies performed during the opening weekend of the 25th Havana ballet festival were like a breath of fresh air.  While Cuban ballet has fused the best from the Russians, French, Italians, English and Americans with Latin flair and Afro-Cuban sensuality, its style has also been criticized as outdated. It is based on the approach of the Ballet Nacional de Cubas 94-year-old founder, Alicia Alonso, a principal dancer in the 1940s with the company now known as American Ballet Theater. Alonsos choreographies to classics like Swan Lake, Giselle and Sleeping Beauty feature heavily throughout the biannual festival, which from this year onwards will be named after her. New York City Ballet choreographer Justin Peck, who brought four works to the festival, said he aimed above all to keep pushing the envelope. Classical ballet is an evolution so it should take certain careful steps forward, the 29-year old told a news conference. Peck and others said it was a treat to perform in a society where the public is so enthusiastic about their art. Ballet may not be avant-garde in Cuba but it is mainstream entertainment, with tickets costing less than half a dollar and performances shown on public television. They have one of most sophisticated palates for ballet, for dance and for art in the world, said Peck. Dancers and companies representing sixteen countries in total will participate in the festival, including for the first time South Koreas Universal Ballet Company and the lead dancer from the National Ballet of Mongolia.

Trump mounts bid to turn Clinton controversy to his advantage,"PHOENIX (Reuters) - Sensing a potential turning point, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump mounted a furious effort on Saturday to portray Democrat Hillary Clinton as unfit to lead the country after the latest chapter in her email controversy unfolded as he tries to mount a comeback. With the Nov. 8 election only 10 days away, Trump devoted much of his stump speech to try to take the maximum advantage of the FBIs disclosure that it is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Clintons use of a private email server. Little is known about the extent and focus of the new FBI review. But Trump was quick to declare his rival guilty at rallies in Phoenix and in Golden, Colorado, declaring that she is symbolic of a type of public corruption that is a grave threat to our democracy. Trump charged that the Justice Department, populated by appointees of Democratic President Barack Obama, is trying to help Clinton, given news reports that top department officials did not want FBI Director James Comey to reveal his new review. When the outcome is fixed, when the system is rigged, people lose hope. They stop dreaming. They stop trying, Trump said in Phoenix. Hillary Clintons corruption is corrosive to the soul of our nation and it must be stopped. Clinton herself has repeatedly attacked Trump as not fit to be president. The new uproar could not have come at a more opportune time for Trump, who has been reeling for weeks from the release of a 2005 audio tape in which he boasted about groping women and the emergence of a host of women who said he did just that to them. Trump has narrowed the gap in public opinion polls between him and Clinton nationally and in some battleground states where the election is likely to be decided. But most analyses of the polls show him facing a defeat, perhaps a landslide, if the election were to be held today.  That made it essential for Trump to try to change the subject from his own setbacks and focus on those of Clinton, and give establishment Republicans who have been reluctant to support him a reason to get behind him, and perhaps sway some undecided voters as well. Still, the Phoenix rally provided a reminder why some Republicans cannot bring themselves to support Trump, as a man there taunted reporters with a chant of Jew S. A. when the rest of the crowd was chanting USA. Trumps next couple of days on the campaign trail reflect a change in strategy with uncertain rewards. He is to campaign in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Sunday and in Michigan on Monday,  two states that have voted Democratic in recent presidential elections and appeared poised to do so again.

Clinton takes on FBI director in latest email flap,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla./GOLDEN, Colo. (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton on Saturday challenged FBI Director James Comey to provide a fuller explanation of investigative steps he is taking related to her use of a private email server, as the Democratic presidential candidate accused him of deeply troubling behavior 10 days before the U.S. elections. Speaking to volunteers in Daytona Beach, Florida, Clinton said: Some of you may have heard about a letter the FBI director sent on Friday to the U.S. Congress informing it that the agency is again reviewing emails. Comey had decided in July that the FBI was not going to seek prosecution of Clinton for her handling of classified materials on a private email server while she was secretary of state. It is pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election, Clinton said, adding, Its not just strange, its unprecedented and its deeply troubling because voters deserve to get full and complete facts. She urged Comey to put it all out on the table. In tandem with Clinton, fellow Democrats on Saturday also worked to pressure Comey to provide details on a controversy that dominated the presidential campaigns on Saturday, less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 elections. Four U.S. senators - Patrick Leahy, the longest-serving Senate Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, Thomas Carper and Benjamin Cardin - wrote Comey and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch asking that they provide by Monday more detailed information about investigative steps underway. At a press conference in Columbus, Ohio, the Congressional Black Caucus, comprised of about 45 members of the House of Representatives, nearly all Democrats, also urged Comey to be more forthcoming. Sources close to the investigation on Friday said the latest emails were discovered as part of a separate probe into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Weiner, a former Democratic U.S. congressman from New York, is the target of an FBI investigation into illicit text messages he is alleged to have sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump pounded away at the new FBI development, devoting a large part of a campaign speech in Golden, Colorado, to attacking Clinton and arguing that she is not to be trusted with the presidency. Her criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional and purposeful, Trump said, standing in front of hay bales stacked in a horse barn. Hillary set up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her illegal actions from public disclosure and exposure. Comey, however, has not provided any details on whether the emails now under review are being seen for the first time by the FBI or the nature of their contents. Clintons campaign team tried to downplay the new review. Theres no evidence of wrongdoing, no charge of wrongdoing, said John Podesta, who heads the Clinton campaign, referring to the FBIs latest announcement that it was taking appropriate investigative steps after learning of emails that appear to be pertinent to the earlier Clinton email probe. In some of his toughest language on Saturday, Podesta portrayed Comeys letter to Congress as light on facts, heavy on innuendo. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, trying to tamp down speculation of a voter backlash this late in the campaign, said Americans had already factored what they knew about the email investigation into how they would cast their ballots. We dont see it changing the landscape for undecided voters, Mook said. Clinton aides also said this latest controversy has further energized her supporters. Clinton did a campaign swing through Florida as she and Trump were thought to be in a tight race in a state famous for its role in close presidential elections. Many analysts believe this battleground state is essential for Trump to win in order to have any chance of being elected. In recent weeks, Trump has been running behind Clinton in most public opinion polls. Singer and actor Jennifer Lopez was scheduled to headline a free concert in Miami on Saturday for Clinton supporters. The Clinton campaign hopes that J.Lo, as she is known by fans, will provide celebrity star power and help Clinton connect with young voters who earlier this year flocked to Democratic primary challenger Bernie Sanders. Justice Department officials, according to a source who asked not to be identified, were opposed to the FBI directors letter being sent to Congress and believe his actions conflict with a Justice Department memo outlining instructions that agencies should not to act in ways that could influence elections. While Lynch did not discuss the matter directly with Comey, the source said aides were in touch with each other. Comey let it be known he felt he had to send the letter as a follow-up to his congressional testimony earlier this year regarding the FBIs probe of Clintons emails, the source said. During his speech in Golden, before flying to Arizona to campaign, Trump accused the Obama administrations Justice Department of trying to protect Clinton from prosecution. The attorney general didnt want anything to happen to Hillary. I wonder why. Its very sad. Folks, were living in a third world country, Trump said. ",politicsNews,"October 29, 2016 ",1
Kerry says has not been contacted by FBI over new Clinton email review,"AHERLOW, Ireland (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday he had not been contacted by the FBI about new investigative steps being taken related to Hillary Clintons use of a private email server when she led the State Department.  The FBI on Friday said it was investigating more emails in what the Democratic presidential candidate described as deeply troubling behavior 10 days before the U.S. elections. I havent been notified of anything, no, I havent been requested of anything, no, Im not aware of the department being requested, and I have no further comment to make, Kerry told a news conference in Ireland. As an American citizen and former nominee of the party, there is a lot Id like to say about what is going on, but I cant and I am just going to remain out of this, he added. Clinton on Saturday challenged FBI Director James Comey to provide a fuller explanation of investigative steps he is taking related to her use of a private email server.  Comey had decided in July that the FBI was not going to seek prosecution of Clinton. But on Friday he said the agency was trying to determine whether additional emails contained classified information. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has been reeling for weeks from the release of a 2005 audio tape in which he boasted about groping women, has seized on the FBI move as evidence Clinton is unfit to lead the country. Kerry was in Ireland to accept the Tipperary International Peace Award, joining recipients like former South African President Nelson Mandela, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Kerry is due to travel to London on Monday for talks on Libya that will seek to break a political stalemate over the countrys U.N-backed unity government. ",politicsNews,"October 30, 2016 ",1
Clinton enjoys solid lead in early voting: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - With 11 days to go before the U.S. presidential election, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican Donald Trump by 15 percentage points among early voters surveyed in the past two weeks, according to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project. Though data is not available for all early voting states, Clinton enjoys an edge in swing states such as Ohio and Arizona and in Republican Party strongholds such as Georgia and Texas. An estimated 19 million Americans have voted so far in the election, according to the University of Floridas United States Election Project, accounting for as much as 20 percent of the electorate. Overall, Clinton remained on track to win a majority of votes in the Electoral College, the Reuters/Ipsos survey showed. Having so many ballots locked down before the Nov. 8 election is good news for the Clinton campaign. On Friday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that it is examining newly discovered emails belonging to Clintons close aide, Huma Abedin. Those emails were found on a computer belonging to Anthony Weiner, Abedins estranged husband, during an unrelated investigation into illicit messages he is alleged to have sent to a teenage girl. The Reuters/Ipsos survey was conducted before the news emerged Friday afternoon. It remains unclear whether the FBI inquiry will upset the balance in the race. The bureau disclosed nothing about the Abedin emails, including whether any of the messages were sent by or to Clinton. Over the summer, the FBI said it was closing its investigation into Clintons use of a private email system while secretary of state. Until Friday, her campaign seemed to have weathered the initial FBI email probe. Clinton has held a lead averaging four to seven percentage points in polls in recent weeks as the Trump campaign wrestled with accusations by women of groping and other sexual advances. Trump has said none of the accusations are true. He also struggled in the recent presidential debates and faced questions about his taxes. As of Thursday, Clintons odds of receiving the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency remained at greater than 95 percent, according to State of the Nation polling results released Saturday. The project estimated she would win by 320 votes to 218, with 278 votes solidly for the Democrat. Clintons lead among early voters is similar to the lead enjoyed by President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney at this point of the 2012 race, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken at the time. Obama won the election by 332 electoral votes to Romneys 206. But even before the latest email news, it had been a difficult week for Clinton. News coverage of Trumps accusers had diminished, while Clinton confronted the almost daily release by WikiLeaks of emails purportedly hacked from her campaign managers account. This weeks leaked messages raised questions about former President Bill Clintons finances. And her lead in the States of the Nation project fell slightly from last week. Though the projected Electoral College votes hardly moved, the number of states solidly for Clinton slid from 25 to 20 this week. Trump didnt see any additional states tilt solidly to him, but he did see some gains: The swing states of Pennsylvania, Colorado, Iowa and Nevada all moved from leaning to Clinton to being too close to call. Still, Trumps path to a victory is narrow, and any realistic chance rests on his winning Ohio, North Carolina and Florida. As of Thursday, Ohio remained a toss-up. Florida and North Carolina were still tilting toward Clinton, according to the States of the Nation results. Early voting data for Florida and North Carolina was not yet available this week. In Ohio, Clinton led Trump by double digits among early voters. The projects broader polling suggests the state is deadlocked between the two candidates. In Arizona, Clinton also was solidly ahead among early voters. In the past month, Arizona has gradually moved from a solid Trump state to a marginal Clinton state, although it is still too close to call, according to the project results. In Georgia, she enjoyed a similar lead among early voters. Overall, Georgia leans to Trump, but his lead narrowed to five percentage points this week, down from eights points last week and 13 points a month ago. Even in Texas, where Trump enjoys a sizable lead, Clinton has a double-digit edge among early voters, according to project results. The States of the Nation project is a survey of about 15,000 people every week in all 50 states plus Washington D.C.

Clinton adds pop of celebrity in homestretch of campaign,"MIAMI (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, whose buoyant position in opinion polls has been threatened by a surprising new twist in the saga over her emails, on Saturday harnessed some celebrity star power she hopes will help win the battleground state of Florida on Nov. 8. Musician and actor Jennifer Lopez headlined a free concert in Miami as part of a star-studded effort to get out the vote and energize volunteers. Were at a crossroads and we have to take the right road to the future, Lopez shouted to screaming fans in rain gear who danced through rain and a shower of red, white and blue confetti. The concert provided some visual counter-programming to the latest email snafu to roil Clintons race to win the White House. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Friday it is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Clintons use of a private email system - a late-breaking surprise that will likely continue to get extensive media play leading up Election Day. Clintons campaign has said she is taking the news in stride, and on Saturday she lashed out at FBI Director James Comey over the review. The JLo event was the first of three high-profile concerts in states Clinton wants to keep from Republican rival Donald Trump, and it gave the former secretary of state a chance to connect with the key demographic of millennials she has sometimes struggled to reach. If we turn out, we win, Clinton told the crowd. Celebrity-driven events like the concert can serve as a bit of a distraction from the controversy, said Eric Kasper, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. It is a way to kind of take the edge off things because it tends to be more positive, Kasper said. Next week, Clinton will take the stage with Jay Z in Cleveland, and then with Katy Perry in Philadelphia on Nov. 5. A Harvard University poll this week showed that among likely voters aged 18 to 29, Clinton is leading Trump, a celebrity in his own right who starred in the reality television show The Apprentice. But turnout is a concern. The exceptionally negative tone of this years race for the White House has turned off young Americans, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows. Presidential candidates have long sought to create buzz with help from celebrity pals, said Tevi Troy, who chronicled the strategy in his book What Jefferson Read, Ike Watched, and Obama Tweeted: 200 Years of Pop Culture in the White House. Campaigns do it to reach out to people who are not necessarily interested in politics but are interested in pop culture, said Troy, a presidential historian who worked in the George W. Bush White House. The events are like a larger version of a campaign yard sign, a way to show a groundswell of support behind a candidate - and a way to appeal to fans of the musicians,  Kasper said. It can create a kind of psychological connection that we otherwise might not have when a politician endorses a presidential candidate, for instance, Kasper said. ",politicsNews,"October 29, 2016 ",1
Factbox - How Carlos Danger got tangled up in the Clinton email scandal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former U.S. congressman, has emerged as an unexpected figure in the Federal Bureau of Investigations inquiry into Hillary Clintons handling of classified government information on a private email server she used while secretary of state. The FBI said on Friday it is examining newly discovered emails related to the server investigation, giving new life to a scandal less than two weeks before Clinton stands as the Democratic candidate in the U.S. presidential election. The FBI called Clintons handling of government secrets extremely careless in July after a year-long investigation, but recommended against criminal charges. FBI agents have now found emails on devices belonging to Huma Abedin, one of Clintons closest aides, and Weiner, Abedins estranged husband, according to unnamed law enforcement officials. A Brooklyn native, Weiner, 52, represented parts of New York City in the U.S. House of Representatives for more than a decade, and his marriage to Abedin was officiated by Bill Clinton, the former U.S. president and Hillary Clintons husband. Weiner was best known for his fiery speeches and acerbic, combative wit until 2011, when he was forced to step down after he posted a photograph of his crotch on Twitter. He admitted the picture was a private communication made public by mistake, and that he had been exchanging sexually charged pictures and messages with multiple women. After atoning in press interviews for the strain he placed on his marriage with Abedin, Weiner re-entered public life in 2013 as a candidate for mayor of New York City. The citys voters for a while embraced his comeback, and he was atop the public polls when revelations broke he had never shaken his sexting habit. He admitted he had continued to swap messages and pictures with women using the alias Carlos Danger. Abedin, who has worked for Clinton since she was 19, decided against joining her husband at the polling booth on the day of Weiners loss in the mayoral race, but remained married to him as they raised their young son together. While a diminished Weiner worked as a television commentator, Abedin, who had left the State Department with Clinton in 2013, focused on Clintons forthcoming presidential campaign, for which she was appointed vice chairwoman. Clinton rarely appears in public without Abedin somewhere nearby. Multilingual, intensely private and with a glamour validated by Vogue magazine photo shoots, Abedin became a star in her own right as Clinton campaigned across the country, obliging countless requests by Clinton supporters to pose for their smartphone cameras.  No, and this year it reached a breaking point. In August, Abedin announced she was separating from Weiner after a newspaper published a picture Weiner sent to a woman of him lounging on his bed in his underwear; Weiners and Abedins four-year-old son could be seen at his side. The FBI began investigating after it emerged that one of his sexting partners was 15 years old, a legal minor. The agency seized devices used by both Weiner and Abedin, finding the new email cache soon after. Investigators are looking to see if yet more classified information appears in the new cache. Yes. Clintons Republican rival for the presidency has devoted his last few rallies to reveling in the news, a diversion from accusations by multiple women that Trump groped them. Clinton, who remains ahead in public polls, argued on Friday that most voters may have already decided whether or not Clintons mishandling of classified information in her emails is disqualifying. Clinton has called Abedin, 40, a surrogate daughter, and the aide was at Clintons side even after the news broke on Friday. Her loyalty to Clinton is unmistakable in the hundreds of emails of hers that have already been made public. Abedin has spent more than two decades accruing knowledge of Clintons habits, preferences, scheduling and alliances, and may be viewed as irreplaceable.   ",politicsNews,"October 29, 2016 ",1
Clinton email problem resurfaces as FBI announces review,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The FBI is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Hillary Clintons use of a private email system, it said on Friday, in a new twist that could damage the Democratic candidate in the 2016 presidential race. Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said in a letter to senior lawmakers that the agency would determine whether the additional emails contained classified information, adding that he did not know how long it will take us to complete this additional work. The announcement came as Clinton and Republican opponent Donald Trump enter the final stretch of campaigning ahead of the Nov. 8 election.  In a news conference late on Friday in Des Moines, Iowa, Clinton urged Comey to release more details about what the FBI was looking for in the newly discovered emails. She leads Trump in opinion polls after a bruising campaign in which she has struggled to convince voters that she is trustworthy and honest. Fresh revelations about her use of email are unlikely to assuage those concerns, and questions around the FBI investigation will now likely dog her in the coming days as she campaigns across battleground states. U.S. stocks immediately fell sharply on the news, but went on to partially recover. The FBI spent about a year investigating Clintons use of the unauthorized server at her home in Chappaqua, New York, while she was U.S. secretary of state after classified government secrets were found in some of her emails.  Comey said in July that while there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. Although Comey recommended no criminal charges be brought against Clinton, Trump has repeatedly said her email practices are criminal and should disqualify her for office. He seized on Fridays development at rallies in Maine and New Hampshire. This is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and Im sure it will be properly handled from this point forward, Trump told a crowd in Lisbon, Maine. We hope that all, all justice will be fully served, he said. Supporters cheered his words and chanted, Lock her up. Clinton said she had learned of the newly discovered emails from news reports.  Im confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July, she said. Thats why its incumbent upon the FBI to tell us whats going on. Two sources close to the investigation said the latest emails were discovered not during an investigation into Clinton, but rather as part of a separate probe into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The FBI has been investigating illicit text messages allegedly sent from Weiner to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and found the Clinton emails on a device related to that investigation, the sources said. Abedin told federal investigators in April that she used several email accounts for her work, including a Yahoo email, according to a summary of the interview released by the FBI in September. She said it was difficult to print from the State Departments email system so she routinely forwarded documents to her private accounts when she needed to print them out, according to the summary.  Abedin announced her separation from Weiner in August after a sex scandal similar to an earlier incident that led him to resign from the U.S. Congress. Lawyers representing Abedin did not respond to questions sent by email on Friday. Weiner did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment, and he did not respond to phone calls. Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic strategist who had previously advised former President Bill Clinton but has no role with Hillary Clintons campaign, said the linking of Clintons email woes with Weiners sex scandals made it harder for her campaign to distinguish itself from Trumps sex scandals. The whole campaign is now smeared with sex, corruption and scandal, he said. Nobody remembers the beginning of something, they only remember the end. What are they going to remember? Theyre all the same: sex, scandal, corruption, emails. People are going to have trouble sorting out all this information. Clintons campaign chairman, John Podesta, said it was extraordinary for the FBI to release the letter so close to the end of a hotly contested election. The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining, Podesta said in a statement. We are confident this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in July.  Clinton has repeatedly apologized for using the private email server in her home instead of a government email account for her work as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. She has said she did not knowingly send or receive classified information. While the FBI probe of new emails will likely prove a distraction to Clinton in the coming days, it was unclear what impact it would have when Americans go to the polls. Election experts say about 20 percent of ballots have already been cast, as more Americans vote by mail or go to the polls early. A lot of concern about the emails has already been baked into this electoral cake I think, said Linda Fowler, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. They know she did it, they know it was inappropriate and, failing some sensational revelation on Nov. 6, its hard to see that its going to make that big a difference. Still, Republican lawmakers, who are facing a difficult fight to keep their majorities in both the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives, leaped to condemn Clinton. House Speaker Paul Ryan reiterated his call that the Democratic nominee be barred from briefings involving classified information until the investigation is over. Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, said the FBIs decision to look into the emails shows how serious this discovery must be.    Clinton did not respond to reporters shouted questions about the news when she left her plane for a campaign stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. U.S. stocks declined in a volatile session on Friday but partially recovered from the sharp drop spurred by the FBI announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed the day down about 9 points, or .05 percent, while the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was unchanged on the day. The dollar also fell against major currencies.

Clinton leads Trump 42 to 36 percent as he loses women's support: poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clintons lead over Republican rival Donald Trump widened to 6 percentage points in the latest Reuters/Ipsos U.S. presidential tracking poll, released on Friday, showing Trump losing support among women. The Oct. 21-27 opinion poll shows 42 percent of people who either voted already or expect to vote in the Nov. 8 election support Clinton, versus 36 percent for Trump. Clintons lead a week ago was 4 points. The polling was conducted before Clintons campaign was hit on Friday by the FBI announcement that it was investigating more emails as part of a probe into her use of a private email server while secretary of state.  FBI Director James Comey said in a letter to several congressional Republicans that the agency had learned of the existence of emails that appeared to be pertinent to its investigation. However, he said the FBI did not know if the emails were significant and did not provide a time frame for the probe. (GRAPHIC: Race to the White House tmsnrt.rs/298mTyD)    Trump, a New York businessman seeking his first elected office, has consistently trailed Clinton in the poll. His level of support has remained below 40 percent among all likely voters since the beginning of September. Clinton leads Trump by 10 points among likely women voters, up from a 4-point lead the previous week. Clinton has led Trump among women over the last two months, though the size of her advantage has varied widely from 1 point to 11 points. In a 2005 video that emerged this month, Trump could be heard bragging in vulgar terms about groping and kissing women.  At least a dozen women have since publicly accused him of making unwanted sexual advances. Trump denies the allegations.  Trump still has an edge among white women, a key source of strength for Republicans. Trump leads Clinton by 2 points with this group, down from a 12-point lead the previous week. Women tend to lean Democratic, but Reuters/Ipsos polling this month shows a majority of women have an unfavorable view of the former U.S. secretary of state and believe she is not honest and truthful.     Clinton also led Trump by 6 points in a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll that included alternative party candidates.  Both polls, conducted online in English in all 50 states, included 1,627 American adults who were considered to be likely voters from their voting history, registration status and stated intention to vote. That sample included 965 likely women voters and 776 likely white women voters. Individual responses were adjusted to reflect the overall U.S. population.  The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the total sample and 4 percentage points for the women voters. The RealClearPolitics website, which tracks most major polls, shows Clinton leading Trump by an average of 5 percentage points.  ",politicsNews,"October 28, 2016 ",1
"Three in Florida, Virginia charged with voter fraud","(Reuters) - Officials in Florida and Virginia filed voter fraud charges against three people in apparently unrelated cases on Friday, just 11 days before American voters cast ballots in the hotly contested presidential race. The charges targeted a Florida woman and a Virginia man accused of filing bogus voter registration forms and a Florida woman 	alleged to have tampered with absentee ballots she was opening at the Miami-Dade Elections Department. In the Iowa capital of Des Moines, county election officials referred three cases of suspected voter fraud to police earlier this week, leading to one arrest on Thursday, police said. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has charged in recent weeks that the election will be rigged in favor of Democrat Hillary Clinton, though he has shown no proof for these claims and many Republicans have called them unfounded. Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle in Florida said that 74-year-old Gladys Coego had been working as an absentee ballot opener when a supervisor allegedly saw her changing ballots that had been left blank to support a mayoral candidate. Prosecutors said that Coego admitted to marking the ballots and was charged with two felony counts of marking or designating the ballot of another. The integrity of the electoral process is intact because our procedures work, said Christina White, the countys election supervisor, in a statement. Tomika Curgil, 33, was charged with five felony counts of submitting false voter registration information for allegedly handing in forms filled out by fictitious voters while working on a voter-registration drive for a medical marijuana advocacy group. A Virginia man was also charged with submitting falsified forms while working for a voter-registration campaign, state prosecutors said. Vafalay Massaquoi, 30, was arraigned on two felony counts of forging a public record and two counts of voter registration fraud. There is no allegation that any illegal vote was actually cast in this case, said Virginia Commonwealths Attorney Bryan Porter. Furthermore, since the fraudulent applications involved fictitious people, had the fraud not been uncovered, the risk of actual fraudulent votes being cast was low. Neither Coego, Curgil nor Massaquoi could be reached for immediate comment. Police in Des Moines on Thursday arrested a woman who was accused of voting twice - casting early-voting ballots at two locations - in one of three cases of suspected voter fraud reported by the Polk County Auditors Office. Police did not disclose the political affiliation of the woman, identified as Terri Lynn Rote, 55, but the Des Moines Register newspaper reported she was a registered Republican. A man in Texas, where early voting started on Monday, was arrested on Monday on charges of electioneering and loitering near a polling place, public records show.  The man, Brett Mauthe, had been charged for showing up to vote in a Trump hat and T-shirt with the phrase basket of deplorables, a reference to a comment Clinton made disparaging her rivals supporters, election officials told media.

Trump looks for boost from Clinton's new email problem,"CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump shifted quickly on Friday to take advantage of a new twist in Democrat Hillary Clintons long-running email saga, seeking a much-needed boost in the campaigns waning days. The FBIs disclosure that it is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Clintons use of a private email server gave fresh energy to Trump. At rallies in New Hampshire, Maine and Iowa, Trump hit hard on his message that Clinton is a corrupt leader who cannot be trusted and he pulled back a bit on his charge that the political system is rigged against him. Trump called the new development part of the biggest political scandal since Watergate, the 1970s scandal that forced the resignation of Republican President Richard Nixon. Trump abruptly changed his tune after repeatedly attacking FBI Director James Comey in the last three months for not indicting Clinton for her handling of classified information while U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. As you know, Ive had plenty of words about the FBI lately, but I give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong. Justice will prevail, Trump said in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Trump has spent weeks railing about a rigged system, accusing the Clinton campaign of coordinating attacks on him with the U.S. news media after a 2005 video surfaced of him boasting about groping women. It might not be as rigged as I thought, Trump told a crowd in Manchester, New Hampshire. By Cedar Rapids, however, he was still criticizing the corrupt political class and calling the news media dishonest. At each stop, Trumps supporters cheered loudly and chanted lock her up when the New York businessman talked about Clintons new headache, a sign that his boosters see the importance of some good news for his campaign with 10 days left until the Nov. 8 election. Trump noted that he is competitive in opinion polls nationally and in some states where the election is likely to be decided, but admitted he has got some distance to go. The new disclosures, he said, might help him. We have gaps but we are really moving and I just wanted to say that because I dont know whats going to happen now, he said.

Clinton ad blitz outpaces Trump as his Super PACs bow out,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the crucial last weeksof the U.S. presidential campaign, Democrat Hillary Clinton has dramatically widened her advantage over Republican rival Donald Trump in ad spending, according tocampaign finance reports releasedonThursday. The newest filings showed Clintonscampaign and Super PAC outspending Trump in the first three weeks of October by a factor oftwo to one on everything from national TV ads to local outreach on smartphone screens. At the same time, the two Super PACs associated with Trumps White House bid have seen their fundraising start to stall out, with one of the groups reserving no broadcast or cable ads between Oct. 20 and Election Day, according to data from ad-tracking firm SMG Delta. Clinton and Priorities USA, the Super PAC that supports her, have spent $360 million on all types of advertising since the beginning of the campaign,saidthe new reports, which covered spending through Oct. 19. That totalblows away the $147million spent on advertising by Trump and his two affiliated Super PACs during the same period. Whats more, forthe period beginning Oct. 20 and running throughthe Nov. 8election, Clinton and her Super PAC have reserved an additional $55 million in TV ads, according to SMG Delta, including $30.5 million from her campaign and $25 million from her Super PAC. A Super PAC is a fund-raising group that must operate separately from political campaigns but can raise unlimited sums. The Trump campaign has committed to spending $32.4 million during the same period, with the Trump Super PAC known as Great America PAC saying it would also contribute another $2.35 million in broadcast and cable ads. The newest batch of campaign finance filings also reveal that the celebrity businessmans recent vow that he would contribute in excess of $100 million to his campaign out of his own fortune has also fallen short.    Trump contributed $56 million through the end of September, chipping in an additional $31,000 since then.  Spending on television commercials doesnotdecide an election. Trump, with hiscontroversialstatements and inflammatory tweets, has mastered the art of garnering free media coverage, which is expected to top $5 billion by Election  Day, more than double the amount Clinton is likely to earn, according to data analytics tracker mediaQuant. Butever since Trumps campaign began to falter last summer after he criticized the family of a slain U.S. soldier, Clinton has been able to use her ad spending juggernaut to repetitively pound at criticisms of Trump, which several strategists said had exacerbated his slide in polls, where he now lags Clinton by eight percentage points. Trump could pour more money into his ad operation in the final 11 days of the campaign. Republican presidential campaign operatives said areas where Trump could still spend included battleground states, national ad buys and digital outreach and phone banking.   But they also said it may be too late for such outlays to make a difference.  The stations would gladly take his money, said Fred Davis, amajor Republican ad maker. I just dont think he will. During the Republican nominating contests, Trump vanquished 16 opponents in part by eschewing campaign finance mainstays such as ads and pollsters.    He felt he won the primary with basically no ad spending by being a larger-than-life TV personality. It worked,Davis said. But the general election, he added, was a whole new ballgame. Many of Clintons TV ads have focused on upbeat messages featuring her work on behalf of women and children. Shes also spent a large amount of her advertising budget attacking Trump, including a commercial that showed children listening to some of his most demeaning remarks about women.  Trumps ads, by contrast, paint a dark picture of America, besieged by violence and on the brink of economic destruction.   Rick Wilson, a former strategist for Republican Mitt Romneys 2012 campaign, said ads dont matter, until they do, adding that comments by Trump that critics have called racist and sexist were providing maximum ammunition for Clinton. Trump may not be able to rely on his small cadre of big donors, either: Make America Number 1 PAC  a super PAC formed by conservative mega-donor Robert Mercer - raised nothing between Oct. 1 and 19.  At the same time, Trump has also stopped doing high-dollar fundraisers. Overall, the reports released on Thursday night showed how much Trump and his lean campaign operation have been dwarfed by Clintons big money juggernaut. In total, Trump has raised $292 million between his campaign and affiliated Super PACs, including his own contributions, whereas Clinton has hauled in more than twice that, at $718 million.

"Plane carrying VP candidate Pence skids off NY runway, no injuries","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A plane carrying U.S. Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence skidded off the runway after landing in the rain at New York Citys LaGuardia Airport on Thursday, halting flights for at least an hour, officials said. No one was injured in the incident which occurred less than two weeks before the U.S. presidential election, crucial campaign days for Pence and running mate Donald Trump. Pence pledged to hit the campaign trail again on Friday. So thankful everyone on our plane is safe, the Indiana governor said on Twitter after the incident. Grateful for our first responders & the concern & prayers of so many. The Boeing 737 was coming in for a landing and went off the runway at about 7:40 p.m. local time (2340 GMT). The plane was stopped by a crushable type of concrete runway that arrested the aircrafts movement, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jim Peters said. The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board said they will investigate the cause of the incident. Trump called his running mate before a rally in Geneva, Ohio. I just spoke to Mike Pence and hes fine, Trump told the crowd at the rally. The plane skidded off the runway and was pretty close to grave, grave danger.  Trump and Pence have slipped in the polls in recent weeks, in part due to negative public reaction to the release of a decade-old video in which Trump made lewd comments about women and said he could grab them by their genitals because he was a celebrity. Since then, numerous women have come forward to say that they were groped by Trump, claims that he has denied.  On Thursday, Pence had been scheduled to attend a fundraiser at Trump Tower in Manhattan, but was not able to make the event after his plane slid off the runway, a campaign aide said. Pence will resume his normal schedule Friday using a different plane, the aide said. Live television footage showed Pence standing in the rain near the plane among emergency vehicles, talking to police and other officials. Trumps opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, on Twitter said she was glad Pence and the rest of the passengers and crew were safe.  There were about 30 people onboard the plane, including Pences wife, Karen, and daughter Charlotte, MSNBC said. The plane was coming from Fort Dodge, Iowa, where Pence had participated in a campaign event.  The takeoff from Iowa was delayed for about two hours because of bad weather in New York. Pence had earlier posted on Twitter a picture of himself playing football in the bright sun on grass near his plane in Iowa, citing the delay in leaving for New York.     In 2015 a Delta Air Lines Inc jet landing during a snowstorm at LaGuardia Airport slid off the runway and struck a fence before coming to rest on a snow-covered embankment just feet from the frigid waters of Flushing Bay.

The (FBI) Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining, campaign chairman John Podesta said in a statement after the FBI said it was examining new emails for whether they contained classified information.

Schultz said news of the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe has not affected Obamas support for Clinton.

U.S. Supreme Court takes up major transgender rights case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed for the first time to rule on transgender rights in a case in which a Virginia public school district is fighting to prevent a female-born transgender high school student from using the boys bathroom. The justices agreed to hear the Gloucester County School Boards appeal of a lower courts April 19 ruling that transgender students are protected under U.S. laws barring sex-based discrimination. The case involves a 17-year-old transgender student named Gavin Grimm, who identifies as male and sued in 2015 to win the right to use the schools boys bathroom. The case, to be argued and decided before the end of June, will be one of the biggest of the courts term. I never thought that my restroom use would ever turn into any kind of national debate. The only thing I ever asked for was the right to be treated like everyone else, Grimm said in a statement. The courts decision to take the case means Grimm will not be able to use the boys bathroom before graduating from high school next year, said Josh Block, his lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union. These sorts of discriminatory policies stigmatize and isolate transgender students like Gavin just because of who they are, Block added. The school boards chairman, Troy Anderson, welcomed the courts decision to hear the case, saying the boards policy carefully balances the interests of all students and parents.  Conservative groups have backed the school board, saying the fight is about student privacy rights. In light of the right to bodily privacy, federal law should not be twisted to require that a male be given access to the girls facilities, or a female to the boys facilities, said Gary McCaleb, a lawyer with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group. At the heart of the case is the question of whether transgender people are covered by a ban on gender discrimination in education under federal law. President Barack Obamas administration concluded that they are, but there is a legal fight over whether judges are required to defer to the governments view. The justices could side-step a major ruling by focusing their decision on whether the administration followed the correct procedure when it gave public notice about that legal conclusion. The court remains one justice short following the February death of Antonin Scalia, which left it with four conservatives and four liberals. That raises the possibility of a 4-4 ruling that would leave in place the decision favoring Grimm by the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A 4-4 ruling would set no nationwide legal precedent. The court until now had generally steered clear of taking  potentially divisive cases while it remained shorthanded. The Supreme Court has not directly ruled on transgender rights before. But in 1994 the court did rule in favor of a male-born transgender prison inmate identifying as a woman who was held with male prisoners and said she was beaten and raped by another inmate. Whether to allow transgender people to use public bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity rather than their birth gender has become the latest flashpoint in the long U.S. battle over lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. In a major gay rights ruling in 2015, the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The transgender fight heated up after North Carolina passed a Republican-backed law in March that required people to use bathrooms that corresponded to their gender at birth in government buildings and public schools. The North Carolina law, being challenged in court, also blocked local measures protecting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people from discrimination.  The Obama administration in May issued nationwide guidance telling public schools that transgender students should be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice. That guidance infuriated many conservatives and prompted a Republican-led legal effort to fight it. Twenty-three states sued to block the guidance. A U.S. district court judge on Aug. 22 issued a nationwide injunction sought by Texas and other states preventing the administration from enforcing the guidance. In the Virginia case, the Supreme Court in July voted 5-3 to temporarily block the appeals court decision from going into effect while the litigation continued, a move that prevented Grimm from using the boys bathroom when the new school year began in September. Grimm began attending school as a boy in September 2014. With the schools permission, Grimm used the boys bathroom for about seven weeks without incident. But after complaints from parents, the county school board adopted a new policy in December2014 that required students to use the bathroom that corresponded with their gender at birth. Since then, Grimm has had to use a separate bathroom.  As a result of hormone therapy, Grimm has facial hair and a deep voice. Grimm has also had chest reconstruction surgery but not sex reassignment surgery. ",politicsNews,"October 28, 2016 ",1

Factbox: Women who have alleged inappropriate conduct by Trump,"(Reuters) - At least 12 women have accused U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump of sexual advances and groping. Among his accusers are a Miss Utah beauty pageant winner, a businesswoman, a reporter and a receptionist. He has denied the accusations. In a 2005 video that emerged on Oct. 7, Trump boasted about grabbing women by the genitals and kissing them without their consent. In a U.S. presidential debate on Oct. 9, he said he was embarrassed by what he called locker-room talk but had not engaged in the conduct he described in the video.  Trump has called absolutely false the allegations by several women of groping and other misconduct, reported by The New York Times and other news media. At a rally this month, after two more women made accusations of groping, he denounced all the recent allegations by a series of women, calling them fabrications and calling the women sick.  Following are some of the allegations against Trump:  Jessica Leeds, 74, recounted in a video interview posted on The New York Times website on Oct. 12 that Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt on a flight to New York in or around 1980 when she was a 38-year-old traveling businesswoman. In a tweet and in a later speech on Oct. 13, Trump called the Times story a total fabrication. Kristin Anderson, in a video posted on the website of The Washington Post on Oct. 14, said Trump put his hand up her skirt in a crowded New York nightclub in the early 1990s in an unwanted advance, when she had never even met him. He did touch my vagina through my underwear, absolutely, Anderson said in the video interview. Jill Harth, a former Trump beauty pageant business associate, filed a $125 million lawsuit in 1997 against Trump alleging that on Jan. 24, 1993, at Trumps Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, Trump forcibly removed plaintiff to a bedroom, whereupon defendant subjected plaintiff to defendants unwanted sexual advances. A Trump spokesperson was quoted on Oct. 7 in The New York Times as saying, Mr. Trump denies each and every statement made by Ms. Harth. The lawsuit was dropped in May 1997. Temple Taggart, a former Miss Utah, said that Trump twice kissed her on the lips in greeting while she was a contestant for the Miss USA pageant in 1997, when she was 21 years old. What he did made me feel so uncomfortable that I ended up cutting my trip short, bought my own plane ticket, flew home and never spoke to him again, Taggart said at an Oct. 28 press conference in Salt Lake City with her attorney, Gloria Allred. Cathy Heller said that Trump in 1997 tried to kiss her during a Mothers Day brunch at Mar-A-Lago. Heller, her husband, her three children and her in-laws attended the event. When she was introduced to Trump, He took my hand, and grabbed me, and went for the lips, she told The Guardian newspaper. She said she leaned backward to avoid him and almost lost her balance. And he said, Oh, come on. He was strong. And he grabbed me and went for my mouth and went for my lips. She said she turned her head and Trump kissed her on the side of the mouth. Yoga instructor Karena Virginia, at a news conference in New York City in October, said Trump approached her outside the U.S. Open tennis tournament in 1998. They had never met, and she was 27 years old, she said. She alleged that Trump commented on her legs and then touched her breast before she was able to get into a car and be driven away. Trump campaign spokeswoman Jessica Ditto said the accusation was a publicity-seeking attack coordinated with Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, and added: Voters are tired of these circus-like antics and reject these fictional stories. Mindy McGillivray was cited in an article published in The Palm Beach Post on Oct. 12 that while she was a 23-year-old   photographers assistant at a Jan. 24, 2003, event at Mar-a-Lago, Trump had grabbed her buttocks. The Palm Beach Post cited a Trump spokesperson as saying, This allegation lacks any merit or veracity. Rachel Crooks, formerly a receptionist at a real estate firm, told The New York Times in a report published on Oct. 12   that Trump kissed me directly on the mouth in 2005 at Trump Tower in Manhattan when she was 22. In a tweet and in a later speech on Oct. 13, Trump called the Times story a total fabrication. Natasha Stoynoff, a reporter, wrote a first-person account that described Trump kissing her without her consent in December 2005 at Mar-a-Lago while she was working on an article about him and his third wife, Melania, for People magazine. In the account published by People on Oct. 12, Stoynoff said he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat. In a tweet and in a later speech on Oct. 13, Trump said the episode described did not happen. Summer Zervos, who was a contestant on Trumps reality show The Apprentice in 2006, said at a news conference on Oct. 14 in Las Vegas that Trump tried to get her to lie down on a bed with him when she met him in 2007 to discuss a possible job. Zervos said she complied with a request to sit next to Trump, and, He then grabbed my shoulder and began kissing me very aggressively and placed his hand on my breast. Trump at a rally in North Carolina denounced the allegations made by a series of women in recent days, calling them fabrications. Ninni Laaksonen, a former Miss Finland, accused Trump of groping her in 2006 when she was representing her country in the Miss Universe beauty contest. Laaksonen told the Ilta-Sanomat newspaper that he had grabbed her behind before she appeared on a television show in New York with other contestants. He really grabbed my butt. I dont think anybody saw it but I flinched and thought: What is happening?, she was quoted as saying in the newspaper.  Jessica Drake, an adult film actor, accused Trump of pressuring her to have sex with him 10 years ago when they met at a golf tournament. After, she said, a man, possibly Trump, called to offer her $10,000 if she would have sex with him, which she declined. Trumps campaign said the accusations were false.

Clinton email problem resurfaces as FBI announces review,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The FBI is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Hillary Clintons use of a private email system, it said on Friday, in a new twist that could damage the Democratic candidate in the 2016 presidential race. Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said in a letter to senior lawmakers that the agency would determine whether the additional emails contained classified information, adding that he did not know how long it will take us to complete this additional work. The announcement came as Clinton and Republican opponent Donald Trump enter the final stretch of campaigning ahead of the Nov. 8 election.  In a news conference late on Friday in Des Moines, Iowa, Clinton urged Comey to release more details about what the FBI was looking for in the newly discovered emails. She leads Trump in opinion polls after a bruising campaign in which she has struggled to convince voters that she is trustworthy and honest. Fresh revelations about her use of email are unlikely to assuage those concerns, and questions around the FBI investigation will now likely dog her in the coming days as she campaigns across battleground states. U.S. stocks immediately fell sharply on the news, but went on to partially recover. The FBI spent about a year investigating Clintons use of the unauthorized server at her home in Chappaqua, New York, while she was U.S. secretary of state after classified government secrets were found in some of her emails.  Comey said in July that while there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. Although Comey recommended no criminal charges be brought against Clinton, Trump has repeatedly said her email practices are criminal and should disqualify her for office. He seized on Fridays development at rallies in Maine and New Hampshire. This is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and Im sure it will be properly handled from this point forward, Trump told a crowd in Lisbon, Maine. We hope that all, all justice will be fully served, he said. Supporters cheered his words and chanted, Lock her up. Clinton said she had learned of the newly discovered emails from news reports.  Im confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July, she said. Thats why its incumbent upon the FBI to tell us whats going on. Two sources close to the investigation said the latest emails were discovered not during an investigation into Clinton, but rather as part of a separate probe into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The FBI has been investigating illicit text messages allegedly sent from Weiner to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and found the Clinton emails on a device related to that investigation, the sources said. Abedin told federal investigators in April that she used several email accounts for her work, including a Yahoo email, according to a summary of the interview released by the FBI in September. She said it was difficult to print from the State Departments email system so she routinely forwarded documents to her private accounts when she needed to print them out, according to the summary.  Abedin announced her separation from Weiner in August after a sex scandal similar to an earlier incident that led him to resign from the U.S. Congress. Lawyers representing Abedin did not respond to questions sent by email on Friday. Weiner did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment, and he did not respond to phone calls. Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic strategist who had previously advised former President Bill Clinton but has no role with Hillary Clintons campaign, said the linking of Clintons email woes with Weiners sex scandals made it harder for her campaign to distinguish itself from Trumps sex scandals. The whole campaign is now smeared with sex, corruption and scandal, he said. Nobody remembers the beginning of something, they only remember the end. What are they going to remember? Theyre all the same: sex, scandal, corruption, emails. People are going to have trouble sorting out all this information. Clintons campaign chairman, John Podesta, said it was extraordinary for the FBI to release the letter so close to the end of a hotly contested election. The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining, Podesta said in a statement. We are confident this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in July.  Clinton has repeatedly apologized for using the private email server in her home instead of a government email account for her work as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. She has said she did not knowingly send or receive classified information. While the FBI probe of new emails will likely prove a distraction to Clinton in the coming days, it was unclear what impact it would have when Americans go to the polls. Election experts say about 20 percent of ballots have already been cast, as more Americans vote by mail or go to the polls early. A lot of concern about the emails has already been baked into this electoral cake I think, said Linda Fowler, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. They know she did it, they know it was inappropriate and, failing some sensational revelation on Nov. 6, its hard to see that its going to make that big a difference. Still, Republican lawmakers, who are facing a difficult fight to keep their majorities in both the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives, leaped to condemn Clinton. House Speaker Paul Ryan reiterated his call that the Democratic nominee be barred from briefings involving classified information until the investigation is over. Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, said the FBIs decision to look into the emails shows how serious this discovery must be.    Clinton did not respond to reporters shouted questions about the news when she left her plane for a campaign stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. U.S. stocks declined in a volatile session on Friday but partially recovered from the sharp drop spurred by the FBI announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed the day down about 9 points, or .05 percent, while the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was unchanged on the day. The dollar also fell against major currencies.

U.S. House Speaker Ryan renews call to suspend classified briefings for Clinton,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan on Friday renewed his call for U.S. intelligence officials to stop giving Hillary Clinton classified briefing typically given to presidential candidates in the wake of FBI Director James Comeys letter citing additional emails now under review. This decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators. I renew my call for the Director of National Intelligence to suspend all classified briefings for Secretary Clinton until this matter is fully resolved, Ryan said in a statement referring to the former secretary of state.

"Strong economic report welcome boost for Clinton, Trump calls it 'dismal'","MANCHESTER, N.H. (Reuters) - A stronger-than-expected U.S. economic report on Friday came at a good time for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, although Republican contender Donald Trumps campaign blasted the numbers as dismal. The Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter, its fastest pace in two years and higher than the expected 2.6 percent, thanks to a surge in exports and a rebound in investment.  With just 11 days to go before the Nov. 8 election, the report bolstered Clinton, who has positioned herself as the best candidate to continue years of economic expansion under President Barack Obama. More Americans say jobs and the economy are their No.1 priority when they decide who to vote for than any other issue. Trump argues that as a successful businessman and political outsider, he is the best person to take a new approach to rebuilding an economy that has sent too many jobs overseas and left many Americans struggling to find decent jobs. His campaign said the figures are still not good enough. America can do better than the modest growth of 2.9 percent recorded for the 3rd quarter and the dismal growth of 1.5 percent for the past year, Dan Kowalski, Trumps deputy policy director, said in a statement. Growth hasnt risen above 3 percent for a full year in any year of the Obama presidency, he said. While many voters do not follow economic indicators closely, outside experts said the release was still a good one for Clinton. She is seeking to solidify her lead in opinion polls as the Democratic Party works to win as many seats as possible in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, where Republicans now control majorities. Todays release will likely improve the perception of economic conditions in the U.S. and slightly increase the odds of a Democratic president remaining in the White House, said Brian Schaitkin, senior economist at the Conference Board. Clintons camp said Fridays report showed real progress since Obama took office in 2009, when the country was struggling to emerge from economic recession. With more than 15 million jobs created since early 2010 and real median incomes growing more than 5 percent last year, its clear weve made real progress coming back from the crisis, Clinton senior policy advisor Jacob Leibenluft said in a statement. But he added that there is still more that can be done. Clinton was campaigning on Friday in Iowa, where polls show she and Trump running neck-and-neck, and in Michigan, a traditionally Democratic state hit hard by the movement offshore of many formerly well-paying American manufacturing jobs. Trump was holding rallies in Iowa as well as in another closely contested swing state, New Hampshire, and in Maine, where his campaign sees a chance to grab one of four electoral votes. In the last weeks of the campaign, Clinton has dramatically widened her advantage over Trump in ad spending, amid questions over the celebrity businessmans pledge to contribute more than $100 million of his own money. He spent $56 million through the end of September, and only $31,000 since, according to filings.   Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on Fox News reports that the candidate has stopped putting his own money into his campaign are not true. He has said publicly many times he is in for $100 million and he is happy to invest in his campaign, she said.  ",politicsNews,"October 28, 2016 ",1

New Jersey's 'Bridgegate' defendants executed 'vicious' scheme: prosecutor,"NEWARK, N.J. (Reuters) - Two former allies of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie deliberately closed access lanes to the George Washington Bridge in a vicious and unlawful political revenge scheme, a federal prosecutor said on Friday at the close of their criminal trial. Bridget Kelly, the governors former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, abused their power to create a massive traffic jam in order to punish a local mayor for failing to back Christies re-election campaign, Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee Cortes told jurors in Newark, New Jersey. As cruel and callous as that scheme was, what makes it unlawful was that they misused government resources to carry it out, Cortes said in closing arguments at federal court in Newark, New Jersey. Baronis lawyer is expected to deliver his closing argument later on Friday. The Port Authority operates the George Washington Bridge, said by the agency to be the worlds busiest. Kelly and Baroni are charged with fraud, conspiracy and depriving residents of Fort Lee, New Jersey, of their civil rights. Former Port Authority executive David Wildstein has pleaded guilty and appeared as the governments star witness. Christie has not been charged and has steadfastly denied any advance knowledge of the plan. But Wildstein, Baroni and Kelly all testified that they told the governor some details about the lane closures either beforehand or while they were occurring.  The so-called Bridgegate scandal tarnished Christies national reputation, damaging his unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination. The trial has cast an unflattering light on Christie as a temperamental bully whose administration used the Port Authority to hand out favors, and penalties, to local officials. Kelly and Baroni, both of whom testified in their own defense, said they were duped by Wildstein and his claim that the lane closures were part of a legitimate traffic study. But Cortes warned jurors not to be fooled by that preposterous assertion, pointing to Kellys now-infamous email to Wildstein in which she wrote, Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee, as evidence of her guilt. During his closing argument, Cortes showed jurors numerous messages sent among Kelly, Wildstein and Baroni suggesting they deliberately ignored Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolichs desperate pleas for help as the gridlock became untenable, delaying first responders and stranding school buses for hours. At one point, Wildstein told Baroni that his response to Sokolich should be radio silence. ",politicsNews,"October 28, 2016 ",1
Biden tops Clinton list for U.S. secretary of state: reports,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Vice President Joe Biden tops a short list for secretary of state that is being compiled by the transition team of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, two media outlets reported. Politico on Thursday night cited an unidentified source as saying Clinton and her aides were discussing how to approach Biden about the post, should she win the Nov. 8 presidential election. Most national opinion polls show Clinton, who served as President Barack Obamas first secretary of state, leading Republican Donald Trump in the race for the White House. Biden became a respected voice on foreign policy during his 36 years in the U.S. Senate, where he was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and at one point served alongside Clinton, when she was a senator from New York. Hed be great, and they are spending a lot of time figuring out the best way to try to persuade him to do it if she wins, the source familiar with Clintons transition planning told Politico. NBC News later confirmed that Biden was under consideration for the job of top U.S. diplomat. Biden, of Delaware, had considered running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. He has campaigned vigorously for Clinton in her race against Trump, a New York real estate tycoon and former reality television personality who has never run for office. The vice president said at a campaign event for Clinton in Pennsylvania this week that he is frequently asked whether he wished he had been debating Trump, who has insulted women, Muslims and immigrants and thumbed his nose at political norms. No, I wish we were in high school. I could take him behind the gym. Thats what I wish, Biden said, prompting a similarly pugilistic retort from Trump a couple of days later. In excepts from an interview released from CBS Sunday program Face the Nation, Biden made it clear he wanted to continue his public service. Im not going away. Im, you know, everything from this issue of violence against women, to income inequality, to the cancer moonshot, Im gonna devote the rest of my life to this.  ",politicsNews,"October 28, 2016 ",1

Most Republicans believe Russia is meddling in U.S. election: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Most Republicans believe Russia is attempting to influence the U.S. presidential election, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, despite comments by the partys nominee, Donald Trump, downplaying the possibility. Some 55 percent of U.S. adults, including 51 percent of Republicans and 65 percent of Democrats, said they thought Russia was trying to tip the scales in the Nov. 8 presidential election, according to the survey.  Most American adults - 62 percent of Democrats and 48 percent of Republicans - think Putin is supporting Trump for the White House, the poll found. Some 71 percent of those who suspect Russia of meddling believe Moscow is doing so through the recent hacks of Democratic emails, according to the Oct. 18-24 survey. But 57 percent of those who suspect Russian interference also believe Trump has no involvement in Russias release of unflattering information on his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. The U.S. government has accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks targeting the Democratic Party that has led to the release of thousands of illegally obtained emails, revealing the sometimes unflattering inner workings of the party, Clintons campaign, and her familys charitable foundation.  Clinton has said she believes the Kremlin is trying to help Trump, calling her rival a puppet of the Russian leader. Trump has declined to implicate the country in any wrongdoing. I dont think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the (Democratic National Committee), Trump said during the first presidential debate last month. He suggested the culprit could be anyone from Russia, to China or even a 400-pound person lying in bed. Russia has denied it sponsors or encourages hacking activity. Russian President Vladimir Putin accused U.S. politicians on Thursday of whipping up hysteria about a nonexistent threat in order to distract voters. Putin, who has described Trump as very talented, said on Thursday the New York businessman behaves extravagantly to get through to voters hearts.  Trump has said he is not close with Putin, but has also said he believes the Russian president is a stronger leader than U.S. President Barack Obama. Already chilly relations between the United States and Russia have deteriorated over disagreements over the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria.  U.S. officials say U.S. agencies have concluded that two Russian intelligence agencies - the militarys GRU and the civilian foreign intelligence agency, the FSB - are behind U.S. political hacking, particularly that directed against Democratic Party organizations and individuals. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English, and included 2,008 American adults. It had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.

"Clinton holds lead, but pollsters say their job is harder","BOSTON (Reuters) - Many opinion polls show Democrat Hillary Clinton leading Republican Donald Trump in a tight race for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, but any one of four factors may make the outcome harder to predict. Among the challenges for pollsters: The historic unpopularity of both candidates, the potential Election Day voter response to the polls themselves, the growing abandonment of landlines for cellphones, and the rise of online polling. Some high-profile stumbles worldwide - including opinion polls that missed Colombias Oct. 2 rejection of a peace deal - underscore how technological, social and cultural shifts have made polling more difficult than ever. An average of polls compiled by RealClearPolitics.com shows former Secretary of State Clinton beating Trump, a businessman, by 5.4 percentage points. Highlighting the difficulties, the range varies from plus-13 for Clinton to a straight tie. Trump has said the election is rigged against him and this week, in a Reuters interview, he accused media organizations of tilting the polls deliberately, but he has yet to offer any widely accepted evidence to back up these claims. Voter turnout in the last few presidential elections has been about 60 percent. But given both candidates low overall popularity, turnout this year may fall to as low as 52 percent, said Cliff Zukin, a professor emeritus of political science at New Jerseys Rutgers University and a former president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research.  That makes it hard to guess who might stay home. Its always been difficult to simulate a likely electorate and I think thats harder to do in 2016, Zukin said. A second pitfall is the effect of the polling itself on voters. Sociologists believe polls can weaken projected winners by making their supporters more confident of the outcome and, therefore, less likely to vote.  The percentage of Trump supporters who expect him to win has dropped to 49 percent in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from Oct. 20-24, down from 74 percent from Sept. 16-20. Clinton supporters confidence rose at the same time. If that leads to a higher turnout of Trump supporters than of Clinton supporters, it might affect the election outcome. Pollsters caution, however, that the effect of polls on the electorate can only go so far.  If it were showing Clinton up by 2 points, then its certainly possible that it would be within the margin of error that Trump might win, said Douglas Schwartz, director of the Quinnipiac University Poll. But if youre finding that all of these high-quality polls are showing Clinton consistently ahead, then I think you can trust them, he said. One of the biggest factors in polling today is the prevalence of cellphones. About half of Americans have only a cellphone and no landline, according to Federal Communications Commission data, more than double the number who were wireless-only in 2010.  This makes it harder and more expensive for pollsters to gather a truly random sample of opinions because U.S. law prohibits computerized auto-dialing (also known as robocalls) to cellphones and there is no central directory for cellphones.  Polling cellphones can costs 30 to 50 percent more than polling land lines due to requirements that the numbers be dialed manually, according to Pew Research Center estimates. This has led polling outfits to generally rely on lower sample sizes to come up with results. Calls to cellphones are also more easily screened by their users, and as a result pollsters say they connect with just 10 percent of people they try to contact, down from 80 percent a few decades ago.  But Courtney Kennedy, director of survey research at Pew said, In terms of data, the quality is better. Many respondents on cellphones are young and racially diverse, she said. Others, such as Reuters/Ipsos, conduct surveys online. This allows them to reach large numbers of people at lower cost. But because participants are volunteers in many cases, rather than selected at random, segments of the electorate may be left out.  The lower or skewed response in both cellphone and online polls can pose a challenge with pollsters having to adjust results to match the real world. To accomplish this, they weight more heavily the opinions of types of voters under-represented in their surveys. Pollsters use population statistics, experience and intuition to do this. For instance, if the proportion of men who respond to a survey is lower than their proportion of the overall population, the pollster will adjust the finding to try to even that out. Then youve built in an assumption that the males that didnt respond are like the males that responded. And thats an unknowable fact, said Robert Groves, provost of Georgetown University, a social statistician and author of seven books on polling who served as director of the U.S. Census Bureau from 2009 through 2012. But such modeling can work well in some cases. A study by Columbia University statisticians, published in 2014 in the International Journal of Forecasting, showed that a poll of users of Microsoft Corps Xbox gaming system could be used to accurately predict the elections outcome. The gamers were far younger, whiter and more male than the U.S. electorate and predicted a sweeping victory for Republican Mitt Romney in 2012. But when the results were weighted according to voters who turned out in 2008, they predicted President Barack Obamas 2012 re-election. Getting the weightings right this time could be a tougher job because Trump has attracted many supporters who historically have voted erratically, or not at all. We cant apply 2008 and 2012 models to 2016, said Ashley Koning, director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University.    ",politicsNews,"October 28, 2016 ",1
"Trump attacks Clinton on trade, says he should be handed victory","TOLEDO, Ohio; WINSTON SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump criticized Democrat Hillary Clinton on Thursday over her trade policies, saying she would handle trade deals so badly that the country should just cancel the election and name him the victor.  Speaking to supporters in Toledo, Ohio, Trump said the North American Free Trade Agreement signed by Clintons husband, former President Bill Clinton, had led to the outsourcing of thousands of Ohio jobs to Mexico, a practice he vowed to stop if elected president on Nov. 8. We should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump, right? he said. What are we even having it for? Her policies are so bad. Trump said he believed Clinton would seek passage of the 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership, President Barack Obamas signature Asian trade deal, which she now opposes. Trumps remarks came as the New York businessman tries to steady rocky poll numbers amid a series of controversies and self-inflicted wounds.  He has struggled to handle the fallout from the release of a 2005 Access Hollywood video that showed the then-reality TV star talking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. The video was taped only months after Trump married his third wife, Melania. Trump said on Thursday it was certainly illegal for NBC to release the tape and he left open the option of seeking legal action against the network after the election. Since the videos release, a series of women have accused Trump of groping them or kissing them without their consent. Trump has called the allegations absolutely false. The latest RealClearPolitics poll average showed Clinton with a nearly 6-point national lead over Trump, fueled by declining support among women for his candidacy. Trump, without evidence, has blamed his sagging poll numbers on a rigged election, and said the media had fixed the opinion polls in order to inflate Clintons numbers. Numerous studies have shown that voter fraud in U.S. elections is very rare, and a number of prominent Republicans have denounced Trumps claim that the system is unsound. While Trump campaigned in  Ohio, a plane carrying his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, skidded off the runway after landing at New York Citys LaGuardia Airport on Thursday night. There were no injuries, the Pence campaign said. Clinton on Thursday made her first joint campaign appearance with one of her most powerful supporters, first lady Michelle Obama, at a North Carolina rally to urge young people and women to vote. Clinton, a former first lady who lost the 2008 Democratic nomination to then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama before becoming his secretary of state, praised Michelle Obama for standing up for the rights of girls and women worldwide, drawing a sharp contrast with her Republican rival. I wish I didnt have to say this. ... But indeed, dignity and respect for women and girls is also on the ballot in this election, Clinton told a crowd of about 11,000. And I want to thank our first lady for her eloquent, powerful defense of that basic value. Michelle Obamas stinging denunciation of Trump after a leaked 2005 video showed him making lewd remarks and bragging about groping women was seen by many as one of the campaigns most striking condemnations of the New York businessman. Without naming Trump, Obama took him to task again in North Carolina, asking the crowd which candidate they wanted to represent their daughters from the White House. We want a president who takes this job seriously, and has the temperament and maturity to do it well. Someone who is steady. Someone who we can trust with the nuclear codes, Obama said.  I would not be here lying to you: I believe with all of my heart that Hillary Clinton will be that president, she said. Although Michelle Obama was critical of Clinton during the hard-fought 2008 Democratic nominating race, any trace of bitterness appeared long behind them. The two women showed an easy rapport. They embraced and smiled. Obama called Clinton my girl and made a point of telling the crowd they were tight. If people wonder: Yes, Hillary Clinton is my friend, she said. Clinton promised to take good care of Obamas White House vegetable garden if she won and wistfully praised the athletic first ladys dancing skills. One could only hope, Clinton said. She also lauded Obamas work for children and military families and in what was perhaps a nod to African-Americans she hopes will vote for her in the state, said Obama had faced challenges she had not as a presidential spouse. Lets be real. As our first African-American first lady, shes faced pressures I never did, and shes handled them with pure grace, Clinton said to applause. Although a sometimes reluctant campaigner, the first lady has thrown herself into the race, and the Clinton campaign has deployed her strategically to increase support among young people and blacks, with whom she is especially popular.

Brazil prosecutor says Trump franchise may have benefited from corruption,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - A Brazilian prosecutor investigating potentially corrupt investments made by state pension funds said the real estate company run by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump appears to have benefited suspiciously from a massive redevelopment of Rio de Janeiros port ahead of the Olympics. The development, known as Porto Maravilha, or Marvelous Port in Portuguese, cost 8 billion reais ($2.5 billion) and developed run-down docklands into a plaza, museums, corporate and residential real estate. As part of the project, five 38-story buildings were meant to be erected under the Trump brand.  Public prosecutor Alselmo Lopes said in a court filing made public on Thursday that he is investigating the Porto Maravilha deal, in which the national employee severance fund FGTS, managed by state-bank Caixa Economica Federal [CEF.UL], paid up-front for building rights which it then sold on.      The structuring of the Porto Maravilha deal favored, in a suspicious way, the Trump Organization economic group, among others, Lopes said. The prosecutor gave no further details and was not immediately reachable for comment.  His spokeswoman, Dionne Tiago, said Lopes would not explain the basis for his suspicions until next week.  None of the five people Lopes sought to charge in the court filing for siphoning off 8 billion reais from the Caixas pension fund were related to the Trump Organization.   The Trump Organization, which sold naming rights for the Rio towers but did not provide any funding for the project, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  A senior executive involved in the Trump Towers Rio dismissed the prosecutors charge as baseless. Any allegations that the Porto Maravilha Investment Fund of Caixa Econmica Federal has favored in a suspicious waythe Trump Organization economic groupare completely unfounded, the executive, who asked not to be named, said by email.  Not long after plans for the towers were first announced, Donald Trump tweeted in January 2013: The Trump Organization is going revolutionize Rio de Janeiros downtown port area with Trump Towers. Construction begins soon!  Two of the five Trump Towers were supposed to be ready by the Olympics, but ground has yet to be broken. Developers say the project is still going ahead and has not been scrapped. Trump Towers Rio on its website claims it is the first project in Brazil to bear the name of the U.S. real estate magnate and the largest urban office development in the BRICS group of leading emerging market countries.

Donald Trump throws counter punch after Joe Biden comments,"GENEVA, Ohio (Reuters) - Donald Trump shrugged off tough talk from Vice President Joe Biden with a verbal counter punch of his own. At a rally in Geneva, Ohio, the Republican presidential nominee on Thursday night addressed Bidens remark last week that he would like to take Trump behind the gym to punish him for videotaped remarks in 2005 in which Trump boasted about groping women. You know what you do with Biden? You go like this, Trump said, then turned to the side to blow out a puff of air from his mouth. And hed fall over. Trump is 70 years old. Biden is 73. Both have been known to delve into hyperbole. Biden had said at a campaign event for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania that he is frequently asked whether he wished he had been debating Trump. Biden had flirted with running for president this year. No, I wish we were in high school. I could take him behind the gym. Thats what I wish, Biden said. Trump said if he had ever made a statement like that about Biden the news media would be outraged. Can you imagine if I ever made that statement? Donald trump is a bully! He threatened Vice President Biden! But everybody said oh, that was a wonderful statement, Trump said. I dream about Biden, Trump added. Boy, that would be easy. That would be an easy one.

'Nasty woman' and Ken Bone: election's viral stars a hit for Halloween,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - With the U.S. election just days away, Americans can expect to see an occasional nasty woman and basket of deplorables knocking on doors this Halloween alongside the usual parade of goblins, ghosts and ghouls. Revelers are planning costumes inspired by the campaign for the Nov. 8 election, seeking catharsis and humor at the end of the often bitterly fought White House race between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. Ted Wright, a marketing executive from Atlanta, said he and his wife were planning to dress as a bad hombre and nasty woman, respectively, references to Trumps much-ridiculed remarks about some Mexican immigrants and Clinton during a presidential debate on Oct. 19. This is one of those elections where its very difficult to discuss [it] in polite company, said Wright, 49, a Republican who said he would not vote for Trump. That is why were going bad hombre and were going nasty woman. Hannah Hemperly, a 22-year-old recent college graduate, said she planned to dress up as a nasty woman as well. When (Trump) was calling (Clinton) a nasty woman, I think I just felt solidarity with Hillary, said Hemperly, who lives in Chicago and planned to vote for the Democratic nominee.  Jake West, who works at a Chicago-area architecture firm, said he was going to assemble a group of friends to dress as a basket of deplorables, a reference to Clintons infamous put-down during a fundraiser of some Trump supporters. West, 43, latched onto the idea because that word, that phrase, basket of deplorables has been flying around so much. More traditional election-related costumes were also popular ahead of the fancy dress parties and parades planned for the days around Halloween, Oct. 31. Foam Clinton and Trump masks priced at $12.99 were among the top-sellers at Spirit Halloween, according to a spokeswoman for the chain, which specializes in costumes and party supplies. By Wednesday, the Clinton mask had sold out online. Corey Campbell of Virginia said he would shave his beard to mark a briefly famous moment in the campaign. Campbell planned to dress as Ken Bone, the mustachioed, red sweater-wearing audience member who became a social media sensation after he cut into the campaign acrimony to ask an earnest question about energy policy during a town hall presidential debate on Oct. 9. Campbell, who said he was leaning toward voting for Trump, called Bone a bright moment in this crazy campaign cycle. I think the only way you could not have a little campaign fatigue after this cycle is if you havent been paying attention. ",politicsNews,"October 27, 2016 ",1
Obama rallies Obamacare troops at 'critical time' for program,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Thursday urged more than 25,000 volunteers and advocates who dialed in to a White House conference call to pull out the stops to boost the number of people signing up for Obamacare health insurance plans. Obama warned it will be challenging to overcome the skepticism about the plans given an onslaught of headlines about surging premium prices, but he said the stakes are high. I think were at a critical time where we have to show that this program works for people, if they just see what their options are, he told the volunteers, who work in their communities to encourage and assist enrollment. Americans who do not receive health insurance through their employer or through Medicare or Medicaid programs shop online for subsidized insurance plans starting Nov. 1 until the end of January. The average premium for benchmark 2017 plans sold on healthcare.gov rose 25 percent compared with 2016. Obama said tax credits will help more than seven in 10 shoppers get a plan for less than $75 per month, but said many may not bother looking because they have heard about spiking costs. Were going to have to clear the bugs off the windshield so people can see the road ahead, and thats where you guys come in, Obama said. The law has been fought by Republicans in Congress, who said it creates unwarranted government intervention in personal healthcare and private industry. Several big insurers, including UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), Aetna Inc (AET.N) and Humana Inc (HUM.N), are pulling out of the online marketplaces selling the subsidized plans, citing bigger-than-expected financial losses. Aetna Chief Executive Mark Bertolini said on Thursday that the earliest his company may return to the marketplaces would be 2019. Obama said more young and healthy people need to sign up for plans. That would offset insurers costs of covering members with serious illnesses. Obama has said there are a series of improvements that could be made to his signature domestic policy achievement - the 2010 Affordable Care Act - if Congress and the next president, who will take office on Jan. 20, can work together. Part of what we can do this time is to overcome the skeptics, to prove people wrong, and to provide momentum so that when the next administration comes in, they are starting from a position of strength, Obama told the conference call.

Obama shortens prison sentences for 98 convicts: White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama shortened the prison sentences for 98 convicts serving time for drug-related offenses in his latest round of commutations, including for 42 people serving life sentences, the White House said on Thursday. Obama has granted 688 commutations this year, for a total so far of 872 during his presidency, which ends on Jan. 20. These are individuals - many of whom made mistakes at a young age - who have diligently worked to rehabilitate themselves while incarcerated, White House Counsel Neil Eggleston said in a statement. The commutations are part of Obamas push to reform the criminal justice system to reduce the number of people serving long sentences for non-violent drug offenses. Obama and a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the U.S. Congress had tried to work on legislation to reduce mandatory minimum sentences, but those efforts stalled ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election.

U.S. lawmakers raise privacy concerns over new hacking rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the U.S. Congress on Thursday asked the Justice Department to clarify how a looming rule change to the governments hacking powers could impact privacy rights of innocent Americans. The change, due to take place on December 1, would let judges issue search warrants for remote access to computers located in any jurisdiction, potentially including foreign countries. Magistrate judges can normally only order searches within the jurisdiction of their court, which is typically limited to a few counties. We are concerned about the full scope of the new authority that would be provided to the Department of Justice, 23 senators and representatives wrote to Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The Supreme Court in April approved amendments to Rule 41 of the federal rules of criminal procedure that would allow judges to issue warrants in cases when a suspect uses anonymizing technology to conceal the location of his or her computer or for an investigation into a network of hacked or infected computers, such as a botnet.  Those amendments will take effect on December 1 of this year unless Congress passes legislation that would reject, amend or postpone the changes. Some lawmakers, led by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, have introduced legislation that would halt the changes, but it has yet to gain much traction. In their letter, the lawmakers asked how the government would prevent under the expanded rule so-called forum shopping, where prosecutors seek warrants in districts considered more favorable to law enforcement.  They also asked how the Justice Department intends to notify users when electronic devices have been searched and whether law enforcement has the authority to disable malicious software on a protected device, including those belonging to innocent Americans, among other questions.  The Justice Department has worked on Rule 41 changes for years, arguing they are procedural in nature and necessary to keep pace with criminal threats posed by evolving technology. Civil liberties groups and some technology companies, including Alphabet Incs Google, have said the changes could allow for searches that run afoul of privacy rights. The Justice Department is reviewing the lawmakers letter, which asked for a response within two weeks, spokesman Peter Carr said. ",politicsNews,"October 27, 2016 ",1
Putin says U.S. 'hysteria' over Russia is election ploy,"KRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin on Thursday accused American politicians of whipping up hysteria about a mythical Russian threat as a ploy to distract voters from their own failings in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election. Putin, addressing an audience of foreign policy experts gathered in southern Russia, repeatedly lashed out at the Obama administration, saying it did not keep its word on Syria, did not honour deals, and had falsely accused Moscow of all manner of sins.     The U.S. government has formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organisations, while Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has accused Republican rival Donald Trump of being a Putin puppet. Putin said he found it hard to believe that anyone seriously thought Moscow was capable of influencing the Nov. 8 election. Hysteria has been whipped up, said Putin.  He said that was a ruse to cover up for the fact that the U.S. political elite had nothing to say about serious issues such as the countrys national debt or gun control. Its much simpler to distract people with so-called Russian hackers, spies, and agents of influence. Does anyone really think that Russia could influence the American peoples choice in any way? Is America a banana republic or what? America is a great power. In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest dismissed Putins remarks as predictable and said the United States stood by its hacking allegations.  Theres nothing that President Putin had to say today that I find particularly surprising or that in any way undermines the presidents confidence in the analysis thats been released by the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence community, said Earnest. Russian state TV and some of his past comments have suggested the Russian leader favours Trump, but Putin said he did not back any candidate in the U.S. election and was ready to work with any new U.S. president and to discuss any issue.  Asked about Trump, whom he once described as very talented, Putin said the Republican candidate was deliberately adopting a showy style because he wanted to get his message across and that he represented ordinary voters fed up with the U.S. political elite. He has chosen a method to get through to voters hearts, said Putin. He behaves extravagantly of course, we see this, but I think theres a reason for this. Putin dismissed suggestions by some politicians in the West that Russia is poised to attack another country or intervene elsewhere in the Middle East apart from Syria.    Such talk was designed to exaggerate the threat that Russia posed, he said, in order for certain countries to secure higher military spending and talk up their own importance. He said Russia was not planning to attack anyone. But he made clear Russia was in Syria for the long haul and intended to clear the city of Aleppo of what he called a nest of terrorists, while trying to minimise civilian casualties.

"In breathless U.S. election, Twitter generates buzz not cash","NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - This years presidential election might be the perfect microcosm of Twitters woes.  While some of the most memorable moments of the campaign for the White House have played out on the platform, Twitter has been unable to turn the attention and activity into ad dollars or user growth.  Well suited to quick updates on a noisy and unpredictable campaign, Twitter has been the dominant social media platform in 2016 for candidates, pundits and journalists.  Republican nominee Donald Trumps frequent tweeting of tirades against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, fellow Republicans and the media have been a mainstay of the campaign, setting off furious online debate.  But Twitter Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto acknowledged when the company reported its quarterly earnings Thursday that the election has had no noticeable impact on Twitters user growth, which analysts say is essential for boosting revenue.  Campaigns and political organizations told Reuters that Twitter is simply not a great medium for political advertising. It is not as effective as rival Facebook at targeting crucial independent voters, and high-profile Twitter users like Trump and Clinton can use it as a megaphone without buying any advertising.  We havent really used Twitter, largely because our core mission is to reach those undecided voters, said Alixandria Lapp, executive director of the House Majority PAC, which supports Democratic U.S. House of Representatives candidates.             A flood of hate speech and misinformation, which Twitter has done little to tamp down, can also be a barrier to ad buys, campaign digital strategists said.          Facebook has emerged as the social media ad platform of choice. It reaches about 94 percent of voters who are registered as independent or are not affiliated with a political party; Twitter only reaches 45 percent of these voters, according to data of mobile users by tracking service Comscore Inc.  Vincent Harris, an Austin-based digital strategist who has worked for U.S. Senator Rand Paul and does some work for Trump,     estimated that about 30 percent of his clients budgets are spent on Facebook, while only 5 percent are spent on Twitter.  A recent survey conducted by his company Harris Media found that 81.6 percent of voters said they spent time on Facebook in the last month, while only 28.7 percent spent time on Twitter. MINUTE-TO-MINUTE As Clinton digital strategist Teddy Goff put it, Twitter is the place to be for obsessively tracking the minute-to-minute of this election but Facebook is a much purer platform for message dissemination and talking about the issues voters care about. Doug Watts, the national executive director of the pro-Trump Committee for American Sovereignty Super PAC, said: We use Facebook the most, partially because of the scale, but also when you are talking conservative politics, they have an older audience that fits our target. Twitter, he said, is not really for advertising per se. The Trump campaign has promoted tweets and placed ad content, said Jessica Ditto, a campaign spokeswoman. But she said it is difficult to use Twitter to collect donations and email addresses because promoted content does not typically get a lot of clicks. The perception is a costly one for Twitter. Elections often provide a big financial boost for advertising platforms such as television and radio stations.      In the 2016 contest, CNN has taken in $100 million more than expected due to intense interest in the election, according to David Folkenflik, National Public Radios media reporter. But on Twitters earnings call on Thursday, CFO Noto said:     We really need to have a (presidential) debate on Twitter every day for it to meaningfully improve the quarterly metrics. Some advertisers have tried to take advantage of Twitters central role in the election. Earlier this month, Harris used Twitter to promote a digital campaign that was launched by the conservative anti-immigration group Secure America Now.      More common, though, is the way Clinton operatives use Twitter to engage with what Goff described as a politically attuned audience.     The Clinton campaign collects automated donations via its Troll Trump tool, which asks supporters to pledge a small amount to the campaign every time Trump sends a tweet. The feature is now bringing in $1,588 per tweet, at an average of $11,823 per day, the campaign said.     After Trump called Clinton a nasty woman during a  presidential debate, her female supporters co-opted the term on Twitter, using #NastyWoman to show their support.   Representative Nancy Pelosi, the highest-ranking Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives, tweeted: From one #NastyWoman to another, you were an inspiration last night. Womens health provider Planned Parenthood tweeted this week that Early voting shows a surge of #NastyWomen at the polls  and were just getting started. ",politicsNews,"October 27, 2016 ",1
Hacked emails show Clinton aides surprised at 2015 email revelations,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two aides in charge of running Hillary Clintons presidential campaign were taken aback as news broke in March 2015 of Clintons use of private email for her work as U.S. secretary of state, according to stolen emails published on Thursday by WikiLeaks. The late-night exchange between Robby Mook, Clintons campaign manager, and John Podesta, the campaign chairman, happened within hours of the New York Times breaking the news that Clinton exclusively used a private email account in a way that may have broken records rules. Did you have any idea of the depth of this story? Podesta wrote to Mook at 10:27 p.m. on the night the Times story appeared online, according to an exchange published by WikiLeaks. A few hours later, at 1:32 a.m., Mook wrote back: Nope. We brought up the existence of emails in research this summer but were told that everything was taken care of.  The exchange took place hours before the Associated Press reported for the first time the following morning that Clintons email system was run off a private server Clinton kept in the basement of her home in Chappaqua, New York. The exchange appears to show that even Clintons most senior aides were initially unprepared for the scale of revelations about Clintons email practices, which would end up dogging her campaign all the way through to the final weeks leading up to the Nov. 8 election. Clinton, the Democratic candidate, remains the front-runner in opinion polls over Republican opponent Donald Trump. Many voters have pointed to the unauthorized email system, which stymied attempts by the public to seek Clintons emails through open-records laws, as a reason they find Clinton untrustworthy. Trump has repeatedly attacked her over her emails, saying Clinton should be in prison because she sent and received classified government secrets through the server.  After a yearlong investigation, James Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said in July that Clinton and her staff were extremely careless with classified information, but that no reasonable prosecutor would bring charges. The same night of the Mook-Podesta exchange, Neera Tanden, a longtime Clinton confidante, wrote to Podesta to express her frustration, according to other emails stolen from Podestas account and published in daily batches this month by WikiLeaks, a publishing organization that advocates extreme government transparency. Why didnt they get this stuff out like 18 months ago? Tanden wrote, criticizing Cheryl Mills, a lawyer working for Clinton and Clintons former chief of staff at the State Department. So crazy. Podesta replied with a single word: Unbelievable. I guess I know the answer, Tanden, an outside adviser who does not have a formal role in the campaign, responded. They wanted to get away with it.  Podesta also suggests in the exchange that other Clinton aides withheld information about the emails, although it is unclear if he meant from the public or other colleagues. Speaking of transparency, our friends Kendall, Cheryl and Phillipe sure werent forthcoming on the facts here, Podesta wrote. David Kendall is another lawyer working for Clinton, and Philippe Reines, whose first name Podesta appeared to have misspelled, is a Clinton adviser who handled her news coverage at the State Department. Tanden did not respond to questions. Glen Caplin, a Clinton campaign spokesman, declined to comment on the exchanges, saying the campaign was not confirming the authenticity of the emails. It has not pointed to any instances of doctored messages. He criticized Trump for supporting WikiLeaks, which Caplin said was weaponizing the emails he said were hacked by the Russian government. Every American, regardless of party, should be concerned by this national security issue, he said in a statement. Sergei Lavrov, Russias foreign minister, said this month the accusation his government is behind a spate this year of stolen emails from Democratic Party operatives was flattering but without proof. Nearly five months after the news of Clintons private email first broke, Tanden again wrote to Podesta to link the arrangement to unfavorable public polling that week. Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email? she wrote. And has that person been drawn and quartered? ",politicsNews,"October 27, 2016 ",1
"Winning in court, losing on the ground: uncertainty clouds U.S. voting rights","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. voting rights advocates scored a string of courtroom victories this year that rolled back some of the nations most restrictive voting laws. Now they face another challenge: making sure those rulings are not undermined by officials who oversee elections at the local level. With early voting already under way ahead of the Nov. 8 election, local officials in several states are trying to enforce restrictions that have been suspended or struck down in court, civil rights advocates say. In some cases, the action appears to be the result of bureaucratic confusion. In other cases, they appear to be actively resisting the law. There are still too many places where voting is going to be difficult and confusing, not easy and straightforward, said Leah Aden, senior counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. The foot-dragging by local officials adds another element of uncertainty to what already promises to be a volatile election. The Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that states with a history of racial discrimination dont have to win approval from the U.S. Justice Department when they want to change the way they conduct elections - the first time the Deep South will be free of federal oversight since 1964.  That same ruling has also hobbled the Justice Departments ability to dispatch observers to potentially troublesome spots, raising concerns that it will be harder to deal with any problems that unfairly stop voters from casting their ballots.  Voters in 14 states will also face new voting restrictions, from scaled-back early voting hours to photo-identification requirements, according to New York Universitys Brennan Center for Justice. Roughly 10 percent of eligible voters do not have a government-issued photo ID, including a disproportionate share of minority, poor, student and elderly voters. Republican state legislators who have passed laws paving the way for these changes say they are needed to fight voter fraud. Numerous studies of the issue, however, suggest there is scant evidence of voter fraud in past elections.  One study by Justin Levitt, a Loyola University law professor who now heads the Justice Departments voting rights section, found only 31 cases of voter impersonation out of more than 1 billion votes cast between 2000 and 2014.  Voting rights advocates have managed to roll back some of those restrictions in Texas, North Carolina, North Dakota, Kansas, Ohio and Wisconsin, potentially making it easier for millions of people to vote in states that have the potential to determine the outcome of the election. Not all court challenges have been successful. Civil rights groups in Arizona have failed to defeat a new law that makes it illegal for them to collect absentee ballots by hand, a popular practice in Hispanic and Native American neighborhoods. Republican legislators said the law was needed to combat fraud, though they could cite no examples. Now if I go help a neighbor of mine and I take his ballot for him I can serve a year in prison. Thats really scary, said Antonio Valdovinos, who heads La Machine, a Hispanic activist group. In other states, local officials in some of those states have resisted putting those rulings into effect.  After a federal judge ruled that Texas stringent photo-ID law discriminated against black and Hispanic voters, state officials agreed to allow voters who have trouble getting a drivers license or other approved ID card to provide other forms of identification, such as a utility bill. But in September, the same judge found the state had not properly told voters about the loosened requirements and ordered the state to rewrite voter education materials.  With early voting under way, poll workers in at least seven counties in Texas are still posting misleading signs that tell voters they must provide a photo ID, according to the Texas Civil Rights Project, a coalition of grassroots groups. Officials at the state and the county level say they are in the process of updating posters and educating workers about the new rules, which have been in place since August.  In Wisconsin, clerks in many state offices have refused to issue voting cards to people who dont have the documents necessary to get a photo ID, despite a court order requiring them to do so, activists say. A federal judge found earlier this month that the state had not done enough to tell its employees, as well as voters, about the ruling.  In some cases state officials have only agreed to comply after months of wrangling. In Kansas, Secretary of State Kris Kobach  a leading proponent of stricter voter identification requirements  refused for months to comply with a May court ruling that ordered him to restore the voting rights of 18,000 residents who had been kept off registration lists because they did not provide proof of U.S. citizenship. He gave in last month, when he was threatened with contempt of court.  We think weve won these cases, we get the good legal ruling, but the implementation is where the actual details are, said Dale Ho, head of the American Civil Liberties Unions voting rights project. On top of that, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has encouraged his supporters to patrol voting sites to look for possible signs of fraudulent voting, raising fears that his supporters might try to intimidate black, Hispanic and Muslim voters.  We are on the precipice of the most chaotic election for people of color in 50 years, said Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a coalition of more than 200 national rights groups.

Venezuela crisis enters dangerous phase as Maduro foes go militant,"CARACAS (Reuters) - In a curious convergence of events on the same day last week, four Venezuelan provincial courts issued identical rulings, state governors quickly hit Twitter to celebrate, then the election board emailed a short but bombshell statement. Opposition hopes for a referendum to recall President Nicolas Maduro were dashed, on grounds of fraud in an initial signature drive. The vote was off. For many in the opposition, that settled a years-old debate about the nature of Venezuelas socialist government, uniting them in conviction they are now fighting a dictatorship. Their new militancy heightens the risk of unrest as the South American OPEC member of 30 million people grapples with a dangerous economic and political crisis. Can anyone in the world now really doubt that Venezuela is living in tyranny? said housewife Mabel Pinate, 62, dressed in white among thousands of protesters who took to the streets against Maduro on Wednesday. We are sick of this. Its time to toughen up and do what we must to save Venezuela, added Pinate, whose husband was fired from state oil company PDVSA by Maduros predecessor Hugo Chavez and whose two children have gone abroad. After pinning its hopes on a referendum this year - which could have triggered a presidential election and put them in power after 17 years of leftist rule - the enraged opposition Democratic Unity coalition has taken its gloves off. It is holding a symbolic political trial of Maduro in the legislature, organizing daily street protests, and shunning talks with the government that had been announced by the Vatican for this weekend.  Recalling tactics that led to a short-lived coup against Chavez in 2002 and a shutdown of the oil industry, the coalition has also called for a general strike on Friday and a march to the Miraflores presidential palace next week.  Weve reached the limit, said Henrique Capriles, a usually moderate opposition leader, calling the government Satan. Does the opposition have anything to negotiate with the government? Nothing. Why does the government want dialogue? Because the water has risen to its neck, he said.  Some hardliners, most notably veteran activist Maria Corina Machado and jailed protest leader Leopoldo Lopez wife Lilian Tintori, are calling for Gandhi-style civil disobedience.  The government is vowing an iron fist. It says well-known troublemakers, who were behind the 2002 putsch, are again seeking a coup against an elected government, with the help of the United States and compliant foreign media. I fear nobody and nothing! Maduro told red-shirted supporters at one of his daily rallies and TV appearances this week. The ruling Socialist Partys No. 2, Diosdado Cabello said any companies heeding the strike call would be seized by workers and the military. Were not going to allow craziness. Long proud of its democratic credentials after winning numerous elections under Chavez, the ruling Socialist Party says it is the opposition flouting Venezuelas democracy given that independent institutions shot down the referendum. Officials also argue that the very existence of protests and virulent public criticism of Maduro prove democracy is alive and well in Venezuela. Maduro insists the referendum decision was made by independent judges and electoral officials based on technical criteria, and denies the Socialist Party had any sway over the result. But critics say both the judiciary and electoral council have long been in the governments pocket. The Supreme Court has repeatedly shot down legislation  passed by the opposition-dominated Congress while interpreting the constitution to favor the executive branch and limit the reach of lawmakers. And the elections council has steadily shifted the requirements for requesting the recall vote. Maduro would have faced probable defeat and removal from power if the referendum had gone ahead.  His challenge now is to contain street protests and respond to deep anger among all Venezuelans at the dreadful state of the economy. Food shortages, long shopping lines and runaway prices have eroded the ruling Chavismo movements popularity among the poor and seen Maduros ratings slide to just over 20 percent.  But as unhappy as they are, disaffected former Chavistas are not yet ready to throw their lot in en masse with coalition leaders they still view with suspicion. They are all from privileged families. How can they represent me? said Orlando Diaz, 47, a mechanic and father of four from a slum in western Caracas who has seen work dry up and income tumble during a nearly three-year recession. Do I hate Maduro? Yes. He has betrayed the comandante (Chavez), he is a fool. Will I join these people in their crying and marching? No way. Frankly, I dont know where to turn. I dont see a future, I just have to find bread for my family today and tomorrow. Thats all I think about. The oppositions challenge is how to incorporate people like Diaz and his neighbors from the gritty hillside Antimano barrio, into their street push. On Wednesday, they drew hundreds of thousands nationwide, but students and traditional supporters remained at the vanguard. Scores of people on both sides were killed during anti-Maduro protests in 2014 and there was new violence on Wednesday, with dozens of injuries and arrests. A policemen was shot dead in an incident the government blamed on demonstrators.  A recall referendum in 2016 would have meant the automatic exit from power of Chavismo, said local pollster Luis Vicente Leon. Eschewing democratic codes and values, the government preferred to assume ... the risk of a popular reaction. The next presidential election is due at the end of 2018 and most Venezuelans assume another candidate will emerge from within Chavismo instead of Maduro. But given the events of recent days, opposition supporters are beginning to wonder if that election will even take place. ",politicsNews,"October 27, 2016 ",1

New Jersey 'Bridgegate' judge delays closing arguments,"NEWARK, N.J. (Reuters) - Closing arguments in New Jerseys Bridgegate trial were unexpectedly postponed by a day on Thursday because of an unspecified legal issue that must be resolved, the trial judge said.  U.S. prosecutors in Newark had been scheduled to begin summing up the evidence against two former allies of Governor Chris Christie who are accused of orchestrating lane closures at the busy George Washington Bridge to New York City in September 2013 in an act of political retribution. U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton told jurors to return on Friday morning for closing arguments, which are now expected to last into Monday. Prosecutors and defense lawyers, who also left for the day, declined to comment on the nature of the issue. Jurors have heard more than a month of testimony in the trial of Bridget Anne Kelly, Christies former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, operator of the bridge. Prosecutors say the two conspired with another Port Authority executive, David Wildstein, to create massive gridlock in Fort Lee, New Jersey, to punish the towns mayor for refusing to back Christies 2013 reelection campaign. The scandal damaged Christies political standing as he was beginning a campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. The governor is a top adviser to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Christie, who has not been charged with wrongdoing, has said he was unaware of the lane closings at the time. But testimony at the trial from several witnesses have contradicted Christies claim. Wildstein, who pleaded guilty and testified for the government, said he and Baroni discussed the plot with Christie as it was unfolding. Baroni and Kelly each took the stand and said they spoke with Christie about the lane closures, though they said they believed that the closures were part of a legitimate traffic study. Kelly, who cried several times during her testimony, portrayed Christie as a demanding and bullying boss who once flung a water bottle at her in anger. She was the author of an infamous email sent to Wildstein that said, Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee, a message prosecutors say set the scheme in motion. But Kelly told jurors that she was simply parroting the language Wildstein had used in describing the potential gridlock caused by what she believed was a Port Authority-approved traffic study.

Arkansas court strikes down a medical marijuana proposal on ballot,"(Reuters) - The Arkansas Supreme Court struck down on Thursday one of two proposals in the November election to allow for the use of medical marijuana in the state, saying the proposal did not receive the required number of signatures to be on the ballot. Voters in the Nov. 8 election in Arkansas will still be able to vote on a separate measure that would allow for the regulated use of marijuana for certain medical conditions, where a state commission oversees plant growth and marijuana distribution. The ballot proposal that was struck down was called the Arkansas Medical Cannabis Act. It had a provision for patients to apply for permission from state authorities to grow their own marijuana plants if they lived more than 20 miles (32 kms) away from an authorized dispensary. Four years ago, voters in socially conservative Arkansas narrowly rejected a proposal allowing for the use of medical marijuana. Some 24 states and Washington D.C. currently allow some type of medical marijuana use, and a handful of states allow its recreational use.    ",politicsNews,"October 27, 2016 ",1
Trump pushes Melania back onto campaign stage: interview,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Melania Trump will give two or three speeches in the final days of the U.S. presidential race, Republican candidate Donald Trump said in a television interview, apparently surprising his wife. The couple appeared in a taped ABC interview broadcast on Thursday less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 presidential election against Democrat Hillary Clinton.  Melania, who has mostly remained off the campaign trail to care for the couples 10-year-old son, was asked if she was going to campaign for her husband in the homestretch.  We will see, she said. My priority is my son Barron and I support [my husband] 100 percent and Im there for him every time he needs me. Trump indicated that time is now. She is actually going to make two or three speeches, he interjected, drawing an Oh! from his wife. Melania has stayed largely out of the public eye since the Republican National Convention in July, when she gave a speech that borrowed portions of first lady Michelle Obamas address to the 2008 Democratic convention. Shes amazing when she speaks, Trump said of his third wife, a former model from Slovenia. She is an amazing public speaker. Shes agreed to do two or three speeches, and I think its going to be big speeches, important speeches. The New York real estate mogul, who is making his first run for office, is down an average of 5.4 percentage points in national opinion polls against Clinton, a former U.S. senator and secretary of state, according to Real Clear Politics. Trump has been struggling to attract women voters after a series of damaging revelations and allegations about his treatment of women. Several women have accused him of making unwanted sexual advances, including groping or kissing, in incidents dating back to the early 1980s, according to reports in various news outlets. Trump has denied the allegations and maintained the women accusing him of sexual misconduct fabricated their stories to damage his campaign. ",politicsNews,"October 27, 2016 ",1
Tech privacy ally Feingold leads in Wisconsin Senate race,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Next months Senate election in Wisconsin could gain Silicon Valley a key ally in Washington in the high-tech industrys battle against the U.S. governments growing appetite for more access to private data.  Democrat Russ Feingold, 63, the only lawmaker to vote against the USA Patriot Act in 2001, leads incumbent Republican Senator Ron Johnson in the state in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Johnson, 61, rode a wave of support from conservative Tea Party activists to victory six years ago, sweeping Feingold out of office. But polls this year have consistently shown Feingold ahead, although recent surveys show a tighter race. Privacy advocates and former Feingold staffers said they expected Feingold, if returned to office, to be sympathetic to the privacy concerns of technology companies and civil liberties groups on issues such as encryption and domestic spying, at a time when many lawmakers are being pressured to confront security threats from Islamic State and other militant groups. The Feingold campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and other tech giants have tussled in recent years with government agencies over how much user data the companies should be forced to retain and share with investigators hunting for criminal suspects or national security threats.  Those tensions grew after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked secrets about U.S. surveillance practices in 2013. They reached a crescendo earlier this year when the FBI tried to force Apple to unlock an iPhone tied to one of the shooters in a San Bernardino, California, attack that killed 14 people.   Chief among the goals of many companies and privacy advocates is reforming a foreign intelligence authority used to justify once-secret broad internet surveillance programs exposed by Snowden that will expire in December 2017 unless Congress reauthorizes them.    Should Feingold return to Capitol Hill, former staffers said he would probably seek a seat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, where he would have privileged access to classified information about government spying. Feingolds campaign has received far more contributions than Johnsons from donors employed by tech companies including Alphabet Incs Google (GOOGL.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O), a review of U.S. Federal Election Commission records showed.  Digital privacy activists have long regarded Feingold as an ally and aggressive overseer of the intelligence community, a reputation he burnished as the sole vote against the USA Patriot Act, which was passed after the Sept. 11 attacks, expanding the governments surveillance capabilities.  In a speech from the Senate floor at the time, Feingold raised concerns that one provision would allow the government to go on a fishing expedition and collect information on virtually anyone. Leaks from Snowden in 2013 showed the provision Feingold questioned was later secretly interpreted to conduct bulk surveillance on U.S. phone metadata. That program was curtailed by Congress in 2015. Feingold was a true leader in fighting indiscriminate mass surveillance of innocent Americans, U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who also is among congressional skeptics of government spying, said in a statement. Wisconsin typically leans Democratic during high-turnout presidential election years, a problem for Johnson, who won by nearly 5 points in 2010 running as a small-government outsider. It was pretty clear that 2010 was a wave election and there was nothing that (Feingold) could have done to fend off the challenge from Ron Johnson, said Kenneth Mayer, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Johnson has attempted to use Feingolds 18-year Senate record to portray him as soft on national security. William Allison, a Johnson campaign spokesman, added that Feingold had been willing to completely mislead Wisconsinites about his weak record on national security.

"In hats and t-shirts, Trump fans rally in Jerusalem's Old City","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - On a rooftop overlooking the walls of Jerusalems Old City, around 200 American-Israeli fans of Donald Trump gathered to proclaim their support for the Republican candidate, convinced he will be Israels best friend if elected. Wearing Make America Great Again baseball caps, the small crowd, ranging from Holocaust survivors in their 80s to grinning teenagers in Trump t-shirts, said they didnt care about the sexual assault allegations against the candidate or the online anti-Semitism of some of his supporters. Trump will let Israel be itself and make its own decisions, thats what I like, David Weissman, a 35-year-old from Queens, New York, who moved to Israel three years ago, said at the event late on Wednesday. Hes not a saint, but look at his achievements. Hes not afraid to identify the enemy as radical Islam, and hes not going to support the two-state solution, he said, referring to long-standing efforts to forge peace with the Palestinians. Trump has said that the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct fabricated their stories to damage his campaign. Others at the rally said they liked the fact that Trump was promising to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, officially recognizing Jerusalem as Israels capital, and would not berate Israel for building Jewish settlements in occupied territory. Its very important that he becomes president, said Connie Gordner, 82, who moved to Israel from Jacksonville, Florida, 21 years ago. If Hillary Clinton becomes president, were dead. The rally was organized by Republicans Overseas Israel, which estimates that there are 300,000 U.S. citizens living in Israel or in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians seek for their own state. Even if only a third of those cast absentee ballots, organizers believe it could have an impact in some swing states, come Nov. 8. Marc Zell, co-chairman of the non-profit group, believes around three-quarters of American-Israelis support the Republican party and its candidate. In an impassioned speech to the small crowd, David Friedman, Trumps adviser on Israel, heaped criticism on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for her decisions as secretary of state and said Trump was Israels greatest hope. Under Trump, the United States will never pressure Israel into accepting a two-state solution or any other solution that is against the wishes of the Israeli people, he said, to whoops, cheers and a few shouts of Crooked Hillary. While the motley crowd was unabashed in its Trumpian fervor, polls indicate that most Jewish Israelis favor Clinton over Trump, by 40 percent to 31 percent. The critical element is American-Israelis who retain the right to vote in U.S. elections. Some estimates suggest more than a quarter of them live in settlements, which tend to have a more conservative, national-religious outlook. Trumps messages have been designed to appeal to their sentiments. On Wednesday, he delivered a minute-long video to the rally, playing up his connections to Judaism through his daughters marriage, saying it enhanced his respect for the faith. My administration will stand side-by-side with the Jewish people and Israels leaders to continue strengthening the bridges that connect not only Jewish Americans and Israelis but also all Americans and Israelis, he said. Together we will make America and Israel safe again. ",politicsNews,"October 27, 2016 ",1
"More Republicans expect Clinton, rather than Trump, to win U.S. election","NEW YORK (Reuters) - More Republicans now think Democrat Hillary Clinton, rather than Donald Trump, will win the presidency, as their partys candidate struggles with difficulties including allegations of sexual misconduct and his suggestion he may not honor the outcome of the election. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday and conducted from Oct. 20 to Oct. 24 found that 41 percent of Republicans expected Clinton to win the Nov. 8 election, versus 40 percent who picked Trump. That reflected a sharp decline in confidence from last month, when 58 percent of Republicans said they thought their partys nominee would win, versus 23 percent who expected Clinton to prevail.  Among Trumps supporters, 49 percent in the latest poll said they believed Trump would win, down from 67 percent who felt that way at the beginning of the month. Theres still hope, I guess. I just dont have a great deal of faith in a good portion of the American public, said Bert Horsley, 38, of Belgrade, Montana, who said he planned to vote for Trump even though he believed Clinton would win.  Horsley said he felt the country was leaning increasingly socialist and that voters were more inclined to focus on Trumps problems than on issues facing Clinton, including allegations she mishandled classified emails while secretary of state. The nations willing to overlook certain things in some people and not in others, he said. Despite the growing pessimism, Trump, who trails Clinton in national opinion polls, still enjoys overwhelming support from members of his party. Some 79 percent of likely Republican voters said they would vote for him. Many said their support was rooted in an expectation he would promote a conservative agenda in Congress and appoint conservative justices to the Supreme Court.     Democrats appear to be strongly anticipating a Clinton presidency. Some 83 percent of Democrats said in the poll they thought she would win, while only 8 percent predicted Trump would become president. Among Clintons supporters, 92 percent expected her to win, up from 83 percent a month earlier. Clinton held a commanding lead in the race to win the Electoral College and claim the presidency, according to results from the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project released on Saturday. Trump, a businessman and former reality television star, has alarmed mainstream Republicans throughout his campaign by routinely bashing the political establishment and making a series of provocative statements.  He aroused criticism for belittling the parents of a U.S. soldier killed in the Iraq war, calling for a ban on admitting Muslims to the country and accusing a judge of bias because of his Hispanic heritage. He has also asserted, without showing evidence, that the U.S. electoral system is rigged. But Republicans remained mostly confident in their candidates chances until this month, when a videotape from 2005 was released in which Trump could be heard bragging in vulgar terms about kissing and groping women.  At least 10 women have since accused Trump of making unwanted sexual advances, including groping or kissing, from the early 1980s to 2007, according to reports in various news outlets. Trump has denied the womens allegations, calling them totally and absolutely false and has promised to sue the women after the election. Trump has also deepened divisions within his party by refusing to promise to accept the outcome of the election. I will keep you in suspense, he said when asked about the issue  during an Oct. 19 debate with Clinton. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English with American adults in all 50 states. The latest poll included 648 people who identified as Republicans and 771 people who identified as Democrats. It had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 4 percentage points.

Trump touts urban policy following detour to open new hotel,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, in an appeal on Wednesday to African-Americans and working-class voters, promised 21st century banking industry reforms and tax changes to spur job creation and investment in blighted communities. Delivering an urban policy speech two weeks before the Nov. 8 election, Trump highlighted his plan to ease access to bank credit for young blacks trying to start businesses and create jobs in their communities. The New York businessman, who trails Democrat Hillary Clinton in national opinion polls and is struggling to appeal to African-Americans and Latinos, also called for broader tax incentives to spur inner-city investment. The steps, coupled with efforts to reduce U.S. trade deficits and the outsourcing of jobs abroad, Trump said, would raise wages at home, meaning rent and bills become instantly more affordable for the poor. Trump flew to Charlotte, a major commercial hub in the U.S. South, after attending the formal opening in Washington of a Trump International Hotel just blocks from the White House. Trumps detour from the campaign trail to plug his business drew criticism from some fellow Republicans, but the former reality TV star said the project, completed under budget and ahead of schedule, showed what he could accomplish if elected president. His Democratic rival, Clinton, said: Donald Trump is actually paying more attention to his business than to the campaign. Thats his choice, but were going to keep working really hard to reach as many voters as possible. Speaking to reporters during a flight to New York after campaigning in Florida, Clinton also said the proposed merger of AT&T Inc and Time Warner Inc raises questions and concerns and they should be looked into. In Charlotte, Trump provided few details of 21st century Glass-Steagall, which would build on the 1933 Depression-era law requiring the separation of commercial and investment banking. Glass-Steagall was repealed in 1999 under then-President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clintons husband. The 2008 financial crisis prompted an overhaul of banking rules with the passage in 2010 of Dodd-Frank Wall Street reforms that many Republicans have criticized. Dodd-Frank has been a disaster, making it harder for small businesses to get the credit they need, Trump said. Trump, speaking to a mostly white audience after meeting with black religious leaders, said he would step up the police presence in U.S. cities so that every poor African-American child can walk on the streets in safety. Safety is a civil right. The problem is not the presence of police but the absence of police, he said. Last month, hundreds of demonstrators protested in Charlotte after the release of videos showing the fatal shooting of a black man by police officers. While Trumps speech stuck mainly to policy initiatives, he also got in a jab at Clinton. Honestly, she has less energy than Jeb Bush, Trump said, criticizing Clintons stamina and harking back to his charges that Bush, a former rival for the Republican nomination, was low energy. Clinton told reporters that there was not an ounce of complacency in her campaign and said that if elected, she would reach out to Republicans and independents, including congressional leaders, both before the inauguration and to continue afterwards. Before Trumps Charlotte speech, much of Wednesdays media attention focused on Trumps appearance at his new, 263-room luxury hotel. Republican strategist Steve Schmidt, who led 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCains unsuccessful campaign, said the hotel stop was the latest inexplicable act from Trump and atypical behavior for someone trying to win the White House.  The walls are collapsing, Schmidt told MSNBC in an interview. He is not doing any of the normal activities that youd be doing 13 days out in a presidential race for somebody whos competitive. You dont take a time-out to tend to your business interests. Trump, making his first run for elected office, often highlights his business accomplishments and has held numerous events at his properties since launching his White House bid last year, including a trip to Scotland to open a refurbished golf resort in June. Asked after the event why he was in Washington instead of campaigning in a battleground state, Trump told CNN it was a very rude question and said he worked hard on the trail every day. I cant take one hour off to cut a ribbon at one of the great hotels of the world? I mean, I think Im entitled to it, Trump told ABC News. He said there was a double standard, noting that Clinton was not criticized for taking time to see the singer Adele in concert on Tuesday night. Clinton campaigned on Wednesday in Florida, where many opinion polls show a tight race. An average of Florida polls compiled by RealClearPolitics showed Clinton at 46.4 percent compared with 44.8 percent for Trump in a race including third-party candidates. Clinton has a strong lead in the race to secure the 270 Electoral College votes - or tally of wins from the states - needed to capture the White House, according to results from Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project released on Saturday.

"To applause and boos, Kerry urges Congress to ratify Pacific trade pact","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Failure to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal would be a major setback for U.S. interests in Asia as Washington seeks to deepen alliances in the region, Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday, urging Congress to ratify the pact. The 12-nation Pan-Pacific trade deal championed by President Barack Obama has been pilloried by both major-party nominees in the U.S. presidential race, Democrat Hilary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. While Republicans have traditionally backed free trade deals, Trump has blamed them for U.S. job losses and threatened to rip them up or renegotiate them if he wins the Nov. 8 election.  If we see the TPP rejected, it would be a gigantic self-inflicted wound  a setback to our own interests in the region, Kerry told the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, in remarks that drew a smattering of applause and boos. It would amount to a conscious turning of our backs on the Asia Pacific at the very moment that we ought to be linking arms  it would be an act that will hurt American workers, slow our economy, hinder our ability to advance the full range of U.S. objectives in the fast-growing region, he added. Republican leaders have said there is no point in bringing the trade deal for a vote in the lame-duck session of Congress after the election.  But Kerry urged Congress to approve the deal after the election, saying: Its the right thing to do for America  and no matter what the loudest voices may be shouting  it is also the popular choice.  There are concerns in Washington that failure to pass the TPP would prompt Southeast Asian nations to turn to China and Russia. Kerry said the trade deal was a litmus test of Washingtons capacity to lead and was necessary if the United States wanted a steady and reliable presence in the region. His comments came amid tensions with China over the disputed South China Sea, increased concerns over North Koreas missile and nuclear weapons programs, and questions over the future of the U.S.-Philippines alliance.

Factbox: Wall Street's take on possible impact of U.S. elections,"(Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump are in a tight race ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.  Following is a weekly roundup of financial market analysts views on the likely outcome of the U.S. elections and the possible implications of a Trump or Clinton win on financial markets.   MORE COVERAGE: bit.ly/2dOgcoE SEE RELATED FACTBOX: reut.rs/2ewdRdg LARRY BIEGELSEN, SENIOR ANALYST, HEALTHCARE TEAM, WELLS FARGO The probability of either a Republican or a Democratic sweep of both the Executive and Legislative branches is low, but certainly not negligible. We think these scenarios would be more volatile for stocks. REPUBLICAN SWEEP: Positive for devices, pharma, biotech, tools and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Negative for managed care, facilities and digital health stocks  DEMOCRATIC SWEEP: Positive for managed care, facilities and digital health stocks. Negative for devices, pharma, biotech, tools and PBMs With Trumps chances fading, and Clintons lead growing, the Democratic Sweep now carries greater  albeit still small  odds, raising the prospects for increased infrastructure spending (a positive bias for risk assets) and for heavier regulation of the financial and pharma sectors (a negative bias for both).                 We think short-term risk for the broader U.S. equity market has been reduced, but not eliminated. In many investors minds, the perceived risks associated with a Trump victory in the Presidential race have been replaced with concerns about the implications of a Democratic sweep of leadership in Congress (for both the Senate and House to flip). CLINTON WIN: Near-term, the increased chance of a Clinton victory seems good for stocks with high international exposure and industrials. In the case of industrials, we see a fundamental underpinning of support from a Clinton victory in the form of plans to increase infrastructure spending. The fundamental picture for consumer discretionary is a bit trickier, given Clintons support for an increase in the minimum wage and the likely increase in operating expenses that would result for many companies. TRUMP WIN: The financials and health care sectors have been trading more in line with Trumps prospects for victory this year, which we think is due to fears over increased regulatory pressures for both sectors under a Clinton-led White House. That being said, we think any future election-driven weakness in these sectors could be short-lived and note that the relationships between these sectors and Trumps polling numbers may already be starting to break down a bit.     A Democratic sweep, though still unlikely, might be met with concern on Wall Street as the prospect of higher taxes enters the fray.  Republican control of the House would stymie legislation that raised taxes across a wide swath and thus Democratic control of Congress alongside the resident of the Oval Office could lead to laws that might not be well received and could be seen as divisive (similar to the Affordable Care Act). Notably, moves to broaden entitlements including free college education could be passed with single party control but most likely would be blocked by a Republican Speaker of the House. One would expect Secretary Clinton to want to be a successful president and thus a more forceful economic agenda will be necessary to achieve that aim. While attempts at bipartisanship are likely specifically where there is some meeting of the minds, including areas like infrastructure spending and some tax reforms, there are several areas that may be controversial such as some of the planned tax increases. Nonetheless, most political observers think Clinton would be far more willing to reach out for compromise than Obama did. A Brexit-style surprise in the U.S. presidential election is very unlikely... comparisons between the surprise outcome in the UK referendum vote earlier this year and the upcoming U.S. presidential election are hard to avoid, but we think the differences outweigh the similarities. Most importantly, polling in the UK was much closer, and much less consistent, than it has been in the us presidential campaign this year.    JARET SEIBERG, COWEN WASHINGTON RESEARCH GROUP, COWEN AND COMPANY BANKS, HOUSING POLICY: Sec. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have now faced off in three presidential debates without a material discussion of banks or housing. This tells us that Congress will likely shape banking policy with either Sen. Elizabeth Warren or Rep. Jeb Hensarling taking (the) lead, depending on the winner. For housing, we see both candidates as a positive, though Trump may be better for Fannie and Freddie. JUSTIN WOLFERS, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND NBER, AND ERIC ZITZEWITZ, DARTMOUTH COLLEGE AND NBER MARKET OUTLOOK: The S&P 500 futures rose by 0.71 percent during the debate window in response to a 6 percent increase in Clintons victory probability. This implies that market participants believe that the S&P 500 will be worth 12 percent more under a President Clinton. Movements in other U.S. stock indices tell a similar story. A 12 percent difference is large both in absolute terms, and relative to how previous political shocks have moved the market.  MARKET VOLATILITY: During the debate, futures tracking expected future U.S. stock market volatility fell sharply, suggesting that markets are more uncertain about outcomes under a Trump presidency. Oil prices rose, gold prices fell and Treasury prices declined slightly. Roughly speaking, these movements suggest that a Clinton presidency is expected to lead to stock market volatility that is 15-30 percent lower, Treasury yields that are 25 basis points higher, and oil that is $4 per barrel more expensive.  GLOBAL MARKETS: Movements in overseas markets suggest that the U.S. election is expected to have significant global implications. The debate led the British FTSE 100 to rise by as much as U.S. stocks did. The same is true of many Asian markets, too... The currencies of Mexico and Canada  both of which are partners in NAFTA, which Trump has threatened to end or renegotiate  rose sharply, as did those of other nations with which the U.S. has free trade agreements... All told, these movements suggest that financial markets expect a generally healthier domestic and international economy under a President Clinton than under a President Trump.

Democrats ask judge to sanction Republicans over Trump,"(Reuters) - The Democratic National Committee on Wednesday asked a U.S. judge to hold the Republican National Committee in contempt of court over allegations that Donald Trump encouraged his supporters to intimidate minority voters. The DNC accused Republicans in a court filing of violating a longstanding consent decree, which restricts Republicans ability to question voters at the polls and prevent those people from casting a ballot.  During the presidential campaign, Republican nominee Trump has asked followers to watch for fraud in the Nov.8 presidential election in certain areas where minority voters reside, even though no evidence of fraud exists, the filing said. Some of Trumps followers have pledged to do just that, the filing said. The RNC has supported Trumps ballot security endeavors, Democrats said in the court filing. The RNC said the filing was completely meritless.  The RNC strictly abides by the consent decree and does not take part directly or indirectly in any efforts to prevent or remedy vote fraud. Nor do we coordinate with the Trump campaign or any other campaign or party organization in any efforts they may make in this area, a RNC spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The RNC remains focused on getting out the vote. Representatives for the Trump campaign could not immediately be reached for comment. The DNC asked a New Jersey federal judge to issue an injunction preventing the RNC from spending money on voter integrity efforts, and to instruct its field offices that no employee shall participate in any ballot security measures.

U.S. abstains for first time on U.N. call for end to Cuba embargo,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday abstained for the first time from a United Nations General Assembly vote on a resolution calling for an end to a U.S. economic embargo on Cuba, after opposing such measures every year for 24 years. For the 25th time, the 193-member General Assembly adopted the resolution with 191 votes in favor. Israel, which opposed the resolution last year, also abstained on Wednesday. Such resolutions are non-binding, but can carry political weight. Communist-run Cuba and the United States, former Cold War foes, began normalizing relations in 2014. U.S. President Barack Obama has taken steps to ease trade and travel restrictions on Cuba, but only the U.S. Congress can lift the full embargo. The Republican-controlled Congress has resisted Obamas call to lift Washingtons economic embargo after more than 50 years. Republican critics say Obama is making too many concessions to Cuba for too little in return, especially on human rights. The U.N. General Assembly applauded when U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power announced prior to the vote that the United States would abstain. Abstaining on this resolution does not mean that the United States agrees with all of the policies and practices of the Cuban government. We do not, Power told the General Assembly.  We are profoundly concerned by the serious human rights violations that the Cuban government continues to commit with impunity against its own people, she said. Cubas Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez described the abstention as a positive step for the future of improving relations between the United States and Cuba. Rodriguez said in September that damage from U.S. sanctions between April 2015 and March 2016 amounted to $4.6 billion and to $125.9 billion since the embargos inception more than 50 years ago. In March, Obama made the first visit to Havana by a U.S. president in 88 years. His trip was made possible by his breakthrough agreement with Cuban President Raul Castro in December 2014 to cast aside decades of hostility that began soon after Cubas 1959 revolution. Since the opening, Obama has repeatedly used his executive powers to relax trade and travel restrictions, while pushing Cuba to accelerate market-style reforms and boost political and economic freedoms. The U.N. resolution adopted on Wednesday takes note of the steps taken by Obama as positive but still limited in scope. It urges the United States to repeal or invalidate the embargo on Cuba as soon as possible. ",politicsNews,"October 26, 2016 ",1
Republicans may be on verge of losing U.S. Senate majority: aides,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican Partys two-year run in the majority of the U.S. Senate is at serious risk and may well end on Nov. 8, senior congressional aides said on Wednesday, blaming Donald Trump as a drag on down-ballot Republican candidates. With 13 days to go before elections, several Senate aides from both parties privately warned of trouble for Republicans. Things are not good ... the Senate is gone, said one Republican aide who asked not to be identified in order to candidly discuss the turbulent outlook for the 2016 campaign. Citing opinion polling, the aide said Republicans could lose Senate seats in six battleground states: Pennsylvania, Illinois, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Missouri. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday and conducted from Oct. 20 to Oct. 24 found that 41 percent of Republicans now expect Clinton to win the election, versus 40 percent for Trump. That is a sharp decline in confidence from last month, when 58 percent of Republicans said they thought their partys nominee would win, versus 23 percent for Clinton. Republicans now hold 54 of the Senates 100 seats. Democrats must snatch four seats to win a majority, provided their presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, beats Trump. That would make Clintons running mate, Tim Kaine, the tie-breaking Senate vote since the vice president votes in order to break a tie. On Tuesday, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report predicted  Democrats would gain five to seven seats. Such a result would leave them short of the 60 votes needed to easily get things done in the Senate, but it would provide a majority. A less pessimistic Senate Republican aide said Senate control still could go either way but sketched out problems. In Pennsylvania, the aide said, Senator Pat Toomey has to fight off dead weight at the top of the ticket, referring to Trump. In Missouri, he said, Democrat Jason Kander, who is trying to unseat Senator Roy Blunt, is a great candidate.  Nationally, the reason we dont hold the Senate, if we dont, is because of Donald Trump, the aide said. Of course, this has been a volatile and unpredictable year, and there is still time for trends to reverse. Democrats stressed they are not breaking out the champagne. According to RealClear Politics, Toomey leads by 1.8 percentage points in Pennsylvania while Blunt is up by a point in strongly Republican Missouri and Senator Richard Burr has a 2.8-point lead in North Carolina over his Democratic challenger. Still, a senior Senate Democratic aide said, We have a lot more paths to a majority than they do. Republicans entered the 2016 Senate races at a disadvantage, having to defend 24 seats to only 10 for Democrats. Democratic President Barack Obama, who is still relatively popular, won at least one of his two White House races in most of the states where Republicans currently are struggling, such as New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Nevada. Clinton leads Trump by about 5 points in some national polls. Studies show a pattern of voting in recent decades in which the outcome of Senate races has had a significant correlation to who wins the White House. Polling in the hardest-fought states points to extremely close races with Republican incumbents backs against the wall. In New Hampshire, Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte is in a tough race with her Democratic challenger, Governor Maggie Hassan. University of New Hampshire political science professor Dante Scala said Republican senators in that state and Pennsylvania face the one-two punch of independent voters potentially being turned off by Trump and an electorate that leans Democratic in presidential election years like 2016. Given the overall environment, it tilts to Hassan, Scala said. ",politicsNews,"October 26, 2016 ",1
Trump calls for '21st century' Glass-Steagall banking law,"(Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday called for a 21st century version of the 1933 Glass-Steagall law that required the separation of commercial and investment banking, a change the Republican Party also supported in its 2016 policy platform. Trump gave no details about his banking plan other than to say he would prioritize helping African American businesses get the credit they need.  Democrat Hillary Clintons husband, former president Bill Clinton, signed legislation in 1999 that repealed Glass-Steagall. U.S. banking law was comprehensively revised by the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010 as a response to the financial crisis of 2008.

Donald Trump's Hollywood Walk of Fame star vandalized on video,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Donald Trumps star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was defaced by a vandal wielding a sledgehammer and a pick-axe on Wednesday in an act captured on video, police said. Los Angeles police expect to arrest someone for the vandalism, which left Trumps name scratched out of the star, the emblem in the middle dislodged and chips missing.      A video posted at Deadline.com, a Hollywood media industry website, showed a man wearing a hard-hat and reflective vest swinging a sledgehammer and pick-axe in the pre-dawn darkness. (To see the Deadline.com video, click on this link: bit.ly/2dWGEdf ) The area had been cordoned off with traffic barriers and cones, giving it the appearance of a legitimate work site. The Republican presidential nominee, real estate developer and reality TV star has faced several large protests during his campaign appearances in California, where polls show him far behind Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The former host of the NBC show The Apprentice, Trump received his Walk of Fame star in 2007. A spokeswoman for Trump could not be reached for comment.  Los Angeles police spokeswoman Liliana Preciado at the scene confirmed investigators have video capturing the vandalism attack and she said police expected to arrest whoever was responsible. Los Angeles-based City News Service reported a man identifying himself as James Lambert Otis said he damaged the installation to make a point. City News reported the man said he had family members who were victims of sexual assault and had intended to remove the star, which he was unable to do, and auction it off to benefit women who have alleged Trump groped them. Trump has denied the allegations. Otis could not be reached for comment on the report. Trump drew widespread condemnations from voters and a number of Republican elected officials after a 2005 video emerged in which he was heard talking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. His star on the Walk of Fame was previously targeted. In the summer, a street artist erected a tiny wall around the star, complete with miniature American flags and barbed wire. The art piece, which was later removed, made light of Trumps campaign pledge to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce administers the hundreds of star plaques on sidewalks in the Los Angeles neighborhood. They are purchased for $30,000 each. Leron Gubler, president and CEO of the chamber, said in a statement the star would be covered for several days during repairs. ",politicsNews,"October 26, 2016 ",1

"Top executive behind Dakota Access has donated more than $100,000 to Trump","HOUSTON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top executive at the company behind the embattled Dakota Access Pipeline has donated more than $100,000 to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump since June, according to campaign finance disclosure records. The donations by Kelcy Warren, chairman and chief executive officer at pipeline operator Energy Transfer Partners, support the candidate seen by many as more likely to promote the U.S. oil and gas industry than his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. Warren donated $300 to the Trump campaign during the primaries, and $2,700 to Trump during the general election phase of the campaign, for the maximum contribution allowed by a single individual during an election.  He also gave $100,000 to the Trump Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee that includes the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee, the Republican Party of Arkansas and the Connecticut Republican Party.  The donations, first reported by the British newspaper The Guardian, were made before the U.S. government halted construction on a segment of Energy Transfer Partners 1,100-mile (1,770-km) Dakota Access Pipeline in early September following protests by Native American and environmental groups.  The project, which would move oil from the highly productive Bakken shale formation to the Midwest and Gulf Coast, sparked violent clashes between security officers near the construction site and Native American tribe members and other protesters. Opponents have said the project will damage burial sites considered sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and pollute the areas drinking water.  Warren has also given $66,800 to the Republication National Committee since Trump secured the nomination for the Nov. 8 election, The Guardian reported. Trump has not yet taken a position on the Dakota Access Pipeline, but supports the development of oil and gas and related infrastructure, including pipelines. Asked about Trumps position on the Dakota Access Pipeline in a policy debate this week, U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, one of the candidates main energy advisers, declined to answer, saying he did not want to get ahead of Trump. He added, Im not sure he (Trump) is aware of it.  If elected, Trump in his first 100 days will ask TransCanada to renew its permit application for the Keystone XL Pipeline, according to his campaign website. U.S. President Barack Obama rejected the proposed pipeline from Canada last November. Trump has holdings in Energy Transfer Partners and Phillips 66, a joint owner of the Dakota Access Pipeline, through mutual funds, according to financial disclosure records. U.S. oil and gas industry workers have contributed slightly more to Clinton, with employees giving $114,141 to the Democratic candidate and $99,302 to Trump since July, according to a Reuters review of federal campaign finance disclosures.

"Clinton leading among young voters, Harvard poll finds","BOSTON (Reuters) - Democratic White House candidate Hillary Clinton is leading among likely voters aged 18 to 29, according to a Harvard University opinion poll released on Wednesday. The former U.S. secretary of state had the support of 49 percent of likely voters, ahead of Republican rival Donald Trumps 28 percent support, a substantially wider lead than Democratic President Barack Obama had over Republican former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney at the same point in 2012. National polls of voters of all ages also show Clinton leading, though by a substantially narrower margin. Some 14 percent of respondents said they planned to vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson, with 5 percent supporting the Green Partys Jill Stein and 11 percent still undecided. More than one in three self-described Johnson voters said they were likely to change their minds before Election Day. A majority of respondents, 51 percent, described themselves as fearful about the future of America, with just 14 percent of the 2,150 respondents saying they believed the country was headed in the right direction. The sense of fearfulness was most predominant among white respondents, though 85 of black respondents said they believed they were under attack in modern American society. Some 62 percent of respondents said they believed race relations in the United States would worsen if Trump was elected president. Twenty-two percent thought race relations would deteriorate if Clinton won the Nov. 8 election, with the plurality, 36 percent predicting they would stay the same. The survey, conducted Oct. 7-17 has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points, meaning results could vary that much either way. ",politicsNews,"October 26, 2016 ",1
Republican hold on U.S. state legislatures could slip in election,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Republican Partys grip on U.S. state legislatures could loosen in next months election as Democrats seek to link Republican candidates to the sinking fortunes of the partys White House candidate, Donald Trump. Republicans, who have dominated control of legislatures since the mid-term election in 2010, currently hold the majority in 67 of the countrys 98 partisan legislative chambers, while Democrats have 31. Nebraskas single chamber is nonpartisan. More than 80 percent of the nation's 7,383 state legislative seats are up for grabs on Nov. 8 and the race between Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is expected to influence races further down the ballot papers. (See related graphic tmsnrt.rs/2ePmLDI) The bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) estimates 18 legislative chambers in 12 states could switch party control, including in Arizona, Colorado, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nevada, Washington and Wisconsin. More than three-fourths of the time the party winning the White House also makes gains in state legislatures. So the odds are Democrats would pick up chambers and seats on the whole if (Clinton) wins, said Tim Storey, a NCSL elections analyst. National opinion polls show Clinton leading Trump with just under two weeks to go until Election Day. Democrats are also getting a big boost for down ballot races with Clinton surrogates such as President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and first lady Michelle Obama on the campaign trail stumping for party candidates.  Trump, on the other hand, is openly feuding with Republican leaders, many of whom distanced themselves from the candidate after a 2005 video surfaced earlier this month in which he is heard bragging about groping women and making other unwanted sexual advances. Storey said while Trump has his pockets of popularity, the top Republican on the partys ticket has become a main line of attack by Democrats in swing districts.  Instead of taxes or health care or public safety or education, Trump has been an issue in many places, he said. According to Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), which is working to elect Democratic state lawmakers, Trump is quicksand for legislative Republicans. But Matt Walter, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC), which hopes to spend $40 million on legislative and other state races this election cycle, said the Democrats strategy of using Trump to campaign against Republicans is not working. He contended his partys candidates can win even without presidential coattails. A good candidate who understands her district, who presents viable solutions for that district in that state has a better than even odds of winning in any type of environment, he said. In addition to defending legislative turf, Republicans are trying to play offense, targeting 13 chambers in 10 states for seat gains, including Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Vermont, Colorado and Oregon. Post said Democratic candidates are offering voters a crucial firewall against Republican overreach in states dominated by Republicans, like North Carolina, where there has been a backlash against a law on use of public bathrooms that critics say discriminates against transgender people.   With all of Minnesotas legislative seats up for election, Democrats need a net gain of seven seats to take control of the House and turn the state, which has a Democratic governor, in their favor. Larry Jacobs, a University of Minnesota political science professor, said a Democratic sweep could open the way for  legislation funding capital projects and transportation as well as early childhood education. In Illinois, Republican Governor Bruce Rauner, his wife and two of his wealthiest donors have contributed a combined $18 million since the March primary to House Republican leader Jim Durkin and to a super-PAC devoted to chipping away at Democrats veto-proof majorities in the states House and Senate. Democrats have been in a political stalemate with Rauner for nearly two years over the budget and other issues. In West Virginia, historically a Democratic stronghold state, Republicans took control of the states House, Senate, and governors office in 2014 for the first time in 83 years. This election, Democrats want the Senate back. Tom Susman, president of TSG Consulting, a Charleston, West Virginia-based government affairs public relations firm, said the likely scenario is the Senate remains Republican, with much of the power ceded to a growing fiscally conservative faction. Moderate Republicans are in trouble, said Susman. We could be looking at a Kansas-like situation. Then, it would basically be the Tea Party running the state Senate. No new taxes. All cuts.

Getting North Korea to give up nuclear bomb probably 'lost cause': U.S. spy chief,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. policy of trying to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons is probably a lost cause and the best that could be hoped for is a cap on the countrys nuclear capability, the Director of U.S. National Intelligence James Clapper said on Tuesday. However, underscoring conflicting views in the Obama administration, the State Department said U.S. policy was unchanged and continued to be to seek the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. President Barack Obama has repeatedly stated that the United States will never accept North Korean as a nuclear-armed state. Clapper made clear at an event at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank in New York he did not think that the policy the administration has stuck to, in spite of repeated North Korean nuclear tests, was realistic. I think the notion of getting the North Koreans to denuclearize is probably a lost cause, Clapper said at the  Council on Foreign Relations think tank in New York. They are not going to do that - that is their ticket to survival. Pyongyang has persisted with its missile and nuclear weapons programs, including a Sept. 9 nuclear explosion, despite strong international sanctions. Clapper said he got a good taste of how the world looks from North Koreas viewpoint when he went to Pyongyang on a mission in 2014 to secure the release of two Americans. They are under siege and they are very paranoid, so the notion of giving up their nuclear capability, whatever it is, is a non-starter with them, he said. The best we could probably hope for is some sort of a cap, but they are not going to do that just because we ask them. Theres going to have to be some significant inducements. U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby said he had not seen Clappers remarks but told a regular news briefing in Washington that the administration did not believe denuclearization was a lost cause. No, nothings changed ... thats not our position. Our policy objective is to seek to obtain a verifiable denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. That is the policy; that is both the goal and what we want to see and there is a way to do that. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, asked on Wednesday about Clappers remarks, said the best way to resolve the North Korea nuclear issue was still via talks. China and Russia have pushed for a resumption of six-party talks on denuclearization in North Korea. The talks, which also involve Japan, South Korea and the United States, have been on hold since 2008. Clapper also said it bothered him that the United States was not capitalizing on using information as a weapon against North Korea. Thats something they worry about a lot ... That is a great vulnerability I dont think we have exploited. Right now, we are kind of stuck on our narrative and they are kind of stuck on theirs. Clapper was asked if he thought North Korea could mount a nuclear warhead on a missile that could reach the West Coast of the United States and reiterated the intelligence assessment that this had to be a worst-case assumption. He said North Korea had yet to test its KN08 intercontinental ballistic missile, so neither North Korea nor the United States knew whether it worked. Nevertheless, we ascribe to them the capability to launch a missile that would have a weapon on it to reach parts of the United States, certainly including Alaska and Hawaii, he said. They could do it. We have to make the worst-case assumption here. ",politicsNews,"October 25, 2016 ",1

Exclusive: Trump says Clinton policy on Syria would lead to World War Three," DORAL, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Democrat Hillary Clintons plan for Syria would lead to World War Three, because of the potential for conflict with military forces from nuclear-armed Russia.  In an interview focused largely on foreign policy, Trump said defeating Islamic State is a higher priority than persuading Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, playing down a long-held goal of U.S. policy.  Trump questioned how Clinton would negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin after demonizing him; blamed President Barack Obama for a downturn in U.S. relations with the Philippines under its new president, Rodrigo Duterte; bemoaned a lack of Republican unity behind his candidacy, and said he would easily win the election if the party leaders would support him.  If we had party unity, we couldnt lose this election to Hillary Clinton, he said.  On Syrias civil war, Trump said Clinton could drag the United States into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict.  Clinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and safe zones on the ground to protect non-combatants. Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets.  What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria, said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. Youre going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.  Youre not fighting Syria any more, youre fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk, he said.  Clintons campaign dismissed the criticism, noting that both Republican and Democratic national security experts have denounced Trump as unfit to be commander-in-chief.  Once again, he is parroting Putins talking points and playing to Americans fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria, Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said in a statement.  Trump said Assad is much stronger now than he was three years ago and said getting Assad to leave power was less important than defeating Islamic State.  Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIS, he said.    On Russia, Trump again knocked Clintons handling of U.S.-Russian relations while secretary of state and said her harsh criticism of Putin raised questions about how she is going to go back and negotiate with this man who she has made to be so evil, if she wins the presidency.  On the deterioration of ties with the Philippines, Trump aimed his criticism at Obama, saying the president wants to focus on his golf game rather than engage with world leaders.  Since assuming office, Duterte has expressed open hostility toward the United States, rejecting criticism of his violent anti-drug clampdown, using an expletive to describe Obama and telling the United States not to treat his country like a dog with a leash.  The Obama administration has expressed optimism that the two countries can remain firm allies.  Trump said Dutertes latest comments showed a lack of respect for our country.  The interview comes two weeks before the Nov. 8 election, with Trump trailing badly in the polls. He repeated his assertion that the media is rigging the polls and said his supporters were upset with Republican Party leadership.  The people are very angry with the leadership of this party, because this is an election that we will win 100 percent if we had support from the top. I think were going to win it anyway.  He said if he wins he would not consider putting Democrats in his cabinet but would work with them on legislation.

Trump: Obama should be investigated over Clinton email server,"DORAL, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Tuesday that President Barack Obama should be investigated over a private email server Hillary Clinton used while secretary of state, saying Obama knew all about her email arrangements. Thats why he stuck up for Hillary, because he didnt want to be dragged in. Because he knew all about her private server, Trump said of the Democratic president in an interview with Reuters. This means that he has to be investigated. The White House declined to comment on Trumps allegations. Spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters earlier on Tuesday that while the president had Clintons personal email address, which she used instead of government systems, he did not know where her server was located or other details. Clinton, Trumps Democratic rival in the Nov. 8 election, was Obamas first secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. WikiLeaks on Tuesday released a batch of hacked emails from the account of Clintons campaign manager, John Podesta, which showed her Democratic presidential campaign reacting after Obama said in a television interview that he learned of the private email server through news reports.  We need to clean this up  he has emails from her  they do not say state.gov, Cheryl Mills, a longtime Clinton aide, wrote in an email to Podesta after Obama made the comments in a March 2015 television interview. State.gov is the State Departments internet domain name, and its presence in the senders email address would indicate it came from an official account. The State Department said in January it found 18 instances  of messages between Clinton and Obama among the roughly 30,000 work emails Clinton returned to the department in 2014. None have been released because of a law that protects presidential communications from becoming public for several years.  WikiLeaks has been releasing hacked emails in chunks for several weeks, but the Clinton campaign has not officially confirmed their legitimacy. U.S. officials have said they believe Russia is behind recent hacks of Democratic Party systems, and reports have indicated the theft of Podestas emails may be related.  Russian President Vladimir Putin has said his country is not to blame. Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey in July said Clinton was extremely careless with her emails but that no reasonable prosecutor would bring charges.

Highlights from Reuters' exclusive interview with Donald Trump,"(Reuters) - Below are the highlights from Reuters Oct. 25 exclusive interview with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.  (Hillary Clinton) has no plan for Syria. Look, with her youll end up in World War Three. She doesnt know what shes doing, just like with Libya, just like with everything else shes done. So Syria now is no longer Syria. Syria is Russia and the new Iran that we built through the Iran deal, which is one of the worst negotiated deals Ive ever seen. So youre not fighting Syria anymore, youre fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, alright. Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk. I say the first thing we have to do is get rid of ISIS before we start thinking about Syria.  (Syrian President Bashar al-)Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIS. If Hillary Clinton ended the war and left troops behind, we wouldnt even be fighting for Mosul right now, OK. She gave them Mosul. She didnt know what she was doing. The woman is incompetent. One of the reasons we were going in was to get the ISIS leaders. But if thats the case, why didnt we go in as a surprise attack instead of - you know, with the element of surprise - instead of announcing three months ago that were going into Mosul? I would hope to have a good relationship with Russia. And I would hope to have a good relationship with Putin. Im not friends or enemies with the Russians. I have nothing to do Russia. (Clinton) always casts Putin as a bad guy and a bad light. If she won, how is she going to go back and negotiate with this man who she has made to be so evil. Hes not going to want to negotiate with her, number one. Number two, I dont believe he has any respect for Hillary Clinton whatsoever.  On Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte saying he was against the presence of any foreign troops in his country: He probably made a deal with China... Hes dealing with China and Russia so he probably made a deal with China and Russia. The Philippines are a very important strategic location. He has no respect or liking of Obama ... I think its a horrible thing that the United States is reduced to being thrown out of a country. Theres a big group of people that are in that category (of world leaders who dislike Obama) because Obama wants to focus on his golf game. He doesnt want to take the time necessary to get along with people. Its too bad. Wikileaks on Tuesday released a batch of hacked emails from the account of Clintons campaign manager, John Podesta, that shows her Democratic presidential campaign reacting after President Barack Obama said in a television interview that he learned of her private email server through news reports. Trumps response: Well, I now see why the president stuck up for Hillary, because he didnt want to be dragged into it... Because he knew all about her private server. This is a big thing. This means that he has to be investigated. Thousands of people are standing there to vote. I think those people are very, very disappointed that the leaders (of the Republican Party) arent helping us win. I know this: If the leaders were helping me, we couldnt lose this election. It would be an impossibility. The medias rigging the system. Its never been a pile on like this ... I mean, theyre rigging the polls. The polls are ridiculous. Look at that one poll that came out, ABC/Washington Post. That was a Democratic poll. Theyre rigging the system. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released on Sunday showed Clinton leading Trump by 12 percentage points among likely voters. ",politicsNews,"October 25, 2016 ",1
"Clinton warns against complacency, Trump warns of World War Three","COCONUT CREEK, Fla. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton warned her supporters on Tuesday against complacency as opinion polls show her holding a clear lead over Republican rival Donald Trump with two weeks left until the Nov. 8 election. Clinton told voters in Florida, one of the battleground states where the election will likely be decided, that Democrats could not afford to relax. I hope you will come out and vote because its going to be a close election. Pay no attention to the polls. Dont forget, dont get complacent, because weve got to turn people out, she told a rally in Coconut Creek, standing in front of a large sign reading: Vote Early.   Trump also campaigned in Florida on Tuesday. He blasted recent spikes in premiums for health insurance under President Barack Obamas Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Trump promised to repeal and replace the healthcare law as soon as he takes office. This is why we have to drain the swamp and repeal and replace Obamacare immediately, and Im the only candidate running for president who will do it, Trump said. On Monday, the U.S. government said the average premium for insurance plans sold on Healthcare.gov for 2017 rose by 25 percent compared with 2016. But with polls showing Trump trailing Clinton, Trump has asked his campaign to cut back on work identifying candidates for jobs in his future administration and focus instead on bolstering his chances on Nov. 8, according to two people familiar with the campaigns inner workings. An average of national polls on the RealClearPolitics website since mid-October gives Clinton a lead of more than 5 percentage points, as Trump fights off accusations that he groped women and faces heavy criticism for suggesting he might not accept the result of the election if he loses.             Trump denies the accusations of sexual misconduct and says the election is rigged against him, although he has not cited widely accepted evidence to back that up. On Tuesday, Trump told Reuters that Clintons plan for fixing the Syrian civil war would lead to World War Three, because of the potential for conflict with military forces from nuclear-armed Russia. In an interview focused largely on foreign policy, Trump said defeating Islamic State was a higher priority than persuading Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, playing down a long-held goal of U.S. policy. Clinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and safe zones on the ground in Syria to protect noncombatants.  Her campaign responded in a statement later on Tuesday noting that both Republican and Democratic national security experts had deemed Trump ill-prepared to be commander in chief, and accusing Trump of parroting Russian President Vladimir Putin and playing on Americans fears. Colin Powell, who served as Republican President George W. Bushs secretary of state and was chairman of the U.S. militarys joint chiefs of staff under his father, Republican President George Bush, said on Tuesday he would vote for Clinton.     The two candidates have sparred in recent days over the U.S.-backed Iraqi military push to take the northern Iraqi city of Mosul from Islamic State, which Trump described as a total disaster. Hes declaring defeat before the battle has even started, Clinton, who was secretary of state during Obamas first term, said on Tuesday.    She urged supporters to participate in early voting, which began this week in Florida. Nobody should want to wake up on Nov. 9 and wonder whether there was more you could have done, Clinton said. Clinton also appeared on Tuesday at the Univision studio in Doral, Florida, on El Gordo y La Flaca (The Fat Man and the Skinny Woman), a long-running entertainment show aimed at Latinos. The appearance underscored the importance of Latino voters in the battle for Floridas 29 electoral votes. Clinton maintained a commanding lead in the race to secure the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House, according to Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project results released on Saturday.

Exclusive: U.S. House to vote on Iran Sanctions Act renewal as soon as November,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives plan a vote as soon as mid-November on a 10-year reauthorization of the Iran Sanctions Act, congressional aides told Reuters on Tuesday, setting up a potential showdown with the White House and Senate. The Iran Sanctions Act, or ISA, which expires on Dec. 31, allows trade, energy, defense and banking industry sanctions over Irans nuclear program and ballistic missile tests.  Its fate is one of the major pieces of unfinished business facing lawmakers when they return to Washington on Nov. 14 for the first time after the Nov. 8 elections. U.S. Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is expected to introduce the 10-year renewal as soon as Congress gets back, aides said. Congressional aides said a clean renewal, meaning unchanged from the current legislation, was likely to pass the House. Its fate in the Senate was much less certain, and a White House spokesman would not say whether President Barack Obama would sign it into law. Republicans control majorities in both the House and Senate, and every Republican in Congress opposed the international nuclear deal announced in July 2015, in which Iran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for relief from crippling economic sanctions. Republicans have since tried repeatedly to pass legislation to clamp down on Iran, accusing Obama of being so eager to burnish his foreign policy legacy that he conceded too much to Tehran in the nuclear talks. Some Senate Republicans want more than a clean renewal of the ISA. They are trying to build support for legislation that would renew it but also do more to punish individual Iranians and businesses over the countrys ballistic missile tests and what they see as its support for terrorism. Some senators have also pushed for a law that would eliminate the presidents right to waive sanctions for security reasons. Obamas administration had asked Congress to hold off on renewing the ISA, saying it has enough power to reimpose economic sanctions if Iran violates the nuclear agreement even if it expires. White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to say how Obama would respond to the bill if it passed both houses of Congress and reached his desk. I wont prejudge at this point whether or not the president would sign that bill, Earnest told reporters traveling with the president in Los Angeles. The president and the Treasury Department retain significant sanctions authority that already has been used to impose costs on Iran for their flagrant violation of their international obligations, he said.  White House opposition to the bill could generate resistance from Democrats in the Senate, making it more difficult for any legislation to garner the 60 votes needed to move ahead. Because Republicans hold only 54 seats in the 100-member chamber, they would need Democratic support to move any bill. Renewing the sanctions bill could also increase frustrations in Iran. Iranian officials have been complaining for months that remaining U.S. sanctions have frightened away trade partners and robbed it of too many benefits it was promised under the nuclear deal. A House Foreign Affairs Committee aide said addressing the ISA before it expires is a top priority for Royce. The Iran Sanctions Act was enacted to curb Tehrans support for terrorism and its very dangerous weapons proliferation. It should remain in place until the regime stops exporting terror and threatening us and our allies with deadly weapons, Royce said in a statement sent to Reuters. Thats why Ill be introducing a bipartisan, long-term extension of these important sanctions, he said. ",politicsNews,"October 25, 2016 ",1
White House weighing whether greenhouse gas deal needs Senate approval,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Obama administration is evaluating whether an international agreement reached earlier this month to cut back on greenhouse gases used in refrigerators and air conditioners will need approval by the U.S. Senate, the White House said on Tuesday. Nearly 200 countries, including the United States and China, signed on to a deal in Kigali, Rwanda that would reduce the use of factory-made hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) gases. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said it is unclear whether the accord, which is an amendment to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, would need to be ratified by the U.S. Senate. The 1987 Montreal Protocol succeeded in phasing out the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), widely used at that time in refrigeration and aerosols.     There has been an ongoing analysis of the agreement to determine precisely what role Congress may have to play in ensuring that the United States can keep the commitments that were made in the context of that agreement, Earnest told reporters traveling with President Barack Obama at a fundraiser in Los Angeles. Obama believes the agreement would serve the national interest of the United States by helping to curb the impact of climate change and by bolstering U.S. companies that develop alternatives to HFCs, Earnest said. He noted that any vote on the agreement would likely take place after Obama leaves office in January. There will be a very strong case to make to the Senate about why they should approve this agreement, if in fact their approval is necessary, he said.",politicsNews,"October 25, 2016 ",1
"Trump asks team to trim back transition efforts, focus on race: sources","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Trailing in opinion polls, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has asked his campaign to cut back on work identifying candidates for key jobs in his would-be administration and focus instead on bolstering his chances on Election Day, according to two people familiar with the campaigns inner workings. After months of bitter battling, Trumps Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has a commanding lead in the race to win the Electoral College and claim the U.S. presidency on Nov. 8, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project results released on Saturday, which mirror other national polls.  People working on Trumps White House transition, which is led by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, have been asked by Trump to narrow down those efforts and refocus on the race, the sources, who asked not to be identified, said Tuesday. They have, as a result, largely set aside efforts to identify candidates for key Cabinet positions, but are continuing work to fill lower-level jobs, such as Securities and Exchange Commission general counsel, that would allow Trump to begin basic work on his agenda if he won on Nov. 8, without worrying about winning political battles first. Members of the transition team are also avoiding providing Trump with updates on the transition work to allow him and the campaign to focus the core of its efforts on improving his chances of winning the election, the sources said. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The sources did not say when Trump asked his campaign to reduce its transition work. But one of the two sources said that Christie has spent twice as much time helping Trump prepare for the three presidential debates, which occurred between Sept. 26 and Oct. 19, as he had on the transition work. A spokesman for Christie declined to comment. A third source familiar with the campaign, who also asked not to be named, said a senior Trump official has been contacting Wall Street tycoons and other wealthy Republicans for recommendations on lower-level positions.  That source said the Trump team has opened up its hiring search far beyond his core group of supporters and is even willing to consider people who have criticized the brash New York businessman.

White House urges ban on non-compete agreements for many workers,"(Reuters) - The Obama administration on Tuesday called on U.S. states to ban agreements prohibiting many workers from moving to their employers rivals, saying it would lead to a more competitive labor market and faster wage growth.  The administration said so-called non-compete agreements interfere with worker mobility and states should consider barring companies from requiring low-wage workers and other employees who are not privy to trade secrets or other special circumstances to sign them. Vice President Joe Biden in a statement said he had heard from a teacher in Nebraska who was barred from taking a summer job selling pet food to earn extra money. Among others, Biden also mentioned a salesman in Connecticut who was laid off and forced to spend his retirement savings because he was prohibited from accepting other sales jobs. (Workers) cant reach their true potential without freedom to negotiate for a higher wage with a new company, or to find another job after theyve been laid off, Biden said.  Nearly every state allows non-compete agreements, and legal battles over their validity are common. Courts in determining whether the agreements are lawful generally focus on the length of time they are in effect, their geographical limits and whether employees had access to trade secrets.  The issue drew attention from some lawmakers and advocacy groups in June when the attorney general of Illinois filed a lawsuit claiming non-compete agreements signed by employees of fast-food franchise Jimmy Johns were unlawful. The company said it would stop using the agreements in order to settle the case.  The Obama administration on Tuesday also urged states to ban non-compete agreements that are not proposed before a job offer or promotion is accepted and said employers should not be able to enforce the agreements when workers are laid off.  The White House said 20 percent of U.S. workers are bound by non-compete agreements, including 14 percent of those earning less than $40,000 per year.  But many businesses have legitimate reasons for requiring workers to sign the agreements, and states should not simply ban them for wide swaths of the work force, Beth Milito, senior legal counsel at the National Federation of Independent Business, said in an interview on Tuesday.  There need to be individualized assessments of the agreements that consider the industry and the geographical location, she said. ",politicsNews,"October 25, 2016 ",1
Yahoo scanning order unlikely to be made public: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Obama administration officials briefed key congressional staffers last week about a secret court order to Yahoo Inc YHOO.O that prompted it to search all users incoming emails for a still undisclosed digital signature, but they remain reluctant to discuss the unusual case with a broader audience. Executive branch officials spoke to staff for members of the Senate and House of Representatives committees overseeing intelligence operations and the judiciary, according to people briefed on the events, which followed Reuters disclosure of the massive search.[nL2N1C601L] But attempts by other members of Congress and civil society groups to learn more about the Yahoo order are unlikely to meet with success anytime soon, because its details remain a sensitive national security matter, U.S. officials told Reuters. Release of any declassified version of the order is unlikely in the foreseeable future, the officials said. The decision to keep details of the order secret comes amid mounting pressure on the U.S. government to be more transparent about its data-collection activities ahead of a congressional deadline next year to reauthorize some foreign intelligence authorities. On Tuesday, more than 30 advocacy groups will send a letter to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper asking for declassification of the Yahoo order that led to the search of emails last year in pursuit of data matching a specific digital symbol. We believe such a massive scan of the emails of millions of people, particularly if it involves the scanning of email content, could violate (the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act), the Fourth Amendment, and international human rights law, the coalition wrote in an advance draft of the letter that was shared with Reuters.  The Center for Democracy & Technology, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Brennan Center, Human Rights Watch and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers are among the signatories. The groups say that Title I of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, under which sources said the order was issued, requires a finding that the target of such a wiretap is probably an agent of a foreign power and that the facility to be tapped is probably going to be used for a transmission. An entire service, such as Yahoo, has never publicly been considered to be a facility in such a case: instead, the word usually refers to a phone number or an email account. The groups also pressed Clapper, who has pledged to be more transparent in the wake of controversial spying revelations, to explain how much authority the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has to order technical assistance from technology companies. Reuters reported that Yahoo had installed a special program that was hidden inside a Linux kernel module on its mail servers, where security staffers found it. Representative Justin Amash, who does not sit on one of the relevant committees, recently asked that all of Congress be briefed, given the significance of any change in interpreting foreign intelligence laws.  The briefing should involve all members, because all members will within about a year have to vote on a significant part of FISA, said Greg Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy & Technology, which circulated Tuesdays letter among free speech and privacy advocates. They should know what occurred so that they can decide whether to outlaw it.  Also last week, Yahoo itself asked Clapper to declassify the secret order or at least describe it, so that the company could respond to news reports and criticism that it did not do more to protect its users communications.  The American Civil Liberties Union meanwhile filed a motion in the surveillance court asking that the Yahoo order and other significant ruling going back a decade be unsealed.

Former Secretary of State Powell will vote for Clinton: Newsday,"(Reuters) - Colin Powell, who served as secretary of state in Republican President George W. Bushs administration, said on Tuesday he would vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election, according to Newsday newspaper. Powell, who made the announcement at an event hosted by a Long Island business group in Woodbury, New York, said Republican Donald Trump was not qualified and had sold Americans a bill of goods that he could not deliver, Newsday said. He has insulted America in one way almost every day, Powell said of Trump, according to the newspaper. He has insulted Latino Americans. He has insulted African-Americans. He has insulted women. He has insulted his own party. He has insulted our allies around the world one by one. He has insulted veterans, Powell said. He praised Clinton and said he considered the Democratic nominee a friend whom he had known for 20 years. She is smart. She is capable. She was a good secretary of state, Powell said, according to Newsday. She is balanced, she has temperament and no matter what anyone says she has stamina ... I think she is fully qualified to serve as the president of the United States and will serve it with distinction, Powell was quoted as saying by Newsday. In hacked emails leaked in September by a group U.S. intelligence officials suspect is linked to Russia, Powell referred to Trump as a national disgrace and said Clinton was greedy and had unbridled ambition.

U.S. says troubled by reports of another U.S. citizen jailed by Iran,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is troubled by reports that an Iranian-American man may have been sentenced by Iran to 18 years in prison, a State Department spokesman said on Tuesday, a week after an Iranian-American businessman and his father were also jailed by an Iranian court.  We are troubled by reports that Robin Reza Shahini, a person reported to be a U.S. citizen, may have been convicted and sentenced to 18 years in prison, spokesman John Kirby told a daily briefing. He called on Tehran to halt arbitrary and politically motivated detentions. California-based Shahini was detained while visiting his mother in Gorgan in July, according to Shahinis friends.  Last week, businessman Siamak Namazi and his 80-year-old father Baquer Namazi, a former Iranian provincial governor and former UNICEF official, were sentenced to 10 years in prison on charges of cooperating with the United States. Iran does not recognize dual nationality, which prevents Western embassies from visiting such detainees. Washington secured the release of five U.S. citizens from Iran in January in a prisoner exchange and has said it raises the detention of other Americans held by Tehran during meetings with Iranian officials. Major world powers, including the United States, reached a landmark nuclear deal with Iran in July last year, which lifted some international sanctions against Iran.  Nobody is turning a blind eye here, but what is behind this, I dont think any of us know with certainty, Kirby said, when asked why Iran keeps detaining dual citizens. I cant speak to the motivation behind these detentions but if one of the motivations was to secure ransom, it is a false perception. It is wrong. Republican leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives plan a vote as soon as mid-November on a 10-year reauthorization of the Iran Sanctions Act, congressional aides told Reuters. The move could increase frustrations in Iran, which has been complaining for months that remaining U.S. sanctions have frightened away trade partners. ",politicsNews,"October 25, 2016 ",1
"On the ballot: two clashing visions of how America will power its cars, homes","(Reuters) - Forget the accusations of groping, bigotry and email mismanagement. If the American voter had to choose between Republican nominee Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton based on their energy policies alone, the presidential election would still be a remarkable drama, amounting to the biggest referendum on global climate change since the term was coined. How the country decides on Nov. 8 will have far-reaching implications for the price of electricity and gas at the pump, as well as the future of the U.S. energy industry, which employs about 10 million people. Trumps vision is an America where oil derricks pump furiously again, coal miners get back to work, and the country puts its own economy ahead of foreign nations worried about the effects of fossil fuels on sea levels, droughts, and storms. Clinton sees an America where half a billion solar panels power homes, cars run on electricity, oil use is cut by a third, and the clean energy sector provides a deep well of new jobs supported by government mandates and subsidies.  At a very basic level, it would be a climate vote, said Sarah Emerson, the head of Energy Security Analysis Inc in Boston. Do you want fossil fuels, or renewables? Trump has said he wants to unleash a U.S. energy revolution by streamlining environmental regulation, easing infrastructure permitting and pulling the country out of a global pact to combat climate change  moves he says would promote increased oil and gas drilling and revive the dying coal mining industry without compromising air and water quality. The proposals align neatly with both the Republican Partys opposition to government overreach, and Trumps own campaign theme of making America Great Again by restoring traditional industries, including many that have been hurt by international trade agreements. While the plan has earned him some support within an oil and gas industry naturally opposed to regulation, it has also given rise to skepticism among even his closest allies over whether he can deliver. Obama hasnt shut down drilling  what has shut down drilling is price, Texas oil billionaire T. Boone Pickens, a Trump supporter, told Reuters. I dont know what Trump can do to help the industry. A technology-driven drilling boom has pushed U.S. oil and gas production up 70 percent since President Barack Obama took office in 2008, making America the top producer in the world, but it has also triggered a slump in prices as demand has failed to keep up. Oil prices are running at four-month highs around $50 a barrel after the OPEC cartel signaled in September it may make its first production cut in eight years, but prices remain less than half their levels from mid-2014.  While the price crash has been a boon for consumers and energy-intensive businesses, dozens of energy companies have gone bankrupt, putting blue collar workers in the coal mines, shale fields and oil rigs out of work.  Critics have said Trumps plan to revive natural gas drilling would finish off the very coal industry he promises to restore, because the two fuels compete. It would seem to defy basic market laws of supply and demand, said Jason Bordoff, a former energy adviser to Obama. The coal industry, once a large employer in parts of America, now employs less than 60,000 miners. It has become a symbol of Trumps vow to revive dying industries. Clinton suffered political damage when she said were going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business. Trumps energy plan would also force the United States to make an abrupt turnabout on the environment: He wants to withdraw from the global climate change pact agreed in Paris last year.  He has called climate change a hoax and has argued the Paris deal would cost the U.S. economy trillions of dollars and put it at a disadvantage.  Trump wants to rescind the Clean Power Plan to limit carbon output and downgrade the Environmental Protection Agency to a commission, not a cabinet level agency, and refocus it on its core mission: clean air and clean water for all Americans, regardless of race or income. An oil industry lobbyist in Washington D.C., who asked not to be named, said that even if Trumps policies were unlikely to solve the root problem facing the industry right now  the low price of oil and gas  his ideas were still mainly welcomed. Regulation is a killer, and if it can be streamlined, it helps, he said. Trumps campaign has drawn about $99,000 from employees of the oil and gas industry since July, when he was formally nominated, while Clinton has received about $114,000 from the industry over the same period, according to the latest federal campaign finance disclosures. Environmental advocates argue that a failure to agree on strong measures like the Paris accord would doom the world to ever-hotter average temperatures, bringing with them deadlier storms, more frequent droughts and rising sea levels as polar ice caps melt. Clinton says she wants to address that by making America a clean energy superpower. Her plan calls for phasing out fossil fuels, embracing clean energy sources like solar and wind, strengthening environmental protections and leading the world in curbing carbon dioxide emissions blamed for climate change. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. Thats a lot of jobs. Thats a lot of new economic activity, Clinton said in the first presidential debate in September. Solar development is aided by a federal tax credit worth 30 percent of the cost of a system. That credit was set to expire at the end of this year, but received a five-year extension from Congress in late 2015. Even so, the cost of electricity from large-scale solar installations has dropped to a level that is now comparable to natural gas-fired power, even without incentives. Clinton has also signaled increased regulation of fracking to prevent water and air pollution, continued support for the Obama administrations efforts to curb carbon output that would pressure fuels like coal, and a tougher approach to infrastructure permitting. Her approach appears much more likely than Trumps to lift consumer prices for gasoline, heating oil, and electricity, given that increased regulation typically increases costs of production, many analysts said.  Still, Clinton will likely face stiff resistance from U.S. Congress - if Republicans retain control of one or both houses. She could follow in Obamas footsteps by relying on executive orders to implement her agenda, but opponents would almost certainly challenge her in the courts. Jay Faison, a North Carolina entrepreneur who calls himself a conservative advocate for clean energy, agrees with the need for more lower-carbon sources of energy, but says Trumps plans to cut regulation could provide a more effective way to get there. They could potentially make it easier to build nuclear power plants and hydro-electric dams, which produce no carbon dioxide, for example. Environmentalists, who have helped mobilize mass protests against energy infrastructure projects during Obamas presidency, hate Trumps proposals. But they are also suspicious of Clinton. She promoted fracking technology to European allies while Americas top diplomat to help them reduce their dependence on Russia, according to leaked diplomatic cables, and was slow to oppose the Keystone XL pipeline proposal that would have piped in more oil sands from Alberta to U.S. refineries. Its a shame that were going to have to spend four or eight years pressuring her at every turn but we will, said Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org, which advocates a complete halt to fossil fuels development.

Clinton slams Trump for comments on offensive against Islamic State,"MANCHESTER, N.H./ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton slammed rival Donald Trump on Monday for saying that the week-old effort to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul from the control of Islamic State was going badly. Hes basically declaring defeat before the battle has even started, Clinton said at a campaign event in New Hampshire. Hes proving to the world what it means to have an unqualified commander in chief. In a tweet on Sunday, Trump, the Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election, said the attack on Mosul is turning out to be a total disaster. We gave them months of notice. U.S. is looking so dumb. Iraqi and Kurdish forces, backed by the United States, have mounted a huge assault on the area surrounding the city, the last stronghold of Islamic State forces in Iraq. They have  retaken about 80 Islamic State-held villages and towns since the offensive was launched on Oct. 16, but have yet to move on the city itself. Trump reiterated his position during a rally on Monday in St. Augustine, Florida, where he also urged supporters to vote early and declared his campaign was winning the election. So now were bogged down in Mosul. The enemy is much tougher than they thought. Theyve had a lot of time to get ready, Trump said. Its a horrible, horrible situation thats going on. Why did we have to tell them were going in?  The operation could last weeks, or even months. Islamic State mounted counterattacks on Monday across the country against the Iraqi army and Kurdish forces, trying to deflect attention away from the Mosul campaign. Trump suggested last week during the final 2016 presidential debate that the U.S.-backed attack on Mosul was orchestrated to help Clinton in her White House bid.  With just over two weeks to go until the election, Clinton, President Barack Obamas first-term secretary of state, leads the New York businessman in national opinion polls. Both candidates have been focusing on a small set of political swing states that could decide the contest. Seeking to cement a wide advantage she holds with women voters, Clinton enlisted the help of firebrand U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who blasted Trump over allegations he tried to grope or kiss several women without their consent over a 20-year span.  He thinks that because he has a mouthful of Tic Tacs that he can force himself on any woman within groping distance, Warren told a raucous crowd of 4,000 at St. Anselm College in Manchester. Well, Ive got news for you, Donald Trump. Women have had it with guys like you. At least 10 women have said Trump made unwanted sexual advances, including groping or kissing, in incidents from the early 1980s to 2007, according to reports in various news outlets. Trump has denied the womens allegations, calling them totally and absolutely false and promising on Saturday he would sue his accusers.  Warrens mention of Tic Tac mint candies referred to a moment in a 2005 video that surfaced earlier this month in which Trump was heard boasting about groping and kissing women. Warren also referred to Trump calling Clinton a nasty woman at last weeks debate, a phrase that quickly caught fire on social media, sparking hashtags and T-shirts. Get this, Donald, nasty women are tough, Warren said. Nasty women are smart. And nasty women vote. And on Nov. 8 we nasty women are gonna march our nasty feet to cast our nasty votes to get you out of our lives forever. Clinton praised Warren for taking the fight to Trump. She gets under his (Trumps) thin skin like nobody else, the candidate said. Warren is one of a handful of high-profile surrogate campaigners helping Clinton in the final weeks of the race. In California, Obama raised money for his former top diplomat and joked on the Jimmy Kimmel Live show that he laughed most of the time when he saw Trump on television. Trump spent the day campaigning in Florida, a critical swing state. At an event in Tampa, he criticized Clintons position on Syria. If you look at her plans for Syria, these are the plans of a child. These are the plans of someone who doesnt know what theyre doing, he said. At an earlier event for farmers in Boynton Beach, Trump disputed multiple national and state polls that show him lagging Clinton and accused the media of distorting poll results to discourage his supporters from voting.  I believe were actually winning, Trump said.  Just the day before, Trumps campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, acknowledged that the candidate was trailing in the race, saying in a TV interview: We are behind. The former first lady is working to turn out her supporters in states such as Ohio, where singer Jay Z plans to hold a concert in support of her candidacy, the Clinton campaign said.  According to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project, which surveys the vote in battleground states, Clinton leads Trump in most of the states that Trump would need to win to have a chance of amassing the 270 Electoral College votes needed to capture the White House.  According to the survey, she had a better than 95 percent chance of winning, had the election been held last week. The mostly likely outcome would be 326 votes for Clinton to 212 for Trump. The Electoral College votes represent a tally of wins from the states. ",politicsNews,"October 23, 2016 ",1
Must see TV: why gutting NAFTA unlikely to create U.S. jobs,"CUIDAD JUAREZ, MEXICO (Reuters) - Both U.S. presidential candidates routinely criticize free-trade deals they blame for the loss of American jobs. But tweaking the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as Hillary Clinton has pledged to do, or ripping it up, as Donald Trump demands, may do nothing to help companies like Element Electronics Corp, which owns Americas last television factory.  Winnsboro, South Carolina-based Element, and the television industry more broadly, offer a window into the complexity of industrial supply chains and illustrate why pushing manufacturing jobs back to the United States is so difficult. Elements plant in South Carolina is nearly identical to a rival factory operated by Taiwanese conglomerate Tatung Company that sits on a dusty back street in this Mexican border town. Both import nearly all their components from Asia. The parts often flow in through the same southern California ports. But there's a big, and costly, difference. The Mexican plant, by sitting just over the border from El Paso, Texas, doesn't have to pay duty on those parts, even when the finished televisions are sold in the United States. But Element's factory has to foot the tariff bill, which makes its televisions more expensive. (For a graphic on the trade loophole, click tmsnrt.rs/2ep5QMy ) Its pretty crazy that Im disadvantaged for using U.S. labor, says Michael OShaughnessy, Elements president. Thats a sentiment that Trump, the Republican nominee, has forcefully tapped as he makes the case that radically revamping the trade deal would level the playing field and bring jobs back. Many trade experts, though, say it would be a costly disaster to try to unravel these production networks, which essentially treat Mexico as a 51st state.  The Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank that favors free trade, released a study last month that predicted imposing stiff tariffs on Mexico and China would disrupt North American producers that have created global supply chains and push the United States into a recession. The TV industry is characterized by particularly dense webs of cross-border supply chains with Mexico and China, says Marcus Noland, the economist who directed the study. Thered be chaos and a trade war. Even many who oppose NAFTA acknowledge it would be disruptive to suddenly erect barriers, given the way companies have shifted supply chains to integrate Mexico. NAFTA, implemented in 1994, forged a common market between the United States, Mexico and Canada. In response, many industries, including television manufactures, have transformed themselves by creating supply chains that crisscross the border.  Televisions once were produced in the United States and elsewhere with hundreds of parts, often tucked into elaborate wooden cases. A modern flat screen, by contrast, has relatively few parts, and more than 70 percent of its value is packed into the glass and the electronics integrated directly into the panel. The heart of the industry, including that core glass technology and production, is now based in Asia. About half of all TVs imported to the U.S. come from Mexico, says Paul Gagnon, an expert on the industrys supply chain at IHS Markit, an economic research firm.  The main reason for that is so the producers can respond quickly to fluctuations in demand, he says. TV sales are highly seasonal, spiking late in the year. In Mexico, some of the factories double their workforce for just a few months to respond to this. Gagnon doubts the jobs would come back to the United States, because margins on TVs are so low. If there were any major cost increase (in Mexico), youd probably see some shift to Asia for production  rather than seeing that production happen in the U.S. Some Mexican plants mold the plastic casing and do other tasks in the assembly process. But in many cases  including at both the Element and Tatung plants  the assembly plants do mostly finishing touches like inserting printing circuit boards and tuning the units. This creates relatively few jobs compared to the kind of television manufacturing done in the U.S. industrys heyday. In the 1950s, there were some 150 domestic television manufacturers in the United States, and employment peaked at about 100,000 in the 1960s. Mexicos cost advantage over the United State is formidable. OShaughnessy said he pays his 200 workers, who operate in a converted shirt factory, about $15 an hour. The pay at the Juarez plant is about $2.50 an hour. Even with this edge, its getting harder to do the work in Mexico, said Chan-hsing Diao, manager of the Tatung plant. (Tatung doesnt sell televisions under its own name, but rather is paid by other manufacturers to assemble their name-brand products.) The industry is consolidating and the cost pressures are enormous, he said, noting that over the last six years, the amount he is paid to assemble a 32-inch television has fallen by half, from about $6 a unit to $3 a unit. The profits are this, he said, holding up two fingers almost touching. The Tatung plant in Juarez occupies a cavernous space that was once a windshield factory. It now features long assembly lines for televisions and produced 15 million TVs over the last seven years, Diao said. Some 13 million of those were sold in the United States. In January, the company lost its main customer, a Chinese TV manufacturer that Diao declined to identify. Tatung is scrambling to find a new manufacturer that wants to build TVs for the United States. In the meantime, it continues assembling TVs for Mexico and some other Latin American markets. Diao warned there would be a trade war if a new U.S. administration tore up the NAFTA agreement. With profits already so tight in Mexico,many Chinese producers might find it easier to ship finished goods directly from Asia rather than move production and jobs to the United States, he said. OShaughnessy, for his part, said he just wants to get the same break on import duties as Mexico gets under NAFTA. His decision to build in the United States, he said, was driven entirely by his only customer for the U.S. plant, Wal-Mart, which uses Element as a centerpiece of its campaign to promote domestic manufacturing. The South Carolina TVs are shipped in boxes emblazoned with American flags and bearing the words Assembled in the USA. OShaughnessy has appealed for a tariff exemption from his local congressman, Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a Republican. Mulvaney said he is sympathetic but has been unable to win over many fellow lawmakers who consider special exemptions a form of earmarks for special interests, which many oppose on principle. Element makes clear the real world implications of these trade deals we have signed, said Mulvaney, adding that its time to review NAFTA to iron out this and other loopholes.    Back in Juarez, the annual ramp-up of hiring is under way at the Tatung plant to supply the surge of televisions bought over the holidays. Employment at Tatung goes as low as 280 each year, for instance, but is now on its way up to 600, Diao said. You could never do that in America  at least not easily, he says, referring to this cycle of hiring and firing large numbers.  ",politicsNews,"October 25, 2016 ",1
Kerry confident U.S. and Philippines can 'work through' Duterte confusion,"WASHINGTON/MANILA (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is confident after speaking to his Philippine counterpart that the two countries can work through a period of confusion caused by anti-American rhetoric from President Rodrigo Duterte, the State Department said on Monday. State Department spokesman John Kirby said Kerry expressed concern in his conversation on Sunday with Foreign Minister Perfecto Yasay about the tone of remarks by the Philippine president, who has sharply criticized President Barack Obama and talked of separation from Washington. At the same time, Kerry emphasized strong and stable ties between the longtime allies, while Kirby said Washington had seen no practical action by Manila to move away from those. Kerrys conversation with Yasay came after Duterte provoked alarm last week by announcing a separation from the United States and realignment with China during a visit to Beijing. Although Duterte said later he did not really mean separation, his remarks added to concerns about the future of a U.S.-Philippine military cooperation pact seen as crucial to projecting U.S. power in Asia in the face of fast-rising China. Earlier on Monday, the most senior U.S. diplomat for Asia,  Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Daniel Russel, said in Manila that Washington remained a trusted ally to the Philippines and supported its blossoming ties with China. Russel was the first high-level visitor from Washington since Dutertes remarks and Kirby said that both Russel and Kerry made clear the United States had every intention of continuing to meet its security commitments to the Philippines. The tone and tenor of the discussions that they had ... and the assurances that the Philippine side gave to their commitment to keeping the relationship going was enough to lead the secretary and the assistant secretary to believe that we were going to be able to work through this, Kirby told a regular news briefing.  In his comments to reporters, Russel said he had candidly told Yasay that Manilas friends were concerned about the high loss of life in Dutertes campaign against drugs and reiterated the importance of due process. Russel said a real climate of uncertainty about the Philippines intentions had created consternation in many countries, including the United States. He said that worry extended beyond governments to corporate boardrooms and warned that it was bad for business in a very competitive region. Since Duterte took office on June 30, he has been scathing about U.S. criticism of his anti-drug campaign, in which about 2,300 people have been killed. But his ministers have repeatedly sought to soften his more outspoken remarks. Explaining Dutertes Goodbye America remarks, Yasay said on Saturday the United States remained the closest friend of the Philippines but that Manila wanted to break away from a mindset of dependency and subservience and forge closer ties with other nations. Russel said Duterte himself had already walked back his remarks and added that Washington supported direct dialogue and negotiations between the Philippines and China. We dont want countries to have to choose between the U.S. and China, he said. ",politicsNews,"October 24, 2016 ",1
Obama trolls Trump over 'mean tweet' on late night TV," (This October 24 story has been refiled to say go instead of do in second paragraph) By Roberta Rampton LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Monday trolled Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump - known for his prolific use of Twitter to settle scores - making Trump the punch line for jokes on ABCs late-night show Jimmy Kimmel Live. Obama read aloud a series of mean tweets culminating in one from Trump: President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States! At least I will go down as a president, Obama said. Kimmel joked that Obama had to take time away from helping rig the election to appear on the show, a dig at Trump, who has repeatedly said the Nov. 8 vote is rigged against him. Obama picked up on the joke while describing how comedian Bill Murray beat him in a contest to putt golf balls into a glass in the Oval Office during a recent visit - a stunt the White House designed to promote Obamacare health insurance. He won repeatedly, Obama said. The glass was rigged! Kimmel asked Obama, Do you ever laugh when watching Trump on television. Most of the time, Obama said. Obama also revealed he has been called on a special phone by his bed three or four times in the middle of the night during his time in office to deal with emergencies, including when the 2011 tsunami hit Japan. But he said he does not reach for his smartphone in the wee hours - another dig at the Republican candidate. I dont tweet at 3 a.m. about people who insult me, Obama said. Obamas second and final term ends on Jan. 20. Under the U.S. constitution, presidents are limited to two terms - which is just as well, Obama said. If I were able to run for a third term, Michelle would divorce me, he said, noting his wife does not like politics. Not all the jokes were at Trumps expense. Comedian Will Farrell channeled deceased but beloved Chicago Cubs sportscaster Harry Caray to recommend that Obama open a shrimp shack after he leaves office. And Joel McHale feigned outrage when told he had been bumped from the show for Obama. You got the president, huh. Wow, thats a big deal - hes got two months left in the job, McHale said, oozing sarcasm. Thats a real good get there, Jimmy: Lame! Duck! McHale said. ",politicsNews,"October 25, 2016 ",1
U.S. government says benchmark 2017 Healthcare.gov premiums up 25 percent,"(Reuters) - The average premium for benchmark 2017 Obamacare insurance plans sold on Healthcare.gov rose 25 percent compared with 2016, the U.S. government said on Monday, the biggest increase since the insurance first went on sale in 2013 for the following year. The average monthly premium for the benchmark plan is rising to $302 from $242 in 2016, the Department of Health and Human Services said. The agency attributed the large increase to insurers adjusting their premiums to reflect two years of cost data that became available. The government provides income-based subsidies to about 85 percent of people enrolled, and those credits will increase with the higher premiums. It said 72 percent of consumers on HealthCare.gov will find plans with a premium of less than $75 per month. Large national insurers including Aetna Inc (AET.N), UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) and Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) have said they are losing money on the exchanges, created under President Barack Obamas national healthcare reform law, because patient costs are higher than anticipated and enrollment is lower than forecast. Both UnitedHealth and Aetna have pulled out of the exchanges for 2017. As a result, consumers will have fewer plans to choose from. In 2017, in five states there will be offerings from only one insurance company. The government expects average monthly 2017 enrollment of 11.4 million people, up about 1 million from 2016. Obama acknowledged last week that the law is not working perfectly but said the problems could be fixed if lawmakers created a government-run health insurance option that would help U.S. states where there is little or no competition. Premium increases have become fodder for the presidential race, as Republican candidate Donald Trump calls for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act if he is elected and Democrat Hillary Clinton calls for expanding it. The news shows why the entire program must be repealed and replaced .... Mr. Trump knows the only way to fix our nations failing health care system is complete and total reform, said Trump communications adviser Jason Miller. The government agency said the 2017 premium increase comes after two years of very low increases in the marketplace for the second-lowest cost silver plan, the benchmark plan used to calculate cost-sharing subsidies.  Average premiums for the silver plan increased 2 percent in 2015 and were up 7 percent in 2016, the agency said. The figure reflects premiums on Healthcare.gov, the federally run website that sells plans for about two-thirds of the states. Including four states and the District of Columbia, which run their own insurance marketplaces, and those that have reported data, the average premium rose 22 percent, the agency said.

Pennsylvania ex-attorney general gets jail time in leak case,"NORRISTOWN, Pa. (Reuters) - Former Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane was sentenced on Monday to serve 10 to 23 months in county jail for leaking confidential grand jury information and then lying about it to investigators. Kane, 50, the first woman and first Democrat ever elected Pennsylvania attorney general, was convicted in August on charges of perjury, false swearing, obstruction of justice, official oppression and conspiracy. She resigned two days after the jury in Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas handed down its verdict. In addition, Judge Wendy Demchick-Alloy sentenced Kane to eight years of probation. A lesser sentence will depreciate the seriousness of the crimes of this defendant, she said.  Kane, who intends to appeal her conviction, had faced a maximum sentence of 24 years in state prison. Her lawyer, Marc Steinberg, was not available to comment after the hearing. Kane was accused of giving information from a grand jury proceeding in 2013 to a Philadelphia Daily News reporter to retaliate against a former state prosecutor, Frank Fina. She believed he had told the Philadelphia Inquirer about her decision to drop prosecution of a case Fina had developed against six black Democratic legislators in Philadelphia. Grand juries play an important role in the U.S. criminal justice system by deciding if a prosecutor has enough evidence to bring charges against a suspect. Secret deliberations encourage witnesses to speak without fear of retaliation and to protect the reputation of suspects when the jury decides against recommending charges. Witnesses for the prosecution said the Kane investigation had brought havoc to the attorney generals office. Today is another sad day for the Commonwealth and its citizens, Bruce Beemer, who replaced Kane, said in a statement after the sentencing.  The Office of Attorney General is moving forward with steps to restore the publics confidence in the work that we do and the way that we do it, he said without specifying his offices plans. Kane is the second Pennsylvania attorney general in the past quarter-century to be convicted of crimes committed in office. In 1995, AttorneyGeneral Ernie Preate pleaded guilty to mail fraud and served a prison sentence. More than 25 friends and members of Kanes family attended the hearing to show support. Several, including Kanes son Christopher, 15, testified as character witnesses on her behalf. Frank DeAndrea, a former police chief of Hazleton, told the judge that sending Kane to prison could amount to a death sentence if drug lords she helped convict retaliate.  Demchick-Alloy said Kane had assumed that risk when she decided to commit crimes. ",politicsNews,"October 24, 2016 ",1
"In battleground Florida, tough stance on felons may sap votes for Democrats","TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (Reuters) - Leonard Roscoe Newton has been in and out of Floridas prisons since beforehe could vote, starting with a youthful conviction for burglary. Hes been a free man for six years now with an important exception: he still cant vote.  Newton, who is African American, is among nearly 1.5 million former felons who have been stripped of their right to vote in a state with a history of deciding U.S. presidential elections, sometimes by razor-thin margins of just a few hundred votes.  Felons have been disenfranchised in Florida since 1868, although they can seek clemency to restore their voting rights. Since 2011, however, when Republican state leaders toughened the restrictions on felon voting rights, just 2,339 ex-felons have had that right restored, the lowest annual numbers in nearly two decades, according to state data reviewed by Reuters. That compares with more than 155,000 in the prior four years under reforms introduced by Governor Rick Scotts predecessor, moderate Republican governor Charlie Crist, the data shows. Crist, who was governor from 2007 to 2011, made it much easier to restore ex-felons voting rights. When I tried to be an effective member of the community, I saw that I was voiceless, said Newton, whose expectations of getting his rights restored were dashed when the rules changed under a new administration. Im 45, and I have never voted. The dramatic slowdown has stoked a racially charged debate over whether political bias taints the process of restoring felon voting rights in the largest battleground state in the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Floridas toughened ban means racial minorities are disproportionately excluded from voting because of higher incarceration rates, data shows. Black voters tend to favor Democrats.  Republicans oppose the felon vote change because they are concerned about the political implications, said Darryl Paulson, a conservative Republican voting rights expert who sees wide restoration of voting rights as a huge political advantage for the Democratic Party. Paulson says non-violent ex-felons should have the right to vote. Almost all U.S. states deny incarcerated felons the right to vote but many restore those rights after they have completed their sentences. Over the last two decades, more than 20 states have taken action to help people with criminal convictions regain their voting rights. Since July, Virginias governor has restored voting rights to 67,000 felons. Florida is the largest of four remaining states that strip all former felons of voting rights, accounting for nearly half of those barred from voting nationally.Along with Virginia, the others are Kentucky and Iowa. In March 2011, two months after he became governor, Scott reversed Crists reforms, which had allowed many non-violent  felons to automatically get their voting rights reinstated after they had completed their sentences. Crist had also simplified the process for felons convicted of more serious crimes to regain their votes.  Scott, a millionaire former health care executive, put in place new restrictions, requiring ex-felons to wait for five to seven years before applying to regain the right to vote, serve on a jury or hold elected office. He said the new rules ensured ex-felons had proven they were unlikely to offend. Florida has disenfranchised about one in five voting-age black voters, according to research collected by the Sentencing Project, a Washington-based advocacy group. That compares with about 8.6 percent of the states non-black potential voters. Data on the Hispanic voting-age population who cant vote because of the law was unavailable, although Hispanics make up 12.5 percent of Floridas inmates. The rates reflect racial disparities in criminal convictions. Floridas current prison population is nearly 48 percent black, more than any other racial group, although blacks are only 17 percent of the states population. Ion Sancho, supervisor of elections in Leon County, which includes the capital city of Tallahassee, accused the Republican administration of repealing the felon voting reforms to reduce the number of African Americans who had their rights restored because those voters were perceived to be more Democratic voting and so therefore were targeted for elimination. Sancho is a former Democrat who is now unaffiliated with either party. Scott andAttorney General Pam Bondi,the Republican officials who drove the 2011 policy changes, did not agree to be interviewed by Reuters or respond directly to questions on the accusations that the law is intended to influence elections. But Bondi has previously denied the policy amounts to racially motivated disenfranchisement. For those who may suggest that these rule changes have anything to do with race, these assertions are completely unfounded. Justice has nothing to do with race, Bondi wrote in a 2011 newspaper editorial. Scotts office, in a statement to Reuters, said former felons need to demonstrate that they can live a life free of crime, show a willingness to request to have their rights restored and show restitution to the victims of their crimes in order to have their voting rights restored. Democrats have seized on the issue as a civil rights concern, regardless of the political impact, said Nell Toensmann, who chairs the Democratic Party of St. Johns County,a north Florida region of about 225,000 people dominated by Republicans. Yes, it does disenfranchise a lot of African Americans, but it disenfranchises a lot of white people who would be voting as Republicans as well, she said. The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation polling project shows a tight race in Florida. It estimates that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has a 48 percent chance of winning the state, compared to her Republican opponent Donald Trumps 42 percent. Political scientists say the voting ban can sap votes from both parties,but some research suggests that Democrats pay a steeper price. An analysis of voting patterns by race and economic status found that if the ban had not existed during the 2000 presidential election, Democrats would have had enough votes to overturn Republican George W. Bushs 537-vote victory in Florida that won him the White House. In very close elections won by Republican candidates, felon disenfranchisementcould be decisive, said Christopher Uggen, a University of Minnesota professor who led the study. Applying for voting rights can be difficult. Ex-felons must submit certified court documentation of each felony conviction  documents that can be difficult to secure for those unable to spend time and money tracking down records in courthouses. Cases involving serious crimes are heard in person by a clemency board consisting of the governor and Floridascabinet officers, in quarterly meetings in Tallahassee. During a Sept. 21 meeting in a windowless room in the Florida Capitol building, 48 petitions to restore voting rights were on the agenda presented to the governor and three state officers in an all-day session punctuated by tears and emotional pleas. Some petitioners were represented by attorneys, others showed up solo or accompanied by a friend or relative. Clemency is an act of mercy. There is no right or guarantee, Scott told them, urging applicants to accept culpability. State rules give him the deciding vote. If I deny, its over, he said. Learlean Rahming approached the podium in a black and white flowered dress, accompanied by her adult daughter. State records show dozens of criminal charges over two decades that include larceny, drug possession and shoplifting. I accept my responsibility for all of my stupid mistakes of the past, said the 63-year-old woman, who had traveled from Miami, adding that she has been out of prison for more than 20 years. Officials were impressed by her turnaround story, until Bondi noticed a discrepancy. Records showed Rahming had voted under a married name after her release. Just to see if I could vote, she told the panel, explaining that for many years she had not realized that her rights were taken away. Scott moved to deny. Rahming left, wiping tears. The board ultimately cleared 23 residents to get back their civil rights. More than 10,500 applications are still pending. Crist, the former governor who championed leniency, switched to the Democratic Party in 2012. In an interview, he questioned whether the policy changes on felons voting cost him a 2014 bid to reclaim the governors mansion. He lost by about 64,000 votes - in the ballpark of the number of people in thestate who complete felony sentences in a typical year, Florida Department of Corrections data shows. We will never know for sure, Crist said. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Felons face tougher road to Election Day    tmsnrt.rs/2dsol2q) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> ",politicsNews,"October 24, 2016 ",1
Negative tone of White House race sours young voters,"BOSTON (Reuters) - The exceptionally negative tone of this years race for the White House is souring young Americans, turning some away from the democratic process just as the millennial generation has become as large a potential bloc of voters as the baby boomers. Reuters/Ipsos polling shows that Americans aged 18 to 34 are slightly less likely to vote for president this year than their comparably aged peers were in 2012. Some political scientists worry that this election could scar a generation of voters, making them less likely to cast ballots in the future. Young Americans on the left and right have found reasons to be dissatisfied with their choices this year. Senator Bernie Sanders had an enthusiastic following of younger people before he lost the Democratic primary race to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. On the Republican side, some are unwilling to vote for Donald Trump, citing the New York businessmans sometimes insulting rhetoric on women, minorities and immigrants. Brandon Epstein, who turned 18 on Monday, had looked forward earlier in the year to casting his first vote for Sanders. Now, the resident of suburban Suffolk County, New York, plans to sit out the vote on Election Day, Nov. 8. Its because of the selection of the candidates. I find them to be not just sub-par, but unusually sub-par, said Epstein, a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Somethings gone terribly wrong. That sentiment is broadly reflected in poll data that show that young Americans are less enthusiastic about their choices in November than they were four years ago when Democratic President Barack Obama faced a re-election challenge from Republican Mitt Romney. Some 52.2 percent of respondents aged 18 to 34 told Reuters/Ipsos they were certain or almost certain to vote, compared with 56.1 percent who reported that level of certainty at the same point in 2012. The national tracking poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It included 3,088 people between 18-34 years old who took the survey from Oct. 1 to Oct. 17, and 2,141 18-34 year olds who took the poll on the same days in 2012. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points for both groups. For at least the past half century, young Americans have voted at lower rates than their elders. But this years decline in enthusiasm is of particular concern because it comes as the millennial generation - people born from 1981 through 1997 - has become as large a bloc of eligible voters as the baby boomers - born between 1946 and 1964. Each groups number of eligible voters is approaching 70 million people, according to the Pew Research Center. This generation has never trusted the government, Wall Street or the media less, John Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard Universitys Institute of Politics, said of the millennials. Thats likely to result in turnout of less than 50 percent and of those who do turn out, there is still a deep cynicism regarding the impact of their vote, whether or not it will make a difference. The projected low turnout is a particular concern given recent research showing how important habit is in encouraging voter participation. Put simply, a person who votes in one election is about 10 percent more likely to vote in the next than an eligible voter who opted to stay home, said Alexander Coppock, an assistant professor of political science at Yale University. If you extend that logic, if you have an election that fails to turn people on to voting, youd expect that you wouldnt get that cumulative effect, said Coppock, whose article Is Voting Habit Forming? was published in this months issue of the American Journal for Political Science. However, not all young voters unhappy with their choices will be staying home. Some plan to cast a ballot anyway, even if only in protest, rather than sitting out. That group includes Cameron Khansarinia, a 20-year-old vice president of the Harvard Republican Club, who said he would cast a ballot even though he opposed Trump. I will definitely vote, I just dont know if I will be writing someone in or voting for (Libertarian) Gary Johnson or even voting for Hillary Clinton when it gets down to it, said Khansarinia, who is registered to vote in heavily Democratic California. Once this is over, come Nov. 9, we will need people here to rebuild the party. ",politicsNews,"October 24, 2016 ",1
Oil industry workers split between Trump and Clinton,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas industry workers have contributed only slightly more money to the campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton than to Republican Donald Trump since the two clinched their parties nominations for the White House, according to Reuters review of federal disclosures. The nearly even support suggests ambivalence in the industry between two rivals who have put forward wildly different energy visions. Trump calls for a drastic reduction in regulations to bolster drilling, while Clinton advocates tougher environmental protections and more renewables. Employees in the industry gave Clinton $114,141 and Trump $99,302 since July 1, Reuters found in reviewing individual campaign contributions exceeding $200 and donations funneled through their joint fundraising committees. Both were officially nominated by their parties in mid-July. Several oil and gas industry employees reached by Reuters said they did not donate just because of the candidates energy policies. Most requested anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the election. I am moved by the disturbing nature of what I see in Trumps vision for America on trade, the economy and national security, said American Gas Association head Dave McCurdy, who has contributed to Clintons campaign. He added, however, that he agreed with Clinton on reducing carbon dioxide emissions blamed for climate change and felt natural gas would play a role in that effort. The association has not endorsed a candidate. Continental Resources Inc Chief Executive Officer Harold Hamm, who has contributed repeatedly to Trumps campaign, has argued in favor of the candidates energy policies. Hamm has said bolstering U.S. drilling would reduce dependence on Middle East oil, whose proceeds he says finance terrorist attacks. A Continental official did not respond to a request for comment from Hamm. An energy lobbyist based in Washington said he understood the industrys ambivalence. Clinton is pro-regulation, which hurts, he said, requesting anonymity. And Trump has no record in the industry, so theres no evidence he understands the issues.  Clinton had far exceeded Trump in campaign contributions from industry employees during the primaries, but donations to the Republican side of the ledger were split among a much larger number of candidates than on the Democratic side. During the Republican primaries, the industry had taken an early liking to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, giving him more than all his rivals combined, before he dropped out of the race in February.

A waste of money? Trump's border wall falling flat in Arizona: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump rode to the top of the Republican ticket promising a big, beautiful, powerful border wall with Mexico to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants. Along that border, however, Americans are more likely to call the wall a waste of money, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll. The results show that while the New York businessman may have expected his tough stance on immigration to fire up support nationally, it seems to be falling short in a state heavily affected by illegal immigration, and where he is now facing a surprising challenge from his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Asked if a wall would be an effective barrier or a waste of money, 47 percent of Arizona residents picked waste of money and 34 percent picked effective barrier, with the rest picking neither, according to the poll. Among Republicans, 21 percent picked waste of money and 57 percent picked effective barrier. Most Arizonans also believed it is not realistic to expect Mexico to pay for the wall, something Trump has vowed would happen if hes elected president on Nov. 8, according to the poll. The results lined up closely with nationwide opinions of Trumps immigration policy: 49 percent of American adults say the wall would be a waste of money and 31 percent say it would be an effective barrier. As big and powerful, as rich as this nation is, we cannot just leave the door open, said Tony Estrada, Santa Cruz County Sheriff, who has served in law enforcement in the border county for 49 years. But, we need a realistic and humane process. Donald Trump is  catering to peoples fear. Polls show Arizona, a state that has voted Democrat only once in a presidential election since 1952, has become competitive. The Real Clear Politics average of polls showed Clinton ahead there by 1.3 percentage points. Reuters/Ipsos polling shows Trump ahead there by 4 points.  Clintons campaign said last week it would spend $2 million more campaigning in Arizona before the election. Arizonas border with Mexico is 370 mileslong, covering an isolated desert terrain that has drawn millions seeking to cross illegally. The states number of undocumented immigrants has fallen 35 percent from a 2007 peak to 325,000, according to the Pew Research Center, as Arizona cracked down on that population. Nationwide, the number has dropped 9 percent from a high in 2007 to 11.1 million undocumented immigrants. Wendy Cornacchio, a 45 year-old Trump supporter from Phoenix, said she believes illegal immigration is still a problem  but she would rather see technologies like drone surveillance than Trumps wall to address it. I dont think that necessarily building a wall will work, but the concept of closing the borders I agree with, she said. Florida is another closely-fought state that has seen large levels of illegal immigration, though by sea rather than by land. Some 41 percent of voters there said they believed Trumps wall would be a waste of money, while 36 percent thought it would be an effective barrier. Progressive activist groups in both Florida and Arizona have been using Trumps hard line on immigration against him to mobilize Latinos for Clinton, who advocates a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants. Mi Familia Vota, for example, says they registered more than 15,000 people in Arizona this year. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English and Spanish in Arizona and Florida. The Arizona poll ran from Oct. 5 to Oct. 19 and gathered responses from 2,600 people. The Florida poll ran from Oct. 5 to Oct. 12 and gathered responses from 2,610 people. Both polls have a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points for the total group and 3 percentage points for likely voters. ",politicsNews,"October 23, 2016 ",1
Obama turns focus to U.S. Congress as he campaigns for Clinton,"LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Sunday campaigned in the battleground state of Nevada for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate he wants to succeed him in the White House - but he spent most of his time talking about the states Senate race. Democrats badly want to get back control of the Republican-controlled Senate in the Nov. 8 election, and are sending Obama, Michelle Obama and Joe Biden to states where close races could tip the balance. In Nevada, Obama reserved most of his firepower for mocking three-term Republican U.S. Representative Joe Heck, who had supported his partys presidential candidate until earlier this month when Donald Trumps campaign went into crisis mode by the release of a video in which he lewdly bragged about groping and kissing women. I understand Joe Heck now wishes he never said those things about Donald Trump, but theyre on tape, theyre on the record, Obama said, using Hecks earlier praise of Trump against him. Its not just the Senate. Obama wants to capitalize on his high approval rating to help elect more Democrats to the House of Representatives, and has also endorsed about 150 candidates in state legislative races. At an intimate fundraising dinner in La Jolla, California, on Sunday evening, where tickets started at $10,000, Obama urged about 60 guests to help elect Democratic congressional candidate Doug Applegate, a former Marine colonel who is challenging Republican incumbent Darrell Issa. As far as I can tell, (Darrell) Issas primary contribution to the United States Congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere, Obama said. Issa, the former head of the House Oversight Committee, led a series of headline-grabbing investigations into Obamas administration - but has featured a photo of Obama signing legislation on a campaign brochure. Now that is the definition of chutzpah! Obama said. Last week, Obama excoriated Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida - who has a narrow lead over Democratic challenger Patrick Murphy, a congressman - for failing to repudiate Trump. In the final two weeks leading up to Nov. 8, Clinton said she planned to work hard to support congressional and state races. Were going to be emphasizing the importance of electing Democrats down the ballot, Clinton told reporters traveling with her on Saturday. In Las Vegas, Obama was introduced by the Democratic Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto, a two-term Nevada attorney general, who would be the first Latina elected to the U.S Senate if she wins. We cant elect Hillary and then saddle her with a Congress that is do-nothing, wont even try to do something, Obama said. The Nevada Senate seat is the only Senate race this year that Republicans could flip to their control. The seat has long been held by Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, who is retiring. Cortez Masto currently has a slim 2.3 percentage point lead in an average of polls tracked by RealClearPolitics over Heck. Obama won Nevada in 2008 and 2012. Polls show Clinton with a 4.2 percentage point lead at 45.4 percent support to Trumps 41.3 percent, according to the RealClearPolitics average. ",politicsNews,"October 24, 2016 ",1
Mexico president says Trump visit could have been done better,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Sunday defended his decision to host a visit by U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump to Mexico, but he said it could have been carried out in a better way. The hastily arranged meeting of Trump and Pena Nieto on Aug. 31 sparked outrage in Mexico because of Trumps verbal attacks on Mexicans as well as his threats to build a border wall and tear up trade deals with Latin Americas No. 2 economy.  I faced a dilemma of yes or no once I had made the proposal and he said yes. Because, at the end of the day, its all about ensuring the best interests of Mexico, even if it could be very controversial, as it turned out to be, Pena Nieto said in an interview on Mexicos Canal 11 television. Pena Nieto had invited both Trump and his rival Hillary Clinton, who turned down the offer.  Could we have done things better? Maybe yes, admittedly. I think that this genuine interest to bring about a meeting to take care of Mexicos interests, I think, could have been done in a better way, he said.  During his visit, Trump struck a collaborative tone with Mexico. But as soon as he was back in the United States, he told a crowd in Arizona that Mexico would pay for his massive border wall 100 percent. Backlash from the visit forced the resignation of Pena Nietos finance minister and trusted aide Luis Videgaray, who had helped arrange the meeting. ",politicsNews,"October 24, 2016 ",1
U.S. options market not very 'Trumped up' ahead of vote,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Prospects that the presidential election will inject a hefty dose of volatility into U.S. stock markets are fading fast as Republican Donald Trumps victory odds lengthen. A reading of positioning data on options tied to the benchmark S&P 500 index shows little pickup in demand for contracts that would offer investors downside insurance in the event that stock prices take a major hit right after the Nov. 8 election. Moreover, based on options term structures - calculated from prices of options with different expirations - it is hardly evident at all that investors are positioning for an uncertain outcome, even with Election Day barely two weeks away, Michael Purves, head of derivatives research at Weeden & Co, said. There had been a modest premium bump for November options a few weeks ago, but that seems to have faded steadily with Trumps slide in polls, Purves said. In a Reuters poll of equity strategists earlier this month, a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton was viewed as the more positive outcome for stock prices in the near term.  Trumps chances of defeating Clinton to capture the White House have diminished markedly over the last several weeks, according to most polls and prediction markets. The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project, which uses an online opinion poll to project election outcomes in all 50 states, estimates that Clinton has a better than 95 percent chance of winning the minimum of 270 Electoral College votes to claim the presidency if the election were held today. The most likely outcome would be 326 votes for Clinton to 212 for Trump. On PredictIt, a popular online predictions and betting market, Clintons implied chances of victory have risen to around 80 percent from around 63 percent a month ago. The lack of positioning for an election-related volatility shock is consistent across the options market. I just dont see a whole lot of shifting of positions. I dont see people taking on a very bearish stance or anything like that. Its a little bit surprising, said Randy Frederick, managing director, trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, Austin, Texas. If it was a much closer race it might have been a different story, but the polls have Hillary Clinton in a pretty solid lead right now and the market seems to be on board with that idea, Frederick said. A Brookings Institution study published on Friday from two U.S. economics professors concluded that a Clinton victory would further suppress stock market volatility, whereas a Trump victory would send it soaring. Justin Wolfers, of the University of Michigan, and Eric Zitzewitz, of Dartmouth College, said recent market reactions to pre-election events, including the first Trump-Clinton debate and the release of a video of Trump making vulgar comments about women, signal that equity volatility could fall by 15 to 30 percent with a Clinton win. (tinyurl.com/zl4ew4u) While the options market might be only a moderate catalyst for the S&P 500 index, individual sectors such as healthcare and energy might be more prone to election-related volatility, derivatives analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a recent note. And just because investors are not braced for election-linked stock gyrations is no guarantee that markets will remain calm, analysts said. Given that the market is not pricing a lot of volatility for November, the absence of positioning could aggravate a volatility shock in the event of a surprise result. If you think Trump will win, you want to get long SPX puts or long CBOE Volatility Index calls right now as protection, said Purves, referring to options contracts that profit from a jump in volatility. A clean sweep by the Democrats of the House of Representatives, the Senate and the White House could also unleash volatility, Purves said. Indeed, there is a very modest skew toward protective put options over more bullish calls among contracts expiring near the election. For S&P 500 index weekly contracts expiring on Nov. 11, puts outnumber calls by a 2.1-to-1 margin, compared with 1.9-to-1 for all expirations, according to Thomson Reuters data. Prices for at-the-money put and call contracts that expire on the eve of the election suggest a 1.8 percent move, up or down, in the S&P 500 by then, while comparable contracts expiring later that week see an up or down move of 2.1 percent. Nonetheless, demand for volatility protection remains low and such options are relatively cheap, and getting cheaper.  For instance, the cost for an S&P index option conveying the right to sell an S&P index future at the 2,050 level, about 4 percent below Fridays close, and expiring on Nov. 9, the day after the election, has plunged from $12.42 on Monday to $4.80 on Friday, a 61 percent decline. With Trump trailing in opinion polls, the focus ahead of the Nov. 8 vote is shifting to whether Republicans can keep their narrow majority in the Senate or even their larger advantage in the House of Representatives. Gridlock is the most market friendly outcome, and that is what the options market seems to be anticipating, Purves said. ",politicsNews,"October 24, 2016 ",1

Iran's president says U.S. election offers only bad or worse choice,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday the choice offered to voters in the U.S. presidential election was between bad and worse and that harsh exchanges in the debates pointed to a lack of morality in America, Tehrans arch adversary. America claims it has more than 200 years of democracy, and they have had 50 presidential elections, but there is no morality in that country, Rouhani said in a speech, carried live by state television. You saw the presidential debates, how they talk..., how they accuse and mock (each other), Rouhani told a crowd gathered at a stadium during his visit to the central city of Arak. Rouhani said a head of state had asked him during his visit to the United Nations in September about who he preferred between Republican candidate Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. I said should I prefer bad over worse or worse over bad?, said Rouhani, a pragmatist politician and cleric who may run for reelection in Irans presidential polls in May 2017. He did not say to which candidate his descriptions referred. ",politicsNews,"October 23, 2016 ",1
"Trump uses policy speech to attack media, promises to sue accusers","GETTSYBURG, Pa. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump promised on Saturday to foil a proposed deal for AT&T to buy Time Warner if he wins the Nov. 8 election, arguing it was an example of a power structure rigged against both him and voters.  Trump, whose candidacy has caused ruptures in his party, listed his policy plans for the first 100 days of his presidency in a campaign speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, near the site of a Civil War battlefield and a celebrated address by President Abraham Lincoln. But he also defiantly raised personal grievances, describing how, if elected, he would address them from the White House in a way he said would benefit Americans. The speech was billed by his campaign as a major outlining of his policies and principles. Many of the policy ideas Trump listed on Saturday were familiar, not least his promise to build a wall on the border with Mexico to deter illegal immigration and to renegotiate trade deals and to scrap the Obamacare health policy.  Moments after promising Americans that he represented a hopeful break from the status quo, he promised to sue nearly a dozen women who have come forward in the last two weeks to accuse him of sexual assault, calling them liars.  And he added a new threat to his repeated castigation of U.S. media corporations, which he says cover his campaign unfairly to help Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Theyre trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the American people, Trump, who often rails against media outlets and journalists covering his events, told supporters in his speech. Trump has not provided evidence for his assertion that the election would be rigged.  As an example of the power structure Im fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because its too much concentration of power in the hands of too few, Trump said.  Telecommunications company AT&T Inc (T.N) has agreed in principle to buy Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), one of the countrys largest film and television companies, for about $85 billion and an announcement could be made as early as Saturday.  Trump also said he would look at breaking up the acquisition by Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) of the media company NBC Universal in 2013. Deals like this destroy democracy, he said in explaining his apparent deviation from the traditional Republican position that seeks to minimize the taxation and regulation of American companies. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), the online retailer, should also be paying massive taxes, Trump said, reminding voters that Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post, a newspaper whose coverage Trump dislikes. Trump, a wealthy New York building developer and television star, acknowledged in a debate with Clinton on Oct. 9 that he had used investment losses to avoid paying taxes. The New York Times reported on Oct. 1 that Trumps declared loss of $916 million in 1995 was so large that he could legally have avoided paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years. At a campaign event later on Saturday in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Clinton criticized Trumps stance on news outlets, noting that she receives negative coverage too. When he blows up at a journalist or criticizes the press and goes on and on and on  you know, I get criticized by the press, she said. I believe thats part of our democratic system. In a statement, Clinton spokeswoman Christina Reynolds described the speech as rambling, unfocused, full of conspiracy theories and attacks on the media, and lacking in any real answers for American families. Although Trump on Saturday described his plans at least in part as a response to his belief media organizations had treated him unfairly, he argued that less wealthy voters had even greater cause to worry. When a simple phone call placed with the biggest newspapers or television networks gets them wall-to-wall coverage with virtually no fact-checking whatsoever, here is why this is relevant to you, he said. If they can fight somebody like me who has unlimited resources to fight back, just look at what they could do to you, your jobs, your security, your education, your health care. Trump, who has said he may not accept the elections outcome if he loses, is trailing Clinton in most polls - although he has narrowed the gap according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday. Clinton maintained her commanding lead in the race to win the Electoral College, however, and claim the U.S. presidency, a Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project poll released on Saturday showed.     Trump has bluntly said that Mexico will pay for the wall, an idea the Mexican government has scoffed at. He tweaked his language on Saturday, saying the United States would fully fund the wall with the understanding that Mexico would reimburse the cost. Trumps campaign was thrown into crisis two weeks ago when  a 2005 video was released showing him bragging about groping and kissing women, prompting several prominent Republicans to announce they would not vote for him. Since then, at least 10 women have said Trump made unwanted sexual advances, including groping or kissing, in incidents from the early 1980s to 2007, all of which Trump has denied. On Saturday, Jessica Drake, an adult film actor, accused Trump of pressuring her to have sex with him 10 years ago when they met at a golf tournament. After that, she said a man, possibly Trump, called her to offer her $10,000 if she would have sex with him, which she declined. Trumps campaign said the accusations were false. Trump, 70, said he was being attacked because he was an outsider who had never previously run for office, which he argues is a virtue. The fact that Washington and the Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our campaign is only more proof that our campaign represents the kind of change that only arrives once in a lifetime, he said.

Clinton far ahead in Electoral College race: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton maintained her commanding lead in the race to win the Electoral College and claim the U.S. presidency, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project results released on Saturday. In the last week, there has been little movement. Clinton leads Donald Trump in most of the states that Trump would need should he have a chance to win the minimum 270 votes needed to win. According to the project, she has a better than 95 percent chance of winning, if the election was held this week. The mostly likely outcome would be 326 votes for Clinton to 212 for Trump. Trump came off his best debate performance of the campaign Wednesday evening but the polling consensus still showed Clinton winning the third and final face-off on prime-time TV. Trump disputes those findings. And some national polls had the race tightening a wee bit this week though others had Clinton maintaining her solid lead. But the project illustrates that the broader picture remains bleak for Trump with 17 days to go until the Nov. 8 election.  Trump did gain ground in South Carolina where his slim lead last week expanded to seven points, moving it into his column from a toss-up. Unfortunately for him, he lost ground in Arizona, which is now too close to call. Additionally, he is facing a challenge for Utahs six Electoral College votes from former CIA operative and Utah native Evan McMullin. The independent candidate is siphoning votes away from Trump in a state that is Republican as any in the nation. In some polls, McMullin is even leading. (The States of the Nation is not polling on McMullin.) Utah, like almost all of the states, is a winner-take-all contest. Clinton has also maintained a lead in Florida and Pennsylvania, which have a combined 49 Electoral College votes. Ohio remains too close to call. According to the project, lower voter turnout generally benefits Trump but his best hope for success is if Republican turnout surges and Democratic turnout is low. To examine these results and other scenarios, go to the States of the Nation project here . ",politicsNews,"October 22, 2016 ",1
Trump to lay out what he would do in first 100 days if elected president,"(Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will lay out on Saturday what he would do in the first 100 days of his administration should he win the Nov. 8 election. Trumps outline - which he will deliver in a speech in the historic town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania - will cover his plans for boosting Americans economic and physical security and contrast them with those of Democrat Hillary Clinton, campaign aides told reporters on Friday. Clinton published a book of her own policy ideas earlier this year. Trump is trailing Clinton in most polls - although he has narrowed the gap according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday - and has less than three weeks to catch up.  Much of the campaign in recent weeks has focused on allegations that he made improper advances to women over decades, something he denies. It is also being dominated by Trumps accusation that the election is rigged and that he may not accept the result. Trump aides said Gettysburg, the site of a major Civil War battle and Republican President Abraham Lincolns famous address, was a fitting place for Trump to lay out a positive vision for the future of his party, which has suffered a schism between his supporters and the partys establishment.  Trump has planted some new policy details in recent speeches as he seeks to shift attention away from the recent controversies. In the past week, for example, he laid out ethics rules to shut the revolving door between government and lobbying and proposed term limits for members of Congress. Trumps aides said he would unveil additional new policy details Saturday. They would not elaborate. ",politicsNews,"October 22, 2016 ",1

"Trump gains on Clinton, poll shows 'rigged' message resonates","NEWTOWN, Pa./NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gained on his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton among American voters this week, cutting her lead nearly in half, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling released on Friday. The polling data showed Trumps argument that the Nov. 8 election is rigged against him has resonated with members of his party. Remember folks, its a rigged system, Trump told a Pennsylvania rally on Friday. Thats why youve got to get out and vote, youve got to watch. Because this system is totally rigged. Clinton led Trump 44 percent to 40 percent, according to the Oct. 14-20 Reuters/Ipsos poll, a 4-point lead. That compared with 44 percent for Clinton and 37 percent for Trump in the Oct. 7-13 poll released last week. An average of national opinion polls by RealClearPolitics shows Clinton 6.2 percentage points ahead at 48.1 percent support to Trumps 41.9 percent. Trump is slated to give a speech Saturday in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, best known as the site of a decisive Civil War battle and cemetery, and the place where Republican President Abraham Lincoln delivered his famous address. Aides told reporters on Friday night that Trump would make his closing argument to voters in his speech, and preview what he would do in his first 100 days in the White House. I think this site is fitting in terms of understanding a positive vision for the Republican party, an aide said. Trumps campaign was thrown into crisis after a 2005 video released this month showed him bragging about groping and kissing women. He has since faced accusations - which he has said are absolutely false - that he made improper sexual advances to women over decades. The Reuters/Ipsos survey found 63 percent of Americans, including a third of Republicans, believe the New York real estate mogul has committed sexual assault in the past. Reuters contacted a few of the poll respondents who said they felt that Trump had likely committed sexual assault but were still supporting his candidacy. Their answers were generally the same: Whatever Trump did with women in the past is less important to them than what he may do as president. At a Trump rally in Fletcher, North Carolina, Harold Garren, 75, said he was skeptical of complaints from women about Trumps behavior. I dont believe all of this 30 years later, no, Garren said. Garren also shrugged off Trumps lewd bragging about women, caught on the 2005 tape. Ive used that barnyard language myself, Garren said, clarifying that it was when he was younger and before he knew better. Both candidates spent Friday in battleground states, where the vote could swing either way. Clinton, 68, campaigned in Ohio, while Trump, 70, was in North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Trump, his voice lacking some of its usual energy in his third rally in one day, told voters in Newtown, Pennsylvania they had to vote or else he would have wasted a lot of time, energy and money. Trump has been coy about whether he will accept the results of the election should Clinton beat him. The Reuters/Ipsos data showed only half of Republicans would accept Clinton as their president, and nearly 70 percent of them said a Clinton victory would be because of illegal voting or vote rigging. Trumps crowd chanted Lock her up! at a rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania after he declared Clinton a corrupt globalist, a reference to campaign documents released by WikiLeaks in which Clinton was quoted advocating free trade and open borders. After the chant went around the room for several seconds, Trump responded, Dont worry, that whole thing will be looked into. The New York businessmans assertion that the election is being rigged and his refusal to commit to accepting the outcome of the election if he loses has challenged a cornerstone of American democracy and outraged Democrats and many Republicans. Asked if he would commit to a peaceful transition of power during Wednesdays debate, Trump replied: What Im saying is that I will tell you at the time. Ill keep you in suspense. OK? In Ohio on Friday, Clinton called his refusal unprecedented. Now make no mistake: by doing that, he is threatening our democracy, she told a rally in Cleveland. But we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship, right? And the peaceful transition of power is one of the things that sets us apart, Clinton said. Trump has offered no widely accepted evidence to back up his claims of vote-rigging. Numerous studies have shown that the U.S. election system, which is run by the states, is sound. Trump told an earlier rally in Fletcher, North Carolina, that he wanted to have no regrets about whether he worked hard enough to win the election, and urged followers to get out to vote. Win, lose or draw - and Im almost sure if the people come out, were going to win - I will be happy with myself, he said. We have to work, we have to get everybody out there.

Half of Republicans would reject election result if Clinton wins: Reuters/Ipsos,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump has repeatedly called this years presidential election rigged and has coyly said I will keep you in suspense on whether he would accept a Hillary Clinton victory, but many Republicans are less circumspect, according to a new poll. Only half of Republicans would accept Clinton, the Democratic nominee, as their president. And if she wins, nearly 70 percent said it would be because of illegal voting or vote rigging, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday. Conversely, seven out of 10 Democrats said they would accept a Trump victory and less than 50 percent would attribute it to illegal voting or vote rigging, the poll showed. The findings come after repeated statements by Trump that the media and the political establishment have rigged the election against him. He also has made a number of statements encouraging his supporters to fan out on Election Day to stop ineligible voters from casting ballots. The U.S. government has accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations and state election systems. Clinton has said she will accept the results of the election no matter the outcome. The poll showed there is broad concern across the political spectrum about voting issues such as ineligible voters casting ballots, voter suppression, and the actual vote count, but Republicans feel that concern more acutely. For example, nearly eight out of 10 Republicans are concerned about the accuracy of the final vote count. And though generally they believe they will be able to cast their ballot, only six out of 10 are confident their vote will be counted accurately. Among Democrats, about six out of 10 are concerned about the vote count. They, too, believe they wi1l be able to cast their ballot, but eight out of 10 are confident their vote will be counted accurately. Republicans are just more worried about everything than Democrats, said Lonna Atkeson, a professor at the University of New Mexico and head of the Center for the Study of Voting, Elections, and Democracy. Additionally, seven out of 10 Republicans are concerned about issues such as vote buying, faulty voting machines, or confusing ballot designs. Six out of 10 Democrats feel the same way. Nearly eight out of 10 Republicans are concerned that ineligible voters, including non-citizens, will illegally cast ballots. Four out of 10 Democrats feel the same way. Six out of 10 respondents, regardless of party, say they are concerned about issues such as voter intimidation and suppression.  Atkeson said the level of concern and mistrust in the system, especially among Republicans, is unprecedented. Ive never seen an election like this. Not in my lifetime. Certainly not in modern history. The difference, she said, is Trump. It has to be the candidate effect.  She worries that the lack of trust is dangerous. It is one thing to not trust government, but quite another to doubt the election process. Then the entire premise of democracy comes into question, she said. About one in five Democrats said they would protest if their candidate loses. Slightly fewer Republicans said they would do the same. Fewer than one in 10 Democrats said they are prepared to take up arms in opposition compared to fewer than one in 20 Republicans. Democrats are also are three times as likely to say they would leave the country. There is one area where there is little disagreement:Most people do not expect the losing candidate to concede the race gracefully.  The poll surveyed 1,192 American adults online from Oct. 17 to 21. The results have a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points. The credibility interval for Democrats is 5.1 percentage points; for Republicans it is 5.5 points.

"Trump gains on Clinton despite furor over women, election comments","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump gained on Hillary Clinton among American voters this week, cutting her lead nearly in half despite a string of women accusing him of unwanted sexual advances and the furor over his disputed claims that the election process is rigged, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday. The survey also showed that 63 percent of Americans, including a third of Republicans, believe the New York real estate mogul has committed sexual assault in the past, though the Republican presidential candidate has denied the recent accusations. Clinton, the Democratic former secretary of state, led Trump 44 percent to 40 percent, according to the Oct. 14-20 poll, a 4-point lead, with the Nov. 8 election fast approaching. That compared with 44 percent for Clinton and 37 percent for Trump in the Oct. 7-13 poll released last week. Clintons lead also shrank in a separate four-way poll that included alternative party candidates: 43 percent supported her, while 39 percent supported Trump, 6 percent supported Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, and 2 percent supported Jill Stein of the Green Party. Support for Clinton had been mostly rising in the seven-day tracking poll since the last week of August, when the candidates were about tied. The latest reading showed that Trumps deficit narrowed to what it was before a video surfaced on Oct. 7 featuring him bragging about groping and kissing women. Several women have since accused him of making unwanted sexual advances in separate incidents from the early 1980s to 2007. Trump has denied the allegations, calling them totally and absolutely false. The latest poll included a separate series of questions that asked people what they thought of Trumps conduct around women. It found 63 percent of American adults, including 34 percent of likely Republican voters, agreed with the statement I believe Donald Trump has committed sexual assault in the past.  Reuters contacted a few of the poll respondents who said they felt that Trump had committed sexual assault but were still supporting his candidacy. Their answers were generally the same: Whatever Trump did with women in the past is less important to them than what he may do as president. Im embarrassed that our country cant come up with better candidates, to be honest with you, said Evelyn Brendemuhl, 83, of Hope, North Dakota. But hell appoint more conservative judges, and shes (Clinton) pro-abortion, and Im not for that. Gary Taylor, 59, a Republican from Colorado said his support stemmed mostly from a desire to see something different than the last eight years in the White House. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It included 1,640 people who were considered likely voters, given their voting history, registration status and stated intention to vote. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points, meaning results could vary by that much either way. The poll questions on Trumps unwanted sexual advances scandal were asked of 1,915 American adults, including 546 likely Republican voters. It had a credibility interval of 3 percentage points for all adults and 5 points for Republican voters. ",politicsNews,"October 21, 2016 ",1
Oklahoma rejects Russian request to monitor election in state,"(Reuters) - Oklahoma voting officials have denied a request from the Russian consulate in Houston to monitor the Nov. 8 general elections in the state, saying foreign delegates are not allowed into polling stations, an official said on Friday. The move comes as the U.S. government this month formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations to interfere with the U.S. election process. The consul general made similar requests to officials in Texas and Louisiana, local news reports said, and was rebuffed in both states. The Consulate General of the Russian Federation in Houston was not immediately available for comment.  The consulate asked to have personnel in Oklahoma to study the Nov. 8 presidential election and was told that state law forbids anyone other than election officials and voters into areas where votes are being cast, said Bryan Dean, spokesman for the Oklahoma State Election Board. In a letter provided by Oklahoma, Russian Consul General Alexander Zakharov asks to have a consulate officer at one of the ballot stations of Oklahoma with the goal of studying the U.S. experience in organization of (the) voting process.  Oklahoma Secretary of State Chris Benge said he hopes the Russian officials can watch the U.S. election process on TV. It is truly an amazing system, he wrote back in a letter provided by the state. U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing that individual states maintain the authority to approve or deny requests from parties to observe elections. When asked if it was a worry to have the Russian request coming on the heels of the U.S. accusations of the country trying to meddle in the vote, he replied: We dont have anything to hide  and were confident in the electoral system.  U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that the Russian government was conducting or orchestrating cyber attacks against the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, possibly to disrupt or discredit the election, in which Democrat Hillary Clinton faces Republican Donald Trump. A Kremlin spokesman has called the U.S. allegations nonsense, the Interfax news agency reported. ",politicsNews,"October 21, 2016 ",1
Trump seeks to bar personal conduct claims from Trump University trial,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Donald Trumps attorneys asked a U.S. judge to bar accusations about his personal conduct that have arisen during the presidential election campaign, which would include allegations of sexual misconduct, from the upcoming civil trial over Trump University. Students at Trump University claim they were defrauded by its real estate seminars. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has faced allegations from women that he inappropriately touched them. Trump denied those accusations. In a court filing late on Thursday, attorneys for Trump said evidence and statements from the election campaign should be barred from trial because they could unfairly prejudice the jury. The trial is set to begin on Nov. 28. Evidence including Trumps campaign speeches, tweets, his tax issues and controversy over his personal charity should not be considered by jurors, the filing said. All audio and video recordings publicized during the campaign should also be barred, the filing said, along with evidence about Trumps beauty pageants, casinos and corporate bankruptcies. Before trial begins in this case, prospective members of the jury will have the opportunity to cast their vote for president, Trumps lawyers wrote. It is in the ballot box where they are free to judge Mr. Trump based on all this and more. A spokeswoman for the plaintiffs declined to comment.  Trumps lawyers had argued that the lawsuit, filed in 2013 in a San Diego federal court, should be dismissed because the New York real estate mogul, while personally involved in developing the concept and curriculum, relied on others to manage Trump University by the time the plaintiffs purchased seminars.  Trump set off an uproar earlier this year when he accused the judge overseeing the case, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, of being biased against him because of the Trumps pledge to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico. Curiel was born in Indiana and is of Mexican descent. Trump is trailing in the polls to Democrat Hillary Clinton with less than three weeks until Election Day.  Trumps lawyers also asked Curiel to exclude evidence about students finances from the trial, saying the affordability of Trump University was not relevant to the trial. Lawyers for the students asked in separate court filings to bar other evidence, including testimonials attesting to the value of the seminars, partly because they are irrelevant to whether Trump University misrepresented the qualifications of its instructors.

U.S. sees 'too many' troubling statements from Philippines' Duterte,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has made too many  troubling statements recently that lend uncertainty over its ties with the United States and are at odds with their alliance, the White House said on Thursday. Weve seen too many troubling public statements from President Duterte over the last several months, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters at a daily press briefing. And the frequency of that rhetoric has added an element of unnecessary uncertainty into our relationship that doesnt advance the interests of either country. ",politicsNews,"October 21, 2016 ",1
"Trump's rigged election comments a 'gift to dictators', say Africans","JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - If Donald Trump is interested in rigged elections, Zimbabwean opposition leader Tendai Biti says he could teach him a thing or two. Biti was arrested for treason and detained for a month after daring to suggest his party had defeated President Robert Mugabe in a vote in 2008. They denied me food. They beat me up. They put me in leg irons. They beat me in the private parts, Biti, a lawyer who later served as finance minister in an eventual unity government, told Reuters. Thats real election rigging. To opposition figures in Africa, and in other parts of the world that lack the 240-year U.S. history of peaceful transitions of power, Trumps assertion that Novembers U.S. presidential election will be rigged, and his declaration that he may not accept the outcome, are dangerous words. Donald Trump is a gift to all tin-pot dictators on the African continent. He is giving currency and legitimacy to rigging because if it can exist in America, it can exist anywhere, Biti said. He has no idea what hes talking about, absolutely no idea, said Biti, who speaks from the experience of three election defeats to Mugabe, a 92-year-old ex-guerrilla who has run Zimbabwe since independence in 1980. It makes us cross because in Africa theres real election rigging. Long-serving rulers who have faced U.S. criticism in the past are already using Trumps remarks to counter Washingtons pro-democracy message. When Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, in power for 30 years, won re-election to his seventh term in February, U.S. officials accused his government of arresting opposition figures, harassing their supporters and intimidating the media. Trumps comments, said Musevenis spokesman Don Wanyama, should be an eye-opener to them. As they sit down to lecture other countries, they should realize that its not easy. Democracy is a process and it really takes time. Trump refused during a debate on Wednesday to say whether he would respect the result of the Nov. 8 poll. That sent a chill down the spine of Musikari Kombo, a former local government minister in Kenya, where 1,500 people were killed in a wave of ethnic bloodletting unleashed by disputes over the result of a 2007 election. I was shocked. I was horrified, Kombo said. People in Africa who have always challenged elections will say: You see, we are vindicated. Even in the Mother of all Democracies, the presidential candidate is not willing to accept because there is rigging. U.S. officials, including state governors from Trumps own Republican Party, say there is no serious vote fraud problem in the United States and the election will be clean. Nevertheless, Trump and some allies have alleged anomalies in the voter roll in cities such as Philadelphia and Chicago that could allow the votes of dead people to be counted on behalf of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. It is hard to think what they would have made of this years election in Gabon, where opposition leader Jean Ping cried foul after narrowly losing to President Ali Bongo, whose family have ruled the oil-producing former French colony for half a century.  The focus of Pings concern was the province of Haut-Ogooue, where results showed 95.46 percent of voters backed Bongo on a turnout of 99.9 percent, more than double anywhere else. Gabons constitutional court - led by the long-time mistress of Bongos father, Omar - upheld the result. I would say to Mr. Trump Come to Gabon to see what a fake democracy looks like, to see what a stolen election looks like, said Alexandre Barro Chambrier, a senior Ping adviser. There is no democracy here. There is the rule of one family and one man imposing a dictatorial regime, he added. Mr Trump is not serious. ",politicsNews,"October 20, 2016 ",1
"Trump, Clinton tension seeps into jokes at annual charity dinner","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. presidential campaign tensions seeped into a high-profile charity dinner on Thursday as Donald Trump joked about sending Hillary Clinton to prison and she alluded to Trumps statements about women by estimating how he might rate the Statue of Libertys attractiveness a four, maybe a five. The candidates shared the stage at a formal dinner in New York City named for the states former governor, Alfred E. Smith, less than 24 hours after finishing their third and final presidential debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday. The annual event, which raises money for needy children, typically offers presidential hopefuls a respite from the tension of the campaign trail. But Trump and Clinton opted to instead trade sharpened barbs that reflected the acrimony of the 2016 White House campaign. Trump spoke first and set the room on edge with bitter jabs at his rival, with his label of Clinton as corrupt drawing boos. With all of the heated back and forth between my opponent and me at the debate last night, we have proven that we can actually be civil to each other, Trump said. In fact just before taking the dais, Hillary accidentally bumped into me and she very civilly said, Pardon me. And I very politely replied, Let me talk to you about that after I get into office, said Trump, a Republican whose supporters chant lock her up at rallies. Clinton, whose remarks elicited both polite applause and derision, riffed off Trumps derogatory remarks about womens appearances, such as joking in a 2002 radio interview that they become less attractive after age 35. Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a four, maybe a five if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair, Clinton said of the New York City landmark. Come to think of it, you know what would be a good number for a woman? 45, Clinton said. The president elected on Nov. 8 will be the 45th in U.S. history. Trump and Clinton sat just a seat apart on the dais, separated by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York. At the events conclusion, they shook hands  a gesture they avoided at Wednesdays debate.  But the tone of both candidates remarks was a departure from the past, when political figures and presidential candidates have stuck to a largely self-deprecating and good-natured brand of humor. At one point at the event, which raised $6 million for Catholic charities supporting children, Trump said Clinton was pretending not to hate Catholics.  Trump was referring to the apparently hacked personal emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, published by Wikileaks, which show Clinton staffers criticizing high-profile figures for embracing Catholicism as the most politically acceptable of socially conservative religions. Alfred Smith IV, the evenings host, perhaps best reflected the tension in the room, and the campaign, in his introductory remarks: This has been a campaign for the history books, he said. It has also been a campaign for the psychiatry books.     ",politicsNews,"October 21, 2016 ",1
"For Trump, challenging an election loss would be tough","(Reuters) - If Donald Trump were to challenge the outcome of next months presidential election, as he has hinted he might, he would face a difficult and expensive fight, according to election attorneys and a review of voting laws in key battleground states. Trump has said he is worried the Nov. 8 election might be rigged in favor of his opponent, Hillary Clinton, and in Wednesdays debate he refused to say he would accept the outcome. But before any court challenge, Trump probably would have to ask for a recount, said Donald Brey, a Republican election lawyer in Ohio. If the campaign did not pursue out-of-court options first, he said, a judge likely would dismiss the case. Recount rules vary from state to state. North Carolina, for example, doesnt allow a presidential candidate to request a recount at all if one candidate has a lead of more than 0.5 percent of the total votes cast. In Wisconsin, the challenging candidate must pay the full expense of a recount if the vote in dispute is more than 0.25 percent, and in Colorado if it is more than 0.5 percent. That can be expensive. Officials in one Wisconsin village put the cost of a local recount, in which about 9,000 votes were cast earlier this year, at nearly $13,000, said Michael Maistelman, a Wisconsin election lawyer who represented the unsuccessful candidate. More than 3 million people voted in the 2012 presidential election in Wisconsin. Deciding where to challenge the election would be complicated. Trump, who trailed Clinton by 7 percentage points nationwide in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week, is fighting tight battles in some key states. In Ohio, for example, an average of major opinion polls reviewed by the RealClearPolitics website found Trump to be leading by less than 1 percentage point. In Iowa, he is leading by nearly 4 percent. In some other battleground states, polls suggest support for Trump has eroded in recent weeks. According to the RealClearPolitics websites poll tally, Clinton has substantial leads in Virginia, Colorado and Wisconsin. She leads Trump by more than 6 percentage points in Pennsylvania, nearly 4 points in Florida and more than two points in North Carolina. To maximize his chances of overturning a Clinton win, Trump might need to challenge the results in several states, said Troy McCurry, a former Republican National Committee lawyer who was part of the partys recount team in 2012. Trump could try to bring a legal claim without first asking for recount by alleging, for instance, that an abuse of power by an election official, said McCurry, whos law firm represented Ted Cruz in the Republican primary before McCurry joined the practice. But if Trumps lawyers were unable to muster specific facts to support that premise, he said, a judge would dismiss the lawsuit. Any lawsuit that withstood early challenges would face an uncertain future. With the U.S. Supreme Court split 4-to-4 between liberal and conservative justices, state supreme courts or federal appeals courts could well make the final ruling in any election dispute.  In Pennsylvania, Colorado and Florida, where a majority of both state and federal appeals court judges have Democratic affiliations, Trump might face a more difficult road. Meanwhile, appeals courts in Ohio, Wisconsin and Iowa are more heavily Republican.  Ohio election attorney Brey, who said he dislikes but will vote for Trump, believes a challenge in Ohio would be a last-ditch effort for the candidate. Lets put it this way, he said. If Ohio is close, Trumps already lost. Trump also might face obstacles from his own party, attorneys said, because it would be reluctant to challenge results in a state where, say, it lost the presidential race but won a close U.S. senate race. Numerous studies have shown U.S. elections, which are decentralized and run by the states, are basically sound. Mr. Trump never mentions what criteria would be necessary for him to make a decision about a challenge, said Stephen Zack, an attorney who represented Vice President Al Gore in the case that was brought to the Supreme Court over the election recount in Florida in 2000. Basically it is left as, Ill see what it smells like and then I will surprise you, Zack said. There are rule-of-law issues that pertain to elections that separate us from anywhere else in the world.  Election officials in several states rejected suggestions the balloting might be rigged. Eric Spencer, election director in Arizona, said that while isolated incidents of voter fraud might occur and should be investigated, election workers come from all political parties and work with integrity.  The notion that the election is rigged is preposterous if not insulting, Spencer said. Some election watchers question how serious Trump is about a challenge. A lot of this is just posturing, McCurry said. At the end of the day I dont see how this happens.     ",politicsNews,"October 20, 2016 ",1
Trump says he will accept election result - if he wins,"WASHINGTON/DELAWARE, Ohio (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Thursday he would accept the result of the Nov. 8 election - if I win - fueling Republican concerns his stance would make it harder for his party to maintain control of Congress. His refusal to commit to accepting the election outcome was the standout remark of the third and final 2016 presidential debate between Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on Wednesday night. It ratcheted up Trumps allegations the election was being rigged against him, and became the latest flashpoint in an unusually acrimonious race three weeks before voters go to the polls. Clinton called the comment horrifying. President Barack Obama blasted Trump on Thursday at a rally in Miami Gardens, Florida, for Clinton and U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy, who is trying to unseat Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a Trump supporter.  That is dangerous. Because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in peoples minds about the legitimacy of the elections, that undermines our democracy. Then youre doing the work of our adversaries for them, Obama said. Trump modified his comment at a rally in Ohio on Thursday, but did not back off.  I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election - if I win, he said. He added he would accept a clear election result, but reserved the right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result. With Trump trailing in opinion polls, the focus ahead of the Nov. 8 vote is shifting to whether Republicans can keep their narrow majority in the Senate or even their larger advantage in the House of Representatives. Senator John McCain of Arizona, who lost the 2008 presidential election to Obama, said accepting the election result was the American way. I didnt like the outcome of the 2008 election. But I had a duty to concede, and I did so without reluctance, McCain, who has opened a poll lead in his Senate re-election race, said in a statement. A concession isnt just an exercise in graciousness. It is an act of respect for the will of the American people, a respect that is every American leaders first responsibility. McCain has withdrawn his support for Trump. Asked on Wednesday night if he would commit to a peaceful transition of power, Trump, a businessman-turned-politician, replied: What Im saying is that I will tell you at the time. Ill keep you in suspense. OK? Trumps statement, the most provocative in a debate that repeatedly descended into rancor, made headlines across the country and raised questions about his commitment to a peaceful transition of power, a cornerstone of American democracy. Clinton accused Trump of being Russian President Vladimir Putins puppet. Trump called Clinton a nasty woman and a criminal who should be barred from running. They did not exchange the customary handshake when the debate ended. On Thursday night the two candidates appeared together at a formal charity dinner in New York and shook hands there after giving speeches intended to roast each other. Just before taking the dais, Hillary accidentally bumped into me, and she very civilly said, pardon me, Trump joked. And I very politely replied, let me talk to you about that after I get into office. Trump has said Clinton should be imprisoned for her email practices as secretary of state. Clinton spoke after Trump at the dinner, which she joked was remarkable in itself. I didnt think hed be ok with a peaceful transition of power, she said. That show of humor was not the norm, however. Democrats jumped to ask Republican candidates whether they agreed with Trump, who is making his first run for public office against Clinton, a former senator and first lady. Do you agree with Donald Trump to question the results of the election? the Nevada Democratic Party asked in a release targeting Republican Joe Heck. Heck is in a tight race with Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto for retiring Democratic leader Harry Reids Senate seat. Trumps comments did not worry his supporters. Marion Fields, 48, a registered Democrat who backs Trump, said he did not think concession would be an issue because Trump would win. Were he to lose, After its announced, youd have to be a professional and concede. A CNN/ORC snap poll said 52 percent of Americans thought Clinton won the debate, to 39 percent for Trump. Trump donor and energy investor Dan Eberhart said Trump won. He disagreed with his rhetoric, but still backs the candidate. I think Hillarys policies and track record are not what the country needs leading us forward for the next four years. And that backs me into supporting Trump, Eberhart said. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway sought on Thursday to defend Trump, saying in television interviews he was putting people on notice about voting irregularities. Trump has not offered specific evidence to back up his vote-rigging claims, and numerous studies have shown that the U.S. election system, which is run by the states, is sound. Trump has stepped up allegations that the election is being rigged against a backdrop of accusations that he had made improper sexual advances to women since a video emerged two weeks ago in which Trump boasted of such behavior. A 10th woman came forward on Thursday at a news conference in Manhattan with attorney Gloria Allred, a Clinton supporter who specializes in representing women in cases of alleged assault. Trump campaign spokeswoman Jessica Ditto called the news conference a coordinated, publicity-seeking attack by Allred. First lady Michelle Obama, a powerful campaigner for Clinton, renewed her criticism of Trump without naming him during a campaign event in Arizona. Decent men do not demean women. And we shouldnt tolerate this behavior from any man, let alone a man who wants to be the president, she said. ",politicsNews,"October 19, 2016 ",1
Polling safeguards stepped up after Trump's 'rigged election' claim,"(Reuters) - Authorities in Philadelphia will station prosecutors throughout the city on election day to respond to any reports of voter intimidation or other illegal activity after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump claimed that polling might be rigged in this mostly minority city. Philadelphia is one of many U.S. municipalities wrestling with how to respond to Trumps call for supporters to watch polling places, and corresponding promises from civil rights groups that they will send their own backers to the polls. All of our election judges will be provided with cell phones that have direct access to the district attorneys office of Philadelphia, said Tim Dowling, chief deputy to City Commissioner Lisa Deeley. As soon as you cross the line, youre going to be dealing with law enforcement. The Nov. 8 presidential election has been among the most contentious in the nations history. Trump, whose campaign has been shaken by allegations that he groped numerous women after a video surfaced in which he made lewd comments about groping women, has refused to promise that he will accept the results of the election if he loses to Democrat Hillary Clinton. This week, Trump told supporters to watch polling places in such cities as Philadelphia, St. Louis and Chicago - all with large minority populations. As Trump has slipped in the polls, he has repeatedly said the election is rigged against him. Fearing that to be true, voters in Denver have been calling officials seeking reassurance, said Amber McReynolds, the citys director of elections.  Voters will call in and say, Is the election rigged? McReynolds said. We try to explain how the process works. ... Rigging an election is pretty much impossible. Various election experts, including Republicans, have said that it is virtually impossible to rig a presidential election, and numerous studies have shown that voter fraud in U.S. elections is very rare. In Arizona, a traditionally Republican state where polls have recently begun to show an increase in support for Clinton, poll workers are being trained to deal with an expected onslaught of observers, said Elizabeth Bartholomew, spokeswoman for elections officials in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located. In North Carolina, where a local Republican party headquarters was badly damaged on Sunday in an unsolved arson attack, state elections officials are taking extra steps to address poll security. On Wednesday, the state elections boards executive director, Kim Strach, sent county elections officials a memo outlining examples of prohibited behavior at polling places and emphasizing that state and federals laws bar intimidation and coercion at the polls. In Philadelphia, teams from the district attorneys office will be stationed throughout the city, ready to respond at a moments notice, Dowling said. The city is also increasing security at polling places, demanding for the first time identification even from credentialed poll-watchers sent by political parties. The city has activated such teams in previous elections, but this year there are more, and they will be set up at police stations. Because of all the rhetoric, were erring on the side of caution, Dowling said. Despite the high-profile nature of the claims, fears about intimidation at polling places may be overblown. Some of Trumps supporters have distanced themselves from his remarks about watching the polls. Many jurisdictions allow poll watchers, but they generally have to be credentialed and their numbers are limited. Several elections officials said they had so far not received an unusually high number of requests for poll-watcher credentials. In Leon County, Florida, for example, where the state capital of Tallahassee is located, 55 people affiliated with the Democratic Party had registered as poll watchers to observe early voting, which begins Monday. Two had signed up on behalf of Trump, and none for the Republican Party, Ion Sancho, supervisor of elections for the county. We dont believe there will be any problems at the polls, he said. Florida civil rights activist Becca Guerra said she is not worried about voter intimidation inside polling places because of rules on electioneering and on poll watchers, but voters may have trouble outside in the parking lot. We are training our folks to be the eyes and ears, she said.  ",politicsNews,"October 21, 2016 ",1
Trump supporters tricked into buying beers at Mexico City booze-up,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Supporters of U.S. Republican candidate Donald Trump unwittingly helped pick up the tab for a booze-up in Mexico City on Thursday, after they were duped into buying cleverly concealed anti-Trump t-shirts designed by a local brewery. Trump, who has labeled Mexicans rapists and drug runners, has caused outrage south of the border with his vow to build a border wall that Mexico will pay for - a pledge that inspired brewer Cerveza Cucapas ingenious scheme to get Trump supporters to cough up for Mexicans brews. Its amazing that we can have a party paid for by Donald Trump! said 54-year-old Leticia Villanueva, cradling her free beer at the event which had attracted a few hundred people.   Late last month, Cucapa, an artisanal brewery from the northern border state of Baja California, posted a video in which representatives went to the United States to hawk blue t-shirts with Trumps face that ostensibly say I support Donald. However, unbeknown to the buyer, when they put on the t-shirt, their body temperature adds a clowns nose to Trumps face and alters the message to read Donald: El que lo Lea, a traditional message meaning Whoever reads this is Donald. Proceeds from the tongue-in-cheek publicity stunt helped fund the event on Thursday in Mexico City, where a well-heeled crowd of young boozers in bright yellow Trump wigs took cheer from the property moguls recent collapse in the polls.  His campaign is garbage, and the only good thing hes ever done is get us drunk, said 21-year-old Ivan Grajeda. Its great that hes losing ... thats a triumph for Mexico. Others hoped that their family in the United States would turn out and vote in the Nov. 8 election for Hillary Clinton, who has strengthened her lead against Trump in recent weeks after her Republican rival faced a string of groping allegations. I ask my family members over there to vote for Hillary, as its not in their interests for Trump to win, said Jose Ramon Trevino, 28.  I have family in Chicago and they are hard-working people, who dont go looking for problems or beg for money in the street. Esteban Pacheco, a 26-year-old Cucapa employee, said the aim of the brewers campaign was to build bridges between the two countries.  We want to unite the people with these types of activities, he said. ",politicsNews,"October 21, 2016 ",1
Trump's war chest one of smallest in recent presidential campaigns,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump could go down as the least well-funded presidential candidate in recent campaigns - entering the final month of the election still without the cash to match the level of staff and advertising that has helped power the campaign of his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. With less than three weeks until the election, it is too late for Trump to amass the amount of cash he would need to unleash a spending assault that might turn his hobbled campaign around. Through the end of September, Trump raised a total of $163 million - a far cry from Clintons $449 million. Trump, a New York real estate developer who has boasted about his wealth, pledged to use millions of his personal assets to fund his campaign. In addition to the $163 million raised, he put in $47.5 million during the primary and then added another $8.6 million. Trumps fundraising deficit has resulted from a series of campaign crises that made wealthy donors reluctant to contribute to his campaign and reflects that he does not enjoy working the fundraising circuit or calling large-dollar donors to ask them to write checks. Thats a big disadvantage for Trump. And it shows in how he has been outspent trying to win the Nov. 8 election for the White House, particularly in the two largest spending categories: staff and television commercials. When it comes to staff, Trump has spent $5 million, compared with Clintons spending of about $38 million.  Trump had 168 people on his payroll in September, more than doubling the 82 he had on staff in July. Additionally, Trump spent $5 million on field consultants, part-time workers who are not part of the main staff. Clinton had 815 people on her staff in September.  On advertising, Trump has spent $48.7 million while Clinton has spent $204 million - allowing her to blanket the airwaves with a deluge of advertisements. It has also allowed Clinton to inject more money into states that have become closer as Election Day nears. Earlier this week, Clintons campaign announced it was spending an additional $2 million in Arizona, a late-game decision to try to win a traditionally Republican state that now appears within her grasp. Overall, Trump has spent about $190 million by the end of September, compared with Clintons $401 million.  Trump and Clinton can collect donations up to $5,400 from a single individual, but can also collect larger checks that are then divided between the campaign and joint fundraisers with the national and state parties.  The funds that candidates raise for the national and state political parties are still used for the common effort of hiring staff and getting voters to turn out to the polls. But those funds cannot be used in the most direct parts of running a campaign, like buying television ads or hiring staff that report to the campaign manager. Trumps campaign struggled to get organized and build out the infrastructure that is needed to be competitive in the key battleground states. Instead, Trump has been dependent on the infrastructure built by the Republican Party. Trump has raised $244 million through joint fundraising committees with the national parties, of which he got $71 million.  By comparison, Clinton has raised $415 million through joint fundraisers, of which $117 million went to her campaign. Since 2008, major party presidential candidates have stopped accepting public funding for their general election campaigns - which placed limits on the amount a candidate could raise and spend. But even the last candidate to accept public funds, Senator John McCain in 2008, raised more that year than Trump did this election. McCain raised more than $300 million. That same year, Barack Obama, in his first presidential race, raised $607 million. In 2012, Mitt Romney raised more than $337 million at this point in the campaign. And Obama had raised $564 million.  ",politicsNews,"October 21, 2016 ",1
U.S. vote authorities warned to be alert to Russian hacks faking fraud: officials,"(Reuters) - U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russias intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election. But hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said. They said that they did not have specific evidence of such a plan, but state and local election authorities had been warned to be vigilant for hacking attempts. On Oct. 7, the U.S. government formally accused Russia for the first time of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations to interfere with the election process. U.S. officials familiar with hacking directed against American voting systems said evidence indicates that suspected Russian government-backed hackers have so far tried to attack voter registration databases operated by more than 20 states. Tracing the attacks can be difficult but breaches of only two such databases have been confirmed, they said. The officials said there is no evidence that any hackers have succeeded in accessing equipment or databases used to record votes. Many states use systems that would be difficult to hack or defraud, including paper ballots which initially are tallied by machines. U.S. elections are run by state and local officials, not the federal government. On Nov. 8, votes will be cast in hundreds of thousands of polling stations in 9,000 different jurisdictions, according to the National Association of Secretaries of State. The U.S. officials declined to comment on Republican candidate Donald Trumps contention that the election is being rigged. Trump said in the third and final presidential debate with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton on Wednesday night that he would not say until the election results were known whether or not he would accept the outcome. Trump and his campaign officials have repeatedly said that the potential for voter fraud remains high but they have not provided any evidence. On Thursday, Trump said he would accept the results of the election if I win. He said he reserved the right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result.   Clinton supporters said Trump is unwittingly aiding an effort by Russian President Vladimir Putin to undercut the credibility of the vote. Washington and Moscow are at odds over several issues, from Russian involvement in the Ukraine conflict, the war in Syria and cyber attacks.  Trump does not even know he is being manipulated, said Michael Morell, a former deputy CIA director who has endorsed Clinton. Trump is an unwitting agent of Putin.

Long-time Arizona sheriff Arpaio trails in re-election bid: poll,"PHOENIX (Reuters) - Embattled Arizona lawman Joe Arpaio, whose get-tough policies to fight illegal immigration and praise of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump brought him nationwide attention, trails his opponent in this years election by nearly 15 percentage points, according to a Thursday poll. The poll, conducted by The Arizona Republic/Morrison/Cronkite News, shows Democratic challenger Paul Penzone has the support of nearly 45.9 percent of those surveyed as he attempts to unseat the six-term Maricopa County sheriff. Arpaio garnered 31.1 percent. Roughly one-fifth of those surveyed said they were still undecided on the Nov. 8 race for the top law enforcement job in the states most populous county. The polls margin of error was plus or minus 5.6 percent. The poll was taken as federal prosecutors announced that the U.S. Justice Department would seek a criminal contempt charge against Arpaio for violating a court order in a 2007 racial profiling case. The charges center on unlawful traffic stops and detentions by deputies of Latino drivers for 18 months after the judge ordered them to cease. Arpaio, who has denied any intentional wrongdoing, has already been cited for civil contempt stemming from his actions in the case. Political observers have said prospects of a criminal prosecution for the 84-year-old hardline sheriff seem to have raised the ante in recent days in what already promised to be Arpaios sternest election test. Arpaio campaign manager Chad Willems disputed the poll results, saying that the campaigns own survey has the sheriff leading Penzone by 7.5 points. The recent poll by the Arizona Republic is a complete joke, said Willems in a statement to Reuters, adding that Democrats were disproportionately included in the surveys sample size. The numbers in NO way accurately depict the electorate of Maricopa County, Arizona, he said. Why they chose to conduct their survey this way is beyond any comprehension. A Penzone campaign official could not immediately be reached for comment. Arpaio has continued to play on a national stage during his tenure as sheriff despite his legal battles. His calls for a crackdown on undocumented immigrants, opening a tent city to house inmates and making them wear pink underwear all have proved popular. He also has appeared for Trump, praising the Republican nominees border policies, including building a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. ",politicsNews,"October 20, 2016 ",1
Rigged elections? Nasty woman? Trump's scorched earth tactics have little upside,"(Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump had one last chance at a nationally televised debate to reach out to the undecided voters he badly needs to keep his presidential campaign viable.  He passed on the opportunity. Instead, he chose on Wednesday to stay with the strategy he has employed during recent weeks: Pump up his hard-core supporters and hope thats enough to win.  He suggested he might not accept the election result if his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton wins on Nov. 8, called her a nasty woman, and repeated hard-line conservative positions on issues such as abortion and immigration.  While that kind of rhetoric was catnip to his passionate, anti-establishment base, it is unlikely to have appealed to independent voters and women who have yet to choose a candidate. When youre trailing in the polls, you dont need a headline the next morning saying that youre not going to accept the election results, said Ford OConnell, a Republican strategist who supports Trump. With less than three weeks left in the race, Trump is behind Clinton in most battleground states and is underperforming in almost every demographic voter group compared to the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, four years ago. Party strategists had said before the debate that he needed to use the event to draw in voters beyond his hard-core supporters.  Trump didnt listen or perhaps didnt care. His debate was a continuation of his apparent strategy to ensure his most fervent supporters show up on Election Day, while betting that his attacks on Clintons character and truthfulness will discourage voting by already skeptical young and liberal Democrats. But experts who study voter behavior warned that his attacks on Clinton may backfire, saying he may instead awaken Democratic voters who have so far been uninspired by Clinton. The risk he faces by engaging in a scorched-earth policy is that he activates people rather than turning them off, said Michael McDonald, who runs the U.S. Election Project at the University of Florida. McDonald, who tracks early voting returns and absentee ballot requests, said he is seeing larger than expected surges of support for Clinton in southeastern states such as Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida. The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project, which uses a massive online opinion poll to project election outcomes in all 50 states, estimates that Clinton has a 95 percent chance of winning the election by about 118 votes in the Electoral College if it were held today. It is against this backdrop that Trump has apparently decided to double down on energizing his base rather than broadening it. But the poll results cast doubt on the wisdom of that strategy. If Trumps core white, male, working class supporters vote at high rates, as expected, that likely wont be enough to win. Trump, for example, already does well with white men who are at retirement age. Nine out of 10 of them are already expected to vote, according to the polling results, so, there is little room to squeeze out more votes. Voting rights activists have accused Trump of trying to suppress voter turnout by claiming, without evidence, that the election has been rigged against him. He has also said his supporters need to monitor polling stations to ensure a fair vote, which the activists decry as an act of intimidation.  Should Trumps comments succeed in discouraging some Democratic voters from turning out, that may also not be enough to help him secure the White House. He still loses under what could be considered a dream scenario for the Republican nominee: white men show up in greater numbers than expected, while turnout among racial minorities is lower than expected. In this scenario, the States of the Nation project estimates that Trump would win the battleground states of Ohio and North Carolina, and he would have a shot at winning Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Colorado. Even then, Clinton would still have an 82 percent chance of winning the election. Theres yet another risk to Trumps strategy. By claiming the election is rigged, he could be unintentionally signaling to his supporters that voting no longer matters. Michael Sopko, 63, a mortgage broker from Denver and a Trump backer, said before the debate that he sees his vote as pointless. They have already been corrupted, he said of voting machines, speaking ahead of a Trump rally in Colorado Springs. I think the results are already cast. ",politicsNews,"October 20, 2016 ",1
"In U.S. battle of election T-shirts, 'Nasty Woman' rules","NEW YORK (Reuters) - T-shirts inspired by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps such a nasty woman comment on Democrat Hillary Clinton in Wednesday nights debate were flying off internet retailers shelves, offering a possible hint on the Nov. 8 election result.  Sellers said on Thursday that demand came swiftly and was unrivaled minutes after the final debate ended. I have had nonstop orders since last night, Pennsylvania part-time graphic designer Naheed Snyder said of her T-shirt, designed simply with the words Nasty women vote, selling on Etsy. Its unbelievable how well this one has done... theres no comparison.  Merchandise retailers typically see a profit boost during election season as voters on both sides seek to wear support for their candidates, particularly around conventions, voting and this year, debates.  Traffic to Teespring.com, a website that allows users to create, sell and buy personalized T-shirts, spiked 40 percent during the second presidential debate and 120 percent in the third debate, the company said. Merchandise promoting the Republican candidate was steadily higher earlier in the race, said Maheesh Jain, co-founder of online customizable merchandise retailer CafePress. Some of the most popular items included the slogans I am a deplorable and Hillary for prison.  At a fundraiser in September, Clinton said Trump had given voice to hateful rhetoric through his behavior as a candidate, and that you can put half of Trumps supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. The following day she said she regretted saying half and that she had been grossly generalistic.  In the last two weeks, after the release of Trumps 2005 lewd remarks toward women and an onslaught of women accusing him of sexual harassment or assault, the items have declined in popularity, Jain said. Trump has apologized for the remarks and denied the accusations. Right now, were definitely seeing a lot more Hillary merchandise selling than Trump merchandise, said Jain. Sales of pro-Clinton merchandise last week were 53.5 percent higherthan for Trump, Jain said. After the third and final presidential debate on Wednesday, Trumps nasty woman comment gave life to a new merchandise line aimed at assailing him. If Hillary Clinton is a nasty woman for being most likely our next president, maybe thats not such a bad thing, said Amanda Brinkman, who runs the online feminist-centered accessory shop Google Ghost. Maybe thats something you should wear as a badge of honor. Brinkmans Nasty Woman T-shirt, featuring the phrase with a heart around it, sold more than 6,000 times since she designed and posted it during Wednesdays debate. The second most-popular item in her stores history, a pen, at its peak garnered 25 sales in a single day. Brinkman, from New Orleans, said she is donating half of the proceeds to reproductive healthcare provider Planned Parenthood, which Trump opposes because it offers abortions. I thought it only made sense to use his own words to sell a product that would then benefit Planned Parenthood, Brinkman said. In past elections, Jain said, her company had seen a direct link between the most merchandise sold and the candidate that won the election. Typically, whoever is winning in the sales column will win the election, Jain said. Right now, were seeing Clinton winning the election. ",politicsNews,"October 20, 2016 ",1
"Final Trump-Clinton debate draws nearly 72 million viewers, third largest ever","(Reuters) - An estimated 71.6 million people watched the final debate between White House contenders Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on TV on Wednesday, below the audience for their first encounter but the third-largest total ever recorded.   The data supplied by the Nielsen ratings agency on Thursday covered people who watched Wednesday nights debate on the four main U.S. broadcast networks plus nine cable and public television channels. The first Clinton-Trump face-off in September attracted a total TV audience of 84 million, the largest in the history of U.S. presidential debates. Last weeks second debate, which was broadcast opposite popular Sunday Night Football, was seen by 66.5 million. Wednesdays audience ranked as the third-highest for a U.S.  presidential debate since Nielsen started collecting TV viewership figures for the encounters in 1976. A 1980 debate between Democratic President Jimmy Carter and Republican challenger Ronald Reagan drew 80.6 million viewers. Nielsen data reflects only those who watched the debate on TV at home and did not include millions more who watched online, through social media or in bars and restaurants. The third debate ahead of the Nov. 8 election was marked by Trumps refusal to commit to accepting the outcome of the election if the Republican candidate loses to his Democratic rival, challenging a cornerstone of American democracy. The presidential election debate, held in Las Vegas, was moderated for the first time by a journalist from Fox News, Chris Wallace. It gave Fox News cable channel  the lead in number of viewers for the debate at 11.2 million, followed by broadcasters ABC and NBC with more than 10 million viewers each. Second and third presidential debates have generally attracted smaller TV audiences because many voters have already made up their minds after a presidential campaign lasting more than a year.

Obama says his departure may fix what ails Obamacare,"MIAMI (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Thursday that his departure from office in January might be what it takes to begin to heal the political scars over Obamacare and allow for needed fixes to his signature healthcare law. The 2010 Affordable Care Act tipped off a long and bitter political and legal battle between the White House and Republicans in the U.S. Congress who said the 2010 law creates unwarranted government intervention in personal healthcare and private industry. Republicans have been quick to highlight a recent barrage of negative headlines about rising health insurance premiums and shrinking doctor networks for people participating in subsidized insurance plans offered under the law. Obama acknowledged the law is not working perfectly, but said the problems could be fixed by legislation, encouraging lawmakers to create a government-run health insurance option to help U.S. states where there is little or no competition among private insurers. Maybe now that Im leaving office, maybe Republicans can stop with the 60-something repeal votes theyve taken and stop pretending that they have a serious alternative ... and just work with the next president to smooth out the kinks, he said in a speech at Miami Dade College. They can even change the name of the law to Reagancare, or Paul Ryan care, Obama said, evoking the name of the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives. I dont care. I just want it to work. But Ryan, in a written response, said he would continue to seek to repeal and replace the law. At this point, one thing is clear: this law cant be fixed, Ryan said. Obama was later slated to headline a rally in Florida, a battleground election state, for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Clinton has said she would add a public option and expand tax incentives for healthcare costs. Republican nominee Donald Trump has pledged to repeal and replace the law. The government forecasts 13.8 million people will sign up for Obamacare plans in 2017, up 1.1 million from 2016. There are 10.7 million uninsured people who are eligible for the exchanges but have not enrolled, and about 40 percent of those are young, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said on Wednesday. Obama said that nationwide, not enough young and healthy people have signed up to provide a revenue stream that offsets the costs of covering members with serious illnesses. As a result, several big insurers, including UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), Aetna Inc (AET.N) and Humana Inc (HUM.N), are pulling out of the online marketplaces selling the subsidized plans, citing bigger-than-expected financial losses. Monthly premium prices have climbed, which further discourages some people from signing up. Next year will tell whether those are growing pains, or they are more serious issues, Drew Altman, chief executive of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said in an interview. Analysis conducted by the nonpartisan foundation suggests at least 16 million people need to enroll before the online Obamacare insurance marketplaces stabilize. Obama said expanding insurance coverage for millions of people and reforming the healthcare system was a key reason he ran for office. He said he gets letters from Americans every day thanking him for the difference it has made in their lives. The law cut the number of uninsured Americans from 49 million in 2010 to 29 million in 2015. Much of the decline is due to the laws provision allowing states to expand Medicaid health coverage for the poor. The law also prohibited insurance companies from denying coverage to Americans for existing medical problems, and allowed parents to keep children insured on their health plans until age 26. Some health policy experts on both the political left and right say Congress may be more receptive to bipartisan efforts to fix the Affordable Care Act after Obama leaves office. Some Republican governors who refused to expand Medicaid may also be more willing to do so after the election - a change that would expand coverage for about 4 million people. I think the piece of Obamacare that people dont like is Obama, Kathleen Sebelius, Obamas former Health and Human Services secretary, who oversaw the programs launch, said in an interview. This has become a very personal battle about this president, which is I think really unfortunate. ",politicsNews,"October 20, 2016 ",1
U.S. judge orders Virginia to extend voter registration through Friday,"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday ordered Virginia to reopen its voter registration window and allow residents to continue to sign up through midnight Friday, after its online registration portal was unavailable to many users earlier this week. U.S. District Judge Claude Hiltons order came in response to a lawsuit filed on Tuesday by the activist New Virginia Education Fund, which complained that the states online voter registration portal had worked erratically in the days leading up to the states initial Monday deadline to register. The lawsuit argued that the problems risked illegally denying thousands of people the right to vote in the Nov. 8 election. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe this year restored the right to vote to thousands of ex-felons, a move seen as potentially tipping what had been a traditional Republican stronghold in Democrats favor. I am pleased that the court has agreed with the request to extend Virginias voter registration period after unprecedented web traffic prevented many people from completing their registrations online before the original deadline, McAuliffe, a Democrat, said in a statement on Thursday.  The Commonwealth will fully comply with the courts order and extend our registration process online, in person and through the mail. State law gives the power to extend voting registration to the legislature, so McAuliffe had been unable to act until the judges ruling, noted Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond School of Law. The Republican-controlled legislature had declined to take any action following the flurry of complaints on Monday. The real question is if this leaves enough time to get the word out to people who had been blocked from registering and may not know that the issue has been resolved, Tobias added. Shortly after the judges decision was handed down in an Alexandria courtroom, the states Department of Elections updated its Web site to show the new deadline. Representatives of the New Virginia fund did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Recent polls show Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton leading Republican New York real estate developer Donald Trump in the state. The decision comes the week after a judge in North Carolina gave residents in counties hard hit by Hurricane Matthew additional time to register to vote. Similar steps were also taken in parts of Georgia, South Carolina and Florida following the storm.",politicsNews,"October 20, 2016 ",1
Factbox: Women who have alleged inappropriate conduct by Trump,"(Reuters) - Several women have accused U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump of sexual advances and groping. Among his accusers are a Miss Utah beauty pageant winner, a businesswoman, a reporter and a receptionist. He has denied the accusations. In a 2005 video that emerged on Oct. 7, Trump boasted about grabbing women by the genitals and kissing them without their consent. In a U.S. presidential debate on Oct. 9, he said he was embarrassed by what he called locker-room talk but had not engaged in the conduct he described in the video.  Trump has called absolutely false allegations by several women of groping and other misconduct, reported by The New York Times and other media. He has called the women sick, and at Wednesday nights final presidential debate, he alleged that the women were either controlled by Democratic opponent Hillary Clintons campaign or seeking their 10 minutes of fame.  Following are some of the allegations against Trump:  Jill Harth Houraney, a former Trump beauty pageant business associate, filed a $125 million lawsuit in 1997 against Trump alleging that on Jan. 24, 1993, at Trumps Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, Trump forcibly removed plaintiff to a bedroom, whereupon defendant subjected plaintiff to defendants unwanted sexual advances. A Trump representative was quoted on Oct. 7 in The New York Times as saying, Mr. Trump denies each and every statement made by Ms. Harth. The lawsuit was dropped in May 1997. Temple Taggart McDowell, a former Miss Utah, was quoted by The New York Times in a report published on May 15 as saying that Trump kissed me directly on the lips when the two were introduced in 1997, when she was 21. Taggart told the Times, I thought, Oh my God, gross. The Times story said Trump disputed the report and added that Trump said he is reluctant to kiss strangers on the lips. Jessica Leeds, 74, recounted in an video interview posted on The New York Times website on Oct. 12 that Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt on a flight to New York in or around 1980 when she was a 38-year-old traveling businesswoman. In a tweet and in a later speech on Oct. 13, Trump called the Times story a total fabrication. Rachel Crooks, formerly a receptionist at a real estate firm, told The New York Times in a report published on Oct. 12   that Trump kissed me directly on the mouth in 2005 at Trump Tower in Manhattan when she was 22. In a tweet and in a later speech on Oct. 13, Trump called the Times story a total fabrication. Natasha Stoynoff, a reporter, wrote a first-person account that described Trump kissing her without her consent in December 2005 at Trumps Florida home, Mar-a-Lago, while she was working on an article about him and his third wife, Melania, for People magazine. In the account published by People on Oct. 12, Stoynoff said he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat. In a tweet and in a later speech on Oct. 13, Trump said the episode described did not happen. Mindy McGillivray was cited in an article published in The Palm Beach Post on Oct. 12 that while she was a 23-year-old   photographers assistant at a Jan. 24, 2003, event at Mar-a-Lago, Trump had grabbed her buttocks. The Palm Beach Post cited a Trump spokesperson as saying, This allegation lacks any merit or veracity. Summer Zervos, who was a contestant on Trumps reality TV show The Apprentice in 2006, said at a news conference on Oct. 14 in Las Vegas that Trump tried to get her to lie down on a bed with him when she met him in 2007 to discuss a possible job. Zervos said she complied with a request to sit next to Trump, and, He then grabbed my shoulder and began kissing me very aggressively and placed his hand on my breast. Trump at a rally in North Carolina this month denounced the allegations made by a series of women, calling them fabrications. Kristin Anderson, in a video posted on the website of The Washington Post on Oct. 14, said Trump put his hand up her skirt in a crowded New York nightclub in the early 1990s in an unwanted advance, when she had never even met him. He did touch my vagina through my underwear, absolutely, Anderson said in the video interview. Trumps campaign did not respond to requests for comments on the allegations at the time they were made public.   Yoga instructor Karena Virginia, at a news conference in New York City on Thursday, said Trump approached her outside the U.S. Open tennis tournament in 1998. They had never met, and she was 27 years old, she said. She alleged that Trump commented on her legs and then touched her breast before she was able to get into a car and be driven away. Trump campaign spokeswoman Jessica Ditto said the accusation was a publicity-seeking attack coordinated with Clinton, and added: Voters are tired of these circus-like antics and reject these fictional stories.

"'Absolutely false,' Trump says defiantly after women's groping allegations","WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Donald Trump assailed as absolutely false the allegations by several women that he groped them, and accused Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, the media and lobbyists of engaging in an effort to stop him from winning the White House. With his numbers dropping in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 8 election, the Republican U.S. presidential nominee told supporters at a rally in Florida that his campaign was engaged in a struggle for the survival of our nation. Trump said accusations that he groped women in a series of incidents going back to the 1980s were part of a coordinated attempt to keep him from the Oval Office.     These vicious claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false, he said, adding that the Clintons know it. He said he would make public at some point evidence to dispute the charges. Ive never met these people. I dont even know who they are. Theyre made-up stories, Trump said later on Thursday during a speech in Ohio.  Trump spoke after The New York Times reported that two women said they had endured sexual aggression from him, and several other women made similar allegations in other media outlets. The New York businessmans campaign was already struggling to contain a crisis after a video surfaced last week showing him bragging in 2005 about groping women and making unwanted sexual advances. First lady Michelle Obama criticized Trump in scathing terms in a campaign speech for Clinton in New Hampshire on Thursday. Her voice close to cracking with emotion, Obama said, This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior, and actually bragging about kissing and groping women, using language so obscene that many of us were worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV. Its one of countless examples of how he has treated women his whole life, she added. ... The shameful comments about our bodies, the disrespect of our ambitions and intellect, the belief that you can do anything you want to a woman  it is cruel. One woman, Jessica Leeds, appeared on camera on The New York Times website to recount how Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt on a flight from the Midwest to New York in or around 1980. (nyti.ms/2dx8k5R) Leeds told CNN on Thursday that Trump also kissed her face in an incident that lasted about 15 minutes. Thats long enough, she said. The second woman, Rachel Crooks, described how Trump kissed me directly on the mouth in an unwanted advance in 2005 at Trump Tower in Manhattan, where she was a receptionist at a real estate firm. Reuters could not independently verify the incidents. Leeds and Crooks did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. The New York Times said on Thursday it stood by its story and rejected charges the article was libelous after a lawyer for Trump threatened legal action and demanded a retraction.         Trump has slumped in opinion polls in recent days as the uproar over the video threatened to engulf his White House campaign in a way that his earlier controversies had not. A Reuters/Ipsos survey showed one in five Republicans thought Trumps comments about groping women disqualified him from the presidency. The poll showed him 8 percentage points behind Clinton among likely voters.  Trump trailed Clinton by up to 11 percentage points in other polls.  Establishment Republicans have struggled to get behind Trump, alarmed by both his style and some of his policy proposals. Within hours of The New York Times report, several other media outlets published similar reports. People magazine published a detailed first-person account from one of its reporters, Natasha Stoynoff. (bit.ly/2dTm90D) Stoynoff said Trump pinned her against a wall at his Florida estate in 2005 and kissed her as she struggled to get away.  I turned around, and within seconds, he was pushing me against the wall, and forcing his tongue down my throat, Stoynoff said.  Trump, 70, denied the People story in a Twitter message and in his speech in Florida on Thursday, and mocked the writer. I ask her a simple question. Why wasnt it part of the story that appeared 12 years ago? Why didnt they make it part of the story ... if she had added that, it would have been the headline. Look at her and look at her words, he said. You tell me what you think. I dont think so. Trumps wife, Melania, on Thursday posted on Twitter a letter from her attorney to People that said details in the story were false, pointing to Stoynoffs recollection in the piece that she later ran into Melania Trump and spoke to her in New York City.  The attorney, Charles Harder, said in the letter that Stoynoff and Melania Trump were never friends or even friendly and demanded that People print a prominent retraction and apology. The Palm Beach Post reported an allegation by Mindy McGillivray, 36, a woman in South Florida, that Trump had grabbed her bottom 13 years ago while she was working at his Mar-a-Lago estate as a photographers assistant. There is no truth to this whatsoever, Trumps spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, told the Post. McGillivray could not be reached for comment. At the Florida rally on Thursday, Trump said he had been prepared for attacks, but I never knew it would be this vile, that it would be this bad, that it would be this vicious.  He said the corrupt political establishment was trying to stop him so it could carry out a program of radical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working people.     Our great civilization, here in America and across the civilized world has come upon a moment of reckoning, he said.  In the 2005 video, Trump bragged about groping women, kissing them without permission, and trying to seduce a married woman. He said during a presidential debate on Sunday that he had not actually done the things he had boasted about, and apologized for his remarks, which he called private locker room talk. The Washington Post endorsed Clinton on Thursday. In the gloom and ugliness of this political season, one encouraging truth is often overlooked: There is a well-qualified, well-prepared candidate on the ballot ... we endorse her without hesitation, it said.

Congressional race in Virginia shows Trump drag on Republicans,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Barbara Comstock is trying to untether herself from Donald Trump in her re-election bid for the U.S. Congress, but the Virginia Republicans struggles show how difficult that can be. Comstock represents a wealthy House of Representatives district in northern Virginia where Trump has become a burden, one that her opponent is wrapping around Comstocks neck. In local campaign ads, Democratic challenger LuAnn Bennett takes every opportunity to tie Comstock to the New York real estate developer and Republican presidential nominee. The strategy may be working. The Cook Political Report, a non-partisan election tipsheet, moved the Comstock-Bennett race from lean Republican to toss up on Wednesday, citing Trumps unpopularity in much of the district. This is despite Comstocks months-long effort to jettison Trump. In April, the former lobbyist and state legislator said Trump was actually a Democrat who knows nothing about the economy. She said in December that his plan to ban Muslim immigrants was un-American and a silly idea. In March, she gave campaign donations she got from Trump to charity. Earlier this month, she said Trumps boasts about groping women, revealed in a video tape, were vile. She said she would not vote for him and urged Trump to drop out of the race against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. But it may be too late to undo the damage, political analysts said, with just 19 days remaining until Election Day. In a normal year, Comstock would be a clear favorite, but right now her front runner status is in question because of Trump, said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabatos Crystal Ball at the Virginia Center for Politics.  He (Trump) was a gift to her campaign, said Bennett, a 63-year-old real estate executive. Bennett said Comstock, 57, waited too late in her re-election campaign to announce she would not vote for Trump, and argued that Comstocks views on immigration, abortion and climate change are shockingly similar to Trumps. Asked on Wednesday about voters view of her repudiation of Trump, Comstock said Bennett, if elected to the House, would be a rubber stamp for Clinton. Im the only one of the two of us who ... has a record of speaking out against people, whether its in my own party or not, Comstock, a Georgetown University-educated lawyer, told reporters after a debate with Bennett. Ive made clear that Im going to be my own woman. Stretching from suburban Washington to the Shenandoah valley and the West Virginia border, Comstocks district is home to thousands of government workers, as well as many well-heeled lobbyists and what Trump might call the Washington elites.  The area has been represented by a Republican in Congress since 1981, but has been a swing district in presidential years. Bennett said Democrats expect about 140,000 more voters to turn out in the district in this presidential election year than when Comstock was elected in a mid-term election two years ago. We have a growing Latino community, we have a growing Asian community, and those communities are very unsettled by the rhetoric theyve heard on the Republican side of the fence, and really worried about where this country is going, she said. Kondik said, This is one of the most highly educated districts in the country, and its filled with the kinds of Republicans that Trump could very well turn off. A recent poll by the Wason Center for Public Policy in Newport News, Virginia, showed Clinton leading Trump by 55 percent to 21 percent in northern Virginia. That suggests that for Comstock to win, some Clinton backers will need to split their tickets to vote for Comstock, who made a name for herself in the 1990s as a congressional staffer dedicated to investigating members of the Clinton administration. Stephen Farnsworth, professor of political science and international affairs at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia, said: With the lewd tape, Trump went from being a drag on the Comstock campaign to an anchor.

"Trump says he'll accept 'clear' election result, reserves right to challenge","DELAWARE, OHIO (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump on Thursday said he would accept a clear election result but reserved the right to file a legal challenge, clarifying his stance a day after he refused to promise he would trust the outcome if he loses on Nov. 8. Of course, I would accept a clear election result, but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result, Trump said at a rally in Ohio.

Trump's 'bad hombres' and 'nasty woman' remarks stoke online outrage,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump stirred social media ire on Wednesday after he said: We have some bad hombres here and referred to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton as such a nasty woman. The remarks during the third and final presidential debate came as Trump struggles to attract support from Latinos and women ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. During the face-off in Las Vegas, Trump repeated his call for tougher security at the Mexican border, saying: We have to keep the drugs out of our country. Adding he would also go after major drug dealers in the United States, he said: We have some bad hombres here and were going to get them out. Social media users quickly seized on the remark. This #BadHombres is the first of his family to graduate from college, did Americorps & taught in public schools, tweeted Jos N Miranda. Sometimes I forget this is a presidential debate and not an SNL (Saturday Night Live) skit #badhombres, wrote Twitter user Ian Mayberry. The term Bad Hombres became one of the most-discussed topics of the night on U.S. social media and was tweeted out about 134,000 times during and immediately after the debate, according to digital marketing technology company Amobee. Trump has aroused criticism for inflammatory comments about Mexican illegal immigrants during his presidential bid. During a speech to kick off his campaign in June 2015, Trump accused Mexico of sending rapists and other criminals to the United States. In late August, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto met with the Republican nominee and said later that Trumps policies could represent a huge threat to Mexico. Later in the debate, Trump interjected as Clinton said she would raise taxes on the wealthy to help fund the U.S. governments Social Security retirement program and that Trump would be paying higher taxes too unless he could get out of it. Such a nasty woman, he said.  The comment struck many online as sexist, with over 300,000 tweeting the phrase nasty woman by the early hours of Thursday. Calling someone a nasty woman on live television is so deeply and unbelievably offensive, tweeted Danielle Suchet.  What a nasty woman. That was the viscerally, awful, genuine part, wrote Jake Swanton. Trumps campaign was shaken by the recent release of a 2005 tape in which he boasted of kissing and touching women without their consent. Several women have since charged that he groped them, allegations he has described as absolutely false.

Women in Asia-Pacific express dismay over U.S. presidential campaign,"TOKYO/TAIPEI (Reuters) - Women in the Asia-Pacific region expressed dismay on Thursday about the U.S. presidential campaigns focus on the emotional topic of sexual harassment, saying it shows both democracy and the rights of women in America have some way to go. In a fiery final debate on Wednesday night in Las Vegas, Republican nominee Donald Trump accused Democrat rival Hillary Clintons campaign of orchestrating a series of accusations by women who said the businessman had made unwanted sexual advances.  Clinton, who would be Americas first female president, said the women came forward after Trump said he had never made unwanted advances on women. His denial came after a 2005 video surfaced earlier this month in which he was recorded bragging about groping women against their will. Hsiao Bi-khim, a lawmaker from Taiwans ruling Democratic Progressive Party, said she found it rather incredible Trump had survived politically in the face of the allegations. If a candidate in Taiwan was caught on tape making similar remarks, I dont think such a person would survive a presidential campaign, she said. Taiwan in January elected its first woman president, Tsai Ing-wen, and on gender equality at least, appears more advanced politically than the United States, she said. Not only have we elected a woman president, but we have a higher percentage of women who are independently involved in politics and in leadership positions, Hsiao said. Japans former minister for gender equality,Kuniko Inoguchi, said the rest of the world has been dismayed to see the U.S. campaign devolve into a downgraded debate on womens issues and it wouldnt be happening if Clinton were a man running for president. So when the glass ceiling breaks, there are a lot of injuries that a woman must bear, Inoguchi said. Mari Miura, a Sophia University political science professor specializing in womens issues, said Japanese politicians have also sparked outrage for comments demeaning women in the past. We hear such comments constantly from Japanese conservative men, she said. There are so many incidents that people get used to it and its easier to let it go. A study commissioned by Japans Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, published in March, found 28.7 percent of women had experienced some form of sexual harassment, and 40 percent of those said they had experienced unwanted touching. South Korea, which in 2012 elected its first woman president, Park Geun-hye, has slowly become more accepting of women politicians, said Park Young-sun, a female senior member of the Democratic Party of Korea, which has a majority in parliament. Park Young-sun said that when she first entered parliament, in 2004, female lawmakers were considered decorative items on display. They were given positions within the parties like flowers being placed decoratively here and there. Now its better.  Nurul Izzah, a Malaysian member of parliament and daughter of jailed opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, said the U.S. campaign debate was a tragedy for women everywhere. Nurul said there is a lot of condescension, prejudice in Malaysian politics, but political attacks are not really focused on gender-specific issues. A senior female member of Indonesian President Joko Widodos government said what Trump has been accused of doing with women would make him definitely unelectable in Indonesia. What shocks me is that many Americans still accept him and make excuses for him. She said sexual assault is not part of Indonesias political culture, and even if there are instances, it is not tolerated, and it doesnt sit well with either men or women. EVE-TEASING India, where sexual harassment and groping on public transport is known as Eve-teasing, went through its own soul-searching over the issue after the death of a young woman who was gang-raped on a moving bus in New Delhi in 2012. In our climate, a Donald Trump-like figure would have to apologize publicly, said Maya Mirchandani, foreign affairs editor at NDTV, a leading news channel. When she started in TV news in the 1990s, young female reporters were called soundbite soldiers, she said. Print journalists alleged that we used our bodies to stop politicians and get them to talk to us. Today, Indian law sets clear guidelines for companies to ensure harassment in the workplace is dealt with, she said. Even Australia, known for its colorful language and no-holds barred political culture, has been shocked by the U.S. presidential campaign, said Ged Kearney, female president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The closest Australia has come to anything similar recently was a ditch the witch campaign adopted by supporters of the conservative opposition against former prime minister Julia Gillard, Australias first prime minister, when she argued for a carbon tax during her time in power from 2010 to 2013. Personally, I think Donald Trump would definitely be unelectable in Australia, Kearney said. I dont think there is any place in Australia for that level of misogyny and cheapening of politics.

Clinton accuses Trump of being Putin's 'puppet',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton accused Republican presidential rival Donald Trump on Wednesday of being a puppet for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country has been accused by U.S. intelligence officials of meddling in the U.S. election. Putin has been repeatedly thrust into the campaign for the Nov. 8 U.S. election. Trump has praised him as a stronger leader than U.S. President Barack Obama, drawing criticism from Clinton and some Republicans that he is too cozy with the Russian president. Trump has also refused to concede that Russia was behind the hacking of Democratic Party emails. During Wednesdays presidential debate, Trump said he did not know Putin but would likely get along better with the Russian leader than Clinton, a former secretary of state. He said nice things about me, Trump said. He has no respect for her, he has no respect for our president and Ill tell you what, were in very serious trouble. Clinton responded: Well thats because hed rather have a puppet as president of the United States. No, youre the puppet, Trump retorted, adding Clinton disliked Putin because he has outsmarted her at every step of the way.  Earlier this week, Trump suggested that if elected, his first meeting with a foreign leader would be with Putin. U.S.-Russian relations have deteriorated in recent years over Moscows intervention in the Syrian conflict, its annexation of the Crimean region from Ukraine and concerns about cyber attacks. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who oversees 17 U.S. intelligence agencies, has suggested that recent computer hacks targeting the Democratic Party were perpetrated by Russians, and predicted that cyber attacks would be a pressing challenge for the next president. Putin said on Sunday that Russia did not seek confrontation with the United States and was not trying to influence the U.S. election. ",politicsNews,"October 20, 2016 ",1
Voters illegally removed from Ohio rolls may cast provisional ballots: judge,"(Reuters) - A federal judge in Ohio laid out a plan on Wednesday for the state to restore voting privileges for people who were illegally removed from the states voter rolls over the past five years. The ruling stems from a case in which the ACLU and other plaintiffs sued, saying Ohios process for removing people who had died or moved away from voter rolls was illegal because it purged people simply for not voting and not responding to a letter from the state. Voting rights cases have become pivotal battlegrounds ahead of the Nov. 8 election between Democrat Hillary Clinton and  Republican Donald Trump. The American Civil Liberties Union and others have challenged laws in Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina over voting rights issues. In the Ohio case, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati said Ohios process for removing inactive voters was illegal, reversing an earlier ruling by U.S. District Judge George C. Smith. In response, Smith on Wednesday ordered the state to allow people who had been removed from the rolls to cast provisional ballots on election day. Those ballots will be checked against voter rolls, and if people were purged in the years 2011, 2013 or 2015, their votes will be counted and their registration restored. Theyll have to put a provisional ballot which will take a little more time but if they do that, that vote will count, said Stuart Naifeh, an attorney with Demos, a voter rights and income inequality advocacy group that was among those suing over the policy. Joshua Eck, a spokesman for Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, said the solution was a workable one because it did not require the wholesale restoration of voting privileges to people who had moved away, died or otherwise become ineligible to vote.

"Before debate, protesters build 'wall of taco trucks' outside Trump hotel","LAS VEGAS - As Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump prepared to go head-to-head with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in their third and final debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday, hundreds of hospitality workers and protesters gathered outside the hotel Trump co-owns near the Las Vegas Strip.  Demonstrators waved signs and banners next to what organizers called a wall of taco trucks. That was a reference to Trumps proposal to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, as well as a riff on comments by Trump supporter Marco Gutierrez who said that without action on immigration reform, Youre going to have taco trucks on every corner. We have fought for our rights and we dont want Donald Trump to take them away from us, said Las Vegas resident Miguel Faria. If this man gets the presidency then everything will be ruined.  Several protesters wore sashes printed with the phrases Miss Piggy and Miss Housekeeping, using the names that Clinton has said Trump called a former beauty queen who had gained weight and who was Latina. The protest was organized by the Culinary Union, which represents about 57,000 workers in Nevada, the majority of whom are Latino. Luis Hernandez, a musician with the norteo band Los Tigres del Norte, encouraged Latino voters to head to the polls on Nov. 8.  We cant just go on hoping someone will vote on our behalf, he told Reuters. We need to go out and vote because the Hispanic vote is going to make the difference in these elections. Among the speakers at the protest was civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who said he hoped the candidates would stick to policies at Wednesdays debate, instead of attacking each other. We all as Americans live under one big tent. Hillary represents that higher ground. I hope that tonight they will not wallow in snake politics but will fly like eagles and take us all to higher ground, Jackson told Reuters.  According to Bethany Khan, the Culinary Unions communications director, workers at the Trump International Hotel voted to unionize in December 2015 but still do not have a contract.  Some protesters blamed that on Trump, who owns 50 percent of the property.  He says hes the greatest negotiator but hes not coming to the table to support the workers that give him money and make a profit for him, said Maria Teresa Liedermann.

North Carolina offers reward in arson at local Republican office,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - North Carolina will pay up to $5,000 for tips leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the weekend arson and graffiti attack at a local Republican Party headquarters, the states governor said on Wednesday. Local, state and federal investigators are searching for suspects after they said a device commonly described as a Molotov cocktail was thrown through a window of the Orange County Republican Party headquarters in Hillsborough on Sunday. The glass bottle containing a flammable liquid ignited inside the strip-mall office, burning furniture and campaign signs before extinguishing. A swastika and the message Nazi Republicans leave town or else were spray-painted on a nearby building. The firebombing of a local political headquarters was clearly an act of intimidation, and Im going to do everything I can to find the individual or individuals who committed this assault on our democracy, Republican Governor Pat McCrory said in a statement announcing the reward money. Investigators on Tuesday collected video from locations around the party office, according to a statement from Hillsborough, a town of about 6,400 people located 40 miles (65 km) from the state capital of Raleigh. Evidence from the crime scene is being analyzed at the FBIs laboratory in Quantico, Virginia. Mike Pence, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps running mate, called the incident an attack on the American political system during a visit to the scene Tuesday afternoon. Pence urged voters to help provide accountability at polling places when Americans turn out for the Nov. 8 election.  However, Pences remarks were well short of allegations by Trump in recent days that the race is being rigged against him at voting locations. Trump has provided no evidence for such assertions. North Carolinas State Board of Elections said in a statement later on Tuesday that officials had taken steps to protect the safety of voters, observers and poll workers during the voting process. Early voting begins in the state on Thursday. ",politicsNews,"October 19, 2016 ",1
"Rocky politics, slow growth loom as Obama, Italy's Renzi meet","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama welcomed Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to the White House on Tuesday, using the pomp of the formal state visit to highlight the link between the sluggish European economy and populist discontent in the continent. The spotlight comes at an opportune time for Renzi, who seeks a boost ahead of a constitutional referendum on Dec. 4 that could determine his political future. But even Renzi admitted that the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8 loomed larger. I have a feeling, and I think that rightly so, our American friends are a little more interested in November 8 than in the Italian vote on constitutional reform, and so are we, might I add, Renzi said, drawing laughter from the Rose Garden press conference. Obama slammed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump for whining that the U.S. election was rigged. He praised Renzis proposed economic reforms and said he supported the attempt to modernize political institutions at the referendum because it would help accelerate economic changes. I do believe that there is a connection between stagnation and some of the less constructive, populist impulses that have been rising up, Obama said, saying more jobs needed to be created for Europes younger generation. This is the second time this year Obama has weighed in on domestic political battles facing his European allies. In April, he visited London in support of former Prime Minister David Camerons unsuccessful efforts to persuade Britain to vote to remain in the European Union. On Tuesday he said he expected Renzi to stay in office for some time. As you fight for the cause of reform, know that we stand with you. I believe that Italy and the world will continue to benefit from your leadership for many years to come, Obama said during a toast at the state dinner.  The leaders discussed the fight against Islamic State and the battle to take the Iraqi city of Mosul from the militant group, something Obama called a key milestone. Obama insisted the U.S.-led coalition had an extensive strategy to deal with what could be heart-breaking humanitarian consequences of the fight. The state dinner was the last scheduled for Obama before he leaves office in January. Notable guests included former racing driver Mario Andretti, designer Giorgio Armani, actor Roberto Benigni and celebrity chef Mario Batali, who helped plan and cook the meal.

Trump's appeal for poll monitors draws tepid response from some supporters,"SHERMANS DALE, Penn. (Reuters) - While Donald Trump often rails against a rigged election on Twitter and at rallies nationwide, he goes a few steps further in Pennsylvania, a state crucial to the Republicans fading chances to win the White House. Here, he has made direct appeals since August to recruit voters as poll monitors on Election Day and has pointed specifically at Philadelphia as a city beset by voter fraud. Despite offering little evidence for any of his claims, his rigged election message is resonating with his followers in this traditional battleground state where Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has opened up a wide lead. But his calls for poll watchers on Nov. 8 is drawing a mix of confusion, concern and tepid support. In some cases, Trumps talk of fraud appears to have made some of his own followers more resigned to an election loss, even though independent studies show U.S. voting chicanery is exceptionally rare and certainly never on a national scale. Since Aug. 8, when Trump first urged supporters in the state to watch other polling places and make sure that its 100-percent fine, civil rights groups have expressed fears that some supporters will take the idea too far by forming roaming, vigilante-style crowds intimidating voters. Trump supporter Mark Bowman, 53, says he isnt the type to attend a political rally or put campaign stickers on his car. And he isnt confident the election results will be correct. I hate to say it, but I dont have a lot of faith, Bowman said. Voter fraud is rampant especially in the cities. But, in a comment echoed by nearly two dozen Trump supporters in the states reliably Republican central regions, he said he thinks nothing can be done to stop it and that becoming an amateur poll watcher is a step too far. What authority do I have to confront someone? said the resident of Shermans Dale, a rural community of about 5,000 people. Your average citizen, youre going to end up in a confrontation with someone. Youre going to end up in a bad situation. There are official channels to monitor elections. Pennsylvania has a system that allows campaigns and political parties to designate official poll monitors, who are allowed into the polling places and can register official complaints if they think someone isnt a valid voter. A form on the Trump campaigns website asks voters to help Trump stop crooked Hillary from rigging this election by becoming a volunteer Trump election observer. But in an example of the Trump campaigns near non-existent effort to organize field operations in key swing states, there is little evidence that the recruitment drive is translating into legions of officially sanctioned volunteers. Repeated inquiries from Reuters about efforts to staff polling places went unanswered by his campaign. The rules allow each candidate and the state parties to name monitors. With federal and local candidates both on the November ballot, there could be dozens of watchers in a single precinct. But those familiar with past elections say rarely does that happen. Instead, campaigns tend to focus on only the most fought over swing districts. Steve Reigh, 57, a realtor from Elliottsburg, Pennsylvania, agrees with Trump that the election is likely to be rigged, but says he also resigned to the outcome of the election, win or lose. What are you going to do? he said. Some Trump supporters are branching out on their own. Jack Posobiec, a navy veteran and special projects director at Citizens for Trump, a grassroots support group, says he hopes to mobilize 3,000 volunteers in several key swing states in the final days of the campaign, including busing supporters from Texas to Ohio. On Oct. 1, Trump told a largely white rally of supporters in Manheim in central Pennsylvania that they should go to neighborhoods other than their own on election day and watch. Youve got to get everybody you know and you got to watch your polling booths, because I hear too many stories about Pennsylvania, certain areas, Trump said. So go and vote and then go and check out areas because a lot of bad things happen and we dont want to lose for that reason. Dale Ho, a voting rights lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, said on Twitter that Trumps calls for poll watchers were a recipe for intimidation and discrimination. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.     Married Trump supporters Gina, 75, and Larry Snyder, 77, of Newport agree the election could be rigged but doubt anything can be done about it, including poll-watching. Candace Lowe, 40, of Elliottsburg, Pennsylvania, said she is resigned to a Trump loss because the government can fudge stuff. Turning out en-masse to watch polling centers on election night wont change that, she said. In Mechanicsburg, an overwhelmingly Republican borough of nearly 9,000 people, realtor Steve Johansen helped to set up a Trump field office in a skating rink, but he has no plans to monitor any polling places. I have faith in the system, he said. ",politicsNews,"October 19, 2016 ",1
"Trump? Clinton? Many young Americans prefer giant meteor, poll finds"," (The 18 October 2016 story was refiled to correct the typo in the last sentence to read likely voters) By Scott Malone BOSTON (Reuters) - Young Americans are so dissatisfied with their choices in this presidential election that nearly one in four told an opinion poll they would rather have a giant meteor destroy the Earth than see Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton in the White House. The tongue-in-cheek question was intended to gauge young Americans level of unhappiness about their choices in the Nov. 8 election, said Joshua Dyck, co-director of UMass Lowells Center for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll alongside Odyssey, a social media platform. The choice alluded to the Twitter hashtag #GiantMeteor2016, a reference to an imaginary presidential candidate used to express frustration about this years election choices. Some 53 percent of the 1,247 people aged 18 to 35 said they would prefer to see a meteor destroy the world than have Republican New York real estate developer Trump in the Oval Office, with some 34 percent preferring planetary annihilation to seeing the Democratic former Secretary of State win. Some 39 percent said they would prefer that U.S. President Barack Obama declare himself president for life than hand over power to Clinton or Trump, with 26 percent saying the nation would do better to select its next leader in a random lottery. Some 23 percent, nearly one in four, preferred the giant meteor outcome to either Trump or Clinton. Obviously we dont think that theyre serious, Dyck said in a phone interview on Tuesday. The fact that one in four of our young people pick Giant Meteor tells you something about the political disaffection that is being shown by American youth. That contrasts with the surge of participation by young voters that helped propel Obama into the White House for his first term in the 2008 election. When asked to choose between the actual candidates, Clinton easily led Trump with 54 percent of respondents to 21 percent in a two-way race. In a four-way race also including Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Clinton led with 48 percent support, to Trumps 20 percent, Johnsons 10 percent and Steins 4 percent. In national polls surveying the whole population, Clinton is leading Trump, but not by nearly as much. The poll, conducted Oct. 10-13, intentionally included a large number of people seen as unlikely to vote, with just 680 described as likely voters. It had a margin of error of 3.2 percent.

Obama tells Trump to 'stop whining' over rigged election claims,"WASHINGTON/GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama lacerated Donald Trump on Tuesday over his repeated assertions that the Nov. 8 election is rigged against him, telling the Republican presidential candidate to stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes. With opinion polls showing him falling further back against his White House rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump has intensified his allegations, although numerous studies have shown that voter fraud in U.S. elections is rare. At a campaign rally in Grand Junction, Colorado, Trump continued his attack, saying, The press has created a rigged system and poisoned the minds of the voters. But he also used his speech to detail a new initiative if elected president: a constitutional amendment imposing term limits for members of Congress, six years for members of the House of Representatives, 12 years for members of the Senate. Obama was asked about Trumps voter fraud assertions on Tuesday at a joint news conference in the White House Rose Garden following meetings with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. He responded with a blistering attack on the Republican candidate, noting that U.S. elections are run and monitored by local officials, who may well be appointed by Republican governors of states, and saying that cases of significant voter fraud were not to be found in American elections. Obama said there was no serious person who would suggest it was possible to rig American elections, adding, Id invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes. Trump, speaking at the Grand Junction rally Tuesday evening, said that Obama should stop campaigning for Crooked Hillary and get out and work on jobs and work on the border. Trump has raised the possibility for weeks of illegal activities that could tarnish the November election result, citing scant or questionable evidence, including the possibility of votes being cast by dead people, and he has urged his supporters to show up at polling locations on Election Day. He has sharpened his allegations even as Republican lawyers called his assertions unfounded. In a report titled The Truth About Voter Fraud, the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law cited voter fraud incident rates between 0.00004 percent and 0.0009 percent. An August study by the Washington Post found 31 credible cases of impersonation fraud out of more than 1 billion votes cast in elections from 2000 to 2014. Arizona State University studies in 2012 and 2016 found similarly low rates. In pointed remarks that were part civics lesson, Obama said that if Trump wins on Nov. 8, It would be my expectation of Hillary Clinton to offer a gracious concession speech and it would be my job ... and escort him over to the Capitol, in which there would be a peaceful transfer of power at his swearing in. Trumps vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, took a softer tone than Trump during a campaign appearance in North Carolina, saying he was confident that the integrity of the election will be ensured. But Pence added that in recent years weve had instances, proven instances of voter fraud. A number of Republican-led states, citing the need to prevent voter fraud, have passed laws with stricter identification requirements. But several have been struck down by courts that ruled they were designed to hinder minority voting.   Trump trails Clinton by 7 points in national opinion polls, according to an average of polls compiled by RealClear Politics. Over the last few weeks, Trump, who has never previously run for office, has been embroiled in one controversy after another, eclipsing policy issues such as taxes, trade, the economy and national security that normally dominate the final push in presidential campaigns. With three weeks left until Election Day and early voting both by mail and in person already under way in many states, Trump has been grappling with the fallout from the release earlier this month of a 2005 videotape in which he was heard bragging about groping women and making other unwanted sexual advances. He has said the remarks were just locker room talk and has strongly denied allegations by a string of women who have come forward since the video emerged to say Trump groped or touched them inappropriately, denouncing his accusers as liars and fame-seekers. The controversies will be the backdrop for the third and final of three presidential debates, to be held on Wednesday evening in Las Vegas. Trump was widely viewed as having been on the defensive during the first debate. He appeared to have improved his performance in the second debate, but according to polling, more voters saw Clinton as the victor. Wednesdays debate, like the first one, will be a traditional format with the moderator posing all the questions. Topics chosen by moderator Chris Wallace include debt and entitlements, immigration, the economy, the Supreme Court, foreign hot spots, and fitness to be president.  At Tuesdays press conference, Obama also criticized Trump for his continued flattery of Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying it is out of step with the country. Trump has praised Putin as a strong leader and on Monday suggested that if he wins next month he might meet the Russian leader before he is even sworn in as president.

U.S. civil rights groups to fan out on Nov. 8 to fight voter intimidation,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump supporters who plan to stake out polling sites on Election Day may find their own activities tracked closely by thousands of civil-rights activists who are mounting a nationwide effort to prevent problems at the polls. The Republican presidential candidate, who has repeatedly said that the election is rigged, has urged his backers to monitor voting sites for evidence of fraud, raising concerns that overzealous supporters could intimidate voters in the Nov. 8 election. They will not be the only ones out in force on Election Day. Civil rights groups say they plan to deploy thousands of volunteers on the ground in 27 states to ensure that voters will not be turned away by harassment, long lines or confusing rules. Teams of lawyers will file legal challenges if necessary. While previous elections have been marred by irregularities, Trumps rhetoric might lead to greater problems at the polls this year, activists say. When Trump says, Go and watch certain areas of Philadelphia, thats either intentionally reckless or its a thinly veiled call to engage in racial profiling, said Dale Ho, the head of the American Civil Liberties Unions voting rights project. Whether people will heed it, I dont know. Non-partisan groups have mounted election protection programs since the disputed Bush-Gore presidential election of 2000, but they faced a more daunting landscape this year even before Trump began warning of a rigged election.  The Supreme Court in 2013 weakened the U.S. governments ability to monitor voting activity in states with a history of racial discrimination, and dozens of Republican-led states have also passed laws that require voters to present photo identification or that restrict voting in other ways. As early voting gets underway in many states, voting-rights groups are publicizing a national hotline, 866-OUR-VOTE, and establishing lines of communication with the election officials who are tasked with resolving problems. We havent encountered a situation yet where we feel theres a need to call the police, said Marcia Johnson-Blanco, a co-director of the voting rights project at the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. This year, civil-rights groups are broadening their efforts beyond perpetual battlegrounds like Ohio and Florida to conservative states like Texas, where they plan to field 200 volunteers to monitor polling sites in Houstons Harris County. Weve seen an uptick of folks saying theyre going to be out patrolling in a way that we think is trying to be intimidating, said Zenen Jaimes Perez, communications director for the Texas Civil Rights Project.  In New York, volunteers with Common Cause are expanding their monitoring programs to Muslim neighborhoods in New York City and some areas of the rural Hudson Valley. What Trumps efforts have caused us here in New York to think about are places where there are concentrations of voters who, I hate to say, are easy targets - a magnet for people who are extreme, said Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York. Democratic officials have stepped up their efforts as well. In Arizona, a traditionally Republican state that is competitive this year, Democrats plans to deploy a record 200 lawyers to make sure that everybody who is in line when polls close at 7 p.m. will get a chance to cast a ballot, said Spencer Scharff, the state partys voter protection director. But at the end of the day, poll monitors do not have the power to fix problems - they can only point them out to election officials. States have the most important role. Theyre the ones who write these laws and they have to enforce these laws, said Danielle Davis, a staff attorney at the Advancement Project, a national civil-rights group.

Michael Moore to release anti-Trump film as celebs step up Clinton support,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Michael Moore, the left-wing filmmaker known for provocative documentaries that deliver a biting message, will release an anti-Donald Trump movie on Tuesday as Hollywood ramps up efforts to support Democratic White House contender Hillary Clinton in the final weeks of the 2016  election campaign. Moore, the Oscar-winning maker of documentaries about guns, the Iraq war and the U.S. health system, said on Twitter he would release Michael Moore in Trumpland in a free screening in Manhattan on Tuesday night at one movie theater, followed by commercial release in theaters in Los Angeles and New York on Wednesday. The films release comes three weeks before the Nov. 8 election. The film is based on a one-man show, October Surprise,  that Moore, a vocal critic of the Republican presidential contender, recently performed in Ohio and shows Moore dive right into hostile territory, according to a brief description. The film is being released as scores of celebrities rally round Clinton ahead of the Nov. 8 election. More than 30, including Barbra Streisand, Billy Crystal, Julia Roberts, Helen Mirren and Lena Dunham, staged a fundraising show on Broadway on Monday with tickets that sold for up $10,000 each and which was streamed live online. Singer Jennifer Lopez and rocker Jon Bon Jovi will play separate Get Out The Vote gigs in Florida next week on behalf of Clintons campaign. Iron Man star Robert Downey Jr. and actors Neil Patrick Harris, Don Cheadle and Julianne Moore are among those asking Americans to save the day in a social media campaign aimed at getting people to vote against Republican businessman and former reality star Trump. Clinton counts more, and more vocal, celebrity supporters than Trump, whose backers include Clint Eastwood, Jon Voight, country singer Loretta Lynn, Kirstie Alley and rapper Azealia Banks. But fans of celebrities are not necessarily fans of the candidate they support. Comedian Amy Schumer was booed at her stand-up show in Florida on Sunday after she attacked Trump and Republican voters, causing some 200 audience members to walk out, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

Arizona execution procedures face review in U.S. court,"(Reuters) - A federal judge in Phoenix will hear arguments this week about resuming executions in Arizona, where a 2014 lethal injection that took nearly two hours raised questions about the states death chamber protocols and the chemicals it uses to kill inmates. The case is the latest to challenge the drugs used in many states to execute prisoners, and may wind up putting the issue back for review by the U.S. Supreme Court. Arizona last year changed its lethal injection procedures following the troubled 2014 execution of Joseph Wood, but lawyers for seven Arizona death row inmates contend new guidelines and drugs will violate U.S. constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. One issue at the hearing set for Wednesday in U.S. district court will be the sedative midazolam, a valium-like drug critics contend does not achieve the level of unconsciousness required for surgery and is therefore unsuitable for executions. The drug was used in Woods execution along with a narcotic, hydromorphone. He was seen gasping for air during a nearly two-hour procedure where he received 15 rounds of drug injections. Lethal injections are supposed to result in death in a matter of minutes. Under the new protocols, Arizona has listed one mix where it will use midazolam along with a drug that causes paralysis and another that stops the heart. A similar combination was used in Oklahoma, which had a troubled execution where an inmate was seen twisting on a death chamber gurney. The state said in court papers filed late on Monday it intends to revise its protocols and remove midazolam as an option, pledging not to use it even if it becomes available. It has three other options for lethal injection mixes that do not use the drug in the new protocols.  Lawyers for the inmates contend the source of the drugs and their purity have been cloaked in secrecy, since European makers and U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc halted sales of drugs used in executions to prison systems in recent years.  As a result, states have turned to lightly regulated compounding pharmacies that mix chemicals. The few states that have obtained lethal injection drugs since then have kept the names of their suppliers confidential. The lawyers want to put future executions on hold while the court reviews the protocols. Officials in Arizona have fought tooth and nail to protect that secrecy, which, along with the use of an experimental drug combination, only serves to increase the risk of more problematic executions, said Dale Baich, an attorney for the inmates. The state contends its protocols correct previous problems and it should be permitted to implement capital punishment. Victims and state governments have rights and interests, too, including an important interest in the timely enforcement of a sentence and the states interest to enforce its own laws, David Weinzweig argued on behalf of Arizona at a hearing this year.

Pro-Trump group ad seeks to pit Michelle Obama against Clinton," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Super PAC backing Republican Donald Trump is buying TV airtime in parts of Florida beginning this week for a commercial aimed at using first lady Michelle Obamas words against Hillary Clinton to erode the Democratic presidential candidates support from women voters in the battleground state.  The ad  which the Super PAC has already been running online  shows Michelle Obama in 2007 saying, If you cant run your own house, you cant run the White House, which could be taken as a reference to infidelity by Clintons husband, Bill Clinton.  The ad says Michelle Obama was talking about Hillary Clinton. However, at the time, then-candidate Barack Obama denied that his wifes words referred to his opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination.  Representatives for Clinton and Michelle Obama declined to comment on the commercial.  The Super PAC, Make America Number 1, is hoping the ad, to be aired in the Orlando and Tampa areas, will resonate with women, a spokesman, Hogan Gidley, told Reuters on Tuesday.  Trump has struggled for support from women voters, many of whom have cited his temperament and past negative comments about women, including comedian Rosie ODonnell and Fox News host Megyn Kelly.  Eleven days ago, the New York businessmans campaign was shaken by the release of a tape showing Trump lewdly bragging about kissing and touching women without their permission. A series of women have since come forward with allegations about such behavior on his part, but he has denied the accusations.  In Florida, a Quinnipiac University poll released on Monday found Clinton leading among likely women voters, with support from 54 percent of those surveyed, compared with 39 percent for Trump.  Michelle Obama has become one of the most powerful campaigners for Clinton. A speech the first lady gave in New Hampshire last week attacking Trump for the tape was praised by many as one of the most powerful speeches of the campaign.  Make America Number 1 plans to spend $400,000 to put the ad on TV, spokesman Gidley said.  In addition to the TV run, the commercial initially appeared as a Facebook ad. The group spent $72,000 targeting women in nine key battleground states - states where the vote could swing to either candidate.  Super PACs - or super political action committees - are permitted to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money, but are prohibited by law from coordinating with a campaign. Make America Number 1 is one of a handful of such groups supporting Trumps White House bid.  Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton have never directly addressed how they mended their relationship after the fierce 2008 primary campaign, in which Clinton lost to now-President Barack Obama. Both Obamas have campaigned aggressively for Clinton this year.  During last weeks second presidential debate, Clinton called Michelle Obama my friend.  ",politicsNews,"October 18, 2016 ",1
Obama says Trump embrace of Russian president 'unprecedented',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said Donald Trumps embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin was unprecedented and said he was troubled that other Republicans were supporting the Republican presidential candidates positions on Russia. Mr. Trumps continued flattery of Mr. Putin and the way he appears and the degree to which he appears to model many of his policies and approaches to politics on Mr. Putin is unprecedented in American politics, Obama said at a White House news conference with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. Saying Mr. Trump rarely surprises me these days, Obama said he was much more concerned to see support for the candidates stance on Putin and Russia from Republican officials who historically had been anti-Russia. Historically, Republican politicians have often taken or appeared to take a harder line on Russias predecessor, the Soviet Union, the United States Cold War foe. Obama said Russias behavior has undermined international norms and said any suggestion that the United States has encroached on Russian interests is wrong. We think that Russia is a large, important country with a military that is second only to ours and has to be a part of the solution on the world stage rather than part of the problem, Obama said. But their behavior has undermined international norms and international rules in ways we have to call them out on, Obama said, citing Russian aggression in Ukraine and other actions. Russia has been internationally condemned for its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and its support of pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. ",politicsNews,"October 18, 2016 ",1

It is a strategic interest of the United States to make sure that the migration crisis thats been taking place in Europe is solved, Obama told reporters following a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi at the White House.

Top Republican pledges to maintain Cuba trade embargo,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Republican in the U.S. Congress dimmed hopes that lawmakers might end the embargo on Cuba after President Barack Obama leaves office, saying on Tuesday he intends to keep the trade restrictions in place. As the past two years of normalizing relations have only emboldened the regime at the expense of the Cuban people, I fully intend to maintain our embargo on Cuba, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement. The Obama administration has been easing restrictions on dealings with Cuba since the surprise announcement in 2014 by Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro that the long-time foes would move toward more normal relations. On Friday, the White House announced new measures to further ease trade, travel and financial restrictions, including allowing American travelers to bring home more of the countrys coveted cigars and rum.  But the half-century-long embargo can only be lifted fully by Congress, which is controlled by Ryans Republicans. While some join most of Obamas fellow Democrats in backing the new policies, party leaders have opposed legislation to ease restrictions. Some lawmakers had hoped attitudes in Congress might soften after Obama leaves office in January, even if Democrats do not win majorities in the House and Senate, especially with Americans accustomed to two years of freer travel and business. Cuban relations often come to the fore during U.S. election campaigns. Pro-embargo Cuban-Americans are an important Republican voting bloc in Florida, which often has close congressional races and is one of the swing states that can decide presidential elections. Ryan termed Obamas actions efforts to appease the oppressive regime in Cuba. He said they would strengthen its government and endanger U.S. companies intellectual property rights. Backers of Obamas policy say half a century of restrictions on trade and travel have not ended Cuban communism, and are not worth denying U.S. citizens freedom of travel and U.S. companies the chance to do business there.

I have never seen in my lifetime, or in modern political history, any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place. Its unprecedented, the Democratic president said.

Ex-Red Sox pitcher mulls run against Senator Warren in Massachusetts,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Former Boston Red Sox pitcher, failed video game entrepreneur and conservative political commentator Curt Schilling said on Tuesday he is considering running against Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in 2018. Ive made my decision. Im going to run, Schilling said during an interview on WPRO-AM radio in Providence, Rhode Island, about 40 miles from Boston. He added that the decision would be contingent on his wifes approval. Ultimately its going to come down to how her and I feel this would affect our marriage and our kids. Schilling also fielded phone calls from listeners about a $75 million loan the state of Rhode Island made in 2010 to his video game company, 38 Studios, which went bankrupt in 2012. Im sorry it ended the way it did, Schilling said, adding that if he had been governor of Rhode Island he would not have offered financing to that company. Schilling is still warmly remembered by Red Sox fans for undergoing a medical procedure that allowed him to pitch with an injured ankle and blood-stained sock during the American League Championship Series and World Series in 2004, helping the team win its first world series championship since 1918. Despite being associated with a team from a politically liberal state, Schilling has long backed conservative politicians, most recently Republican presidential contender Donald Trump.

"Congressional Republicans want to talk Tehran, not Trump","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. congressional candidates worried that Donald Trumps struggling White House bid will damage them too have seized on one of President Barack Obamas signature foreign policy initiatives to try to ward off Democrats in the Nov 8 elections. With control of the Senate and perhaps even the House of Representatives in the balance, millions of dollars has been spent on campaign advertisements criticizing last years Iran nuclear pact, even in districts where foreign affairs generally are not a top concern. Although Iran is unlikely to be most voters main reason for choosing a candidate, strategists said the money could be well spent.  Iran provides a distraction for Republicans concerned that the unpopularity of Trump  whose poll numbers are dropping as he fights off several allegations that he groped women  could also sink party members further down the ballot. One typical ad, for Iowa Republican Representative Rod Blum, uses apocalyptic imagery to tie Democratic challenger Monica Vernon to the Iran agreement. Would you give billions to an Islamic Republic that burns our flag and chants Death to America? Monica Vernon would, a male voice thunders over a video montage of marching troops, nuclear weapons and protesters burning U.S. flags. Vernon, a member of the Cedar Rapids City Council, has voiced support for the nuclear deal. Blums spot is similar to dozens rolled out on behalf of Republican candidates who argue that Americas influence is weaker because of Obama and by extension Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state who is now the Democratic presidential nominee.         Iran is a piece of the national security anxiety people feel, Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak said. Foreign policys really complicated. Average voters dont understand it, dont follow it closely, but they know what bad foreign policy looks like. The agreement between Iran, the United States and other world powers curbs Tehrans nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief and the release of frozen Iranian assets. Trump frequently criticizes the accord and promises to make much better deals, based on his business experience, if he wins the White House. The real estate magnate has hammered the Iran pact in both of his presidential debates with Clinton and it is likely to come up at Wednesdays third debate in Nevada. Reuters/Ipsos polling in May showed Americans preferred Republicans plans for dealing with Iran by 37 percent versus 21.9 percent for the Democrats. Every Republican in Congress opposed the Iran breakthrough. Many worried that Obama gave up too much to a country that sponsors terrorism and threatens Israel. The issue has become more politicized recently, as congressional Republicans denounced the release of cash to Iran as a ransom payment and charged that huge Boeing Co and Airbus contracts to sell Iran jetliners could support terrorism. In the race for a U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina on Nov. 8, a conservative spending group spent $1 million on advertising attacking Deborah Ross, the Democrat running against incumbent Senator Richard Burr, over the Iran deal. Israel also opposed the Iran accord, as did AIPAC, the main U.S. pro-Israel lobby group. Support for Israel is important to voters, especially evangelical Christians who are a wellspring of Republican support. There is more election advertising opposing the Iran deal than supporting it, but there is some backing for it. J Street, a smaller liberal pro-Israel group, spent $500,000 on advertising attacking Republican Senators Patrick Toomey and Ron Johnson, in tight re-election races in Democratic-leaning Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, for opposing the Iran pact.

Trump sharpens 'rigged' election allegations disputed by Republican lawyers,"GREEN BAY, Wis./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Monday cited studies he said showed rampant voter fraud, saying the Nov. 8 election was rigged against him even as Republican lawyers called his allegations unfounded. Trump, a New York businessman making his first run for public office, has sought to raise fears of a flawed election as he has fallen in opinion polls against Democrat Hillary Clinton. They even want to try to rig the election at the polling place, Trump told a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin. So many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is very, very common. Trump cited Pew Trusts research from 2012 that called for updates to the voter registration system because about 24 million registrations were inaccurate. (bit.ly/1HN4uTF) He also referred to a 2014 article by two political scientists in the Washington Post that said non-citizens who voted could have accounted for Democratic victories in a few close elections in 2008, although the authors acknowledged the sample size of their study was small. (wapo.st/1pX17Bf) Numerous studies have shown that voter fraud in U.S. elections is very rare. Republican campaign lawyer Chris Ashby said Trumps charges could foment unrest and were unfounded and dangerous. When you say an election is rigged, youre telling voters, your supporters, their votes do not matter, Ashby said in an interview. I think some of Donald Trumps comments could cause unrest at the polls. Some Republicans have urged Trump to drop the assertions. Early voting and voting by mail have already begun in many states. Mark Braden, partner at Baker and Hostetler and former chief counsel for the Republican National Committee, said that any sort of election rigging at the national level just is impossible, citing the various systems in place that would make such an endeavor complicated and unfeasible.  Our system is principally a system based upon each side watching the other side, Braden said in an interview. Our system is dependent on local volunteer participation. Our system has worked very well because we have people who get involved in the process and perform these functions. Trump also pounced on the release on Monday of Federal Bureau of Investigation documents that he alleged showed felony corruption. The documents cited an FBI official as saying a senior State Department official sought to pressure the bureau in 2015 to drop its insistence that an email from Clintons private server contained classified information.. Clintons decision to use a private server while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 has drawn criticism that she was careless with national security. This is worse than Watergate, whats going on with this, said Trump. He also proposed a package of ethics reforms, saying that if elected he would ban his administration officials from lobbying government for five years after leaving government. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said Trumps assault on the voting system was an act of desperation. He knows hes losing and is trying to blame that on the system. This is what losers do, Mook told reporters. The RealClearPolitics average of national opinion polls shows Clinton currently leading Trump by 7.1 percentage points, at 46 percent to 38.9 percent. The countrys top elected Republican, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, tried to counter Trumps message about election fraud. Spokeswoman AshLee Strong said Ryan is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity.  In the traditionally hard-fought state of Ohio, the top elections official, a Republican, said concerns about widespread voter fraud were simply not justified.  I can reassure Donald Trump: I am in charge of elections in Ohio and theyre not going to be rigged, Ill make sure of that, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted told CNN.  In a report titled The Truth About Voter Fraud, the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law cited voter fraud incident rates between 0.00004 percent and 0.0009 percent. An August study by the Washington Post found 31 credible cases of impersonation fraud out of more than 1 billion votes cast in elections from 2000 to 2014. Arizona State University studies in 2012 and 2016 found similarly low rates. A number of Republican-led states, citing the need to prevent voter fraud, have passed laws with stricter ID requirements. But several have been struck down by courts that ruled they were designed to hinder minority voting. Trumps campaign has been shaken since the release 10 days ago of a 2005 tape showing him lewdly bragging about kissing and touching women without their permission. A series of women have since come forward with allegations about such behavior on his part, but he has denied those accusations. They want to put nice sexy headlines up even though nothing happened, Trump said, blaming the media for trying to poison the minds of the voters. On Monday, the allegations were in the headlines again after Trumps wife, Melania Trump, spoke publicly for the first time about the Access Hollywood tape. A former model who has mainly stayed off the campaign trail, Trump told CNN she was surprised by her husbands language and said she thought he had been egged on to say dirty and bad stuff, calling it boy talk.  Melania Trump told CNN that the allegations of unwanted touching from women were all organized from the opposition and said media did not check the background of these women. In a separate interview with Fox News Channel, she said she had forgiven her husband for the comments in the tape. Those words, they were offensive to me and they were inappropriate. And he apologized to me, Melania Trump said in an excerpt released by Fox News Channel. I accept his apology. And we are moving on, she said. ",politicsNews,"October 17, 2016 ",1
Melania Trump calls taped comments by Donald Trump 'boy talk',"(Reuters) - Melania Trump rose to her husbands defense on Monday, describing lewd comments the Republican presidential nominee made on a leaked 2005 video in which he bragged about groping women as boy talk.      Trump, who has kept a low profile during her husbands presidential bid, gave her first television interviews since the Oct. 7 release of the tape that has shaken Donald Trumps campaign. He trails Democrat Hillary Clinton in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Melania Trump told CNN her husband was engaged in boy talk, and he was led on - like, egged on - from the host to say dirty and bad stuff in the conversation with Access Hollywood host Billy Bush.  NBC said on Monday that Bush was leaving the Today show, following his role in the taped conversation with Donald Trump. Melania Trump, a Slovenian-born former model, added in a CNN interview that aired on Monday night that she was surprised because she had never heard her husband use that kind of language before.   No. No, thats why I was surprised, because I said like I dont know that person that would talk that way, and that he would say that kind of stuff in private, Melania Trump said.  She told CNN that her husband behaved at times like an overgrown boy and that she saw his Access Hollywood remarks as in keeping with that behavior. Sometimes I say I have two boys at home. I have my young son and I have my husband. But I know how some men talk, and thats how I saw it, yes, she said.  Trump told CNN she agreed with first lady Michelle Obama that kissing or groping someone without consent constituted sexual assault, adding: But every assault should be taken care of in a court of law. And to accuse, no matter who it is, a man or a woman, without evidence is damaging and unfair. In partial transcripts from a separate interview with Fox News, she said she had forgiven her husband for the comments in the tape, which was first published by the Washington Post. Those words, they were offensive to me and they were inappropriate.And he apologized to me.And I ... accept his apology. And we are moving on. They were her first public comments since a statement she issued after the tapes publication in which she said her husbands remarks did not represent the man that I know. Melania Trump told Fox News that her husband, a New York businessman and former reality television star, was committed to running for office even though it was difficult because he had been in so many shows, so many tapes over the years. Asked if it was fair for the media or her husband to bring up charges of infidelity in former President Bill Clintons past, Melania Trump told Fox News: Well, if they bring up my past, why not? After Trump denied during a debate with Clinton on Oct. 9 that he had actually done the things he bragged about in the tape, a number of women accused him of groping and kissing them without permission in incidents stretching back decades. He has denied the charges.  Asked about those accusations, Melania Trump told Fox News: All these women are coming out and they are allegations but they are not true. Why now? Why three weeks before the election? I believe my husband, she told CNN. This was all organized from the opposition. With the details that they got, did they ever check the background of these women? They dont have any facts. ",politicsNews,"October 18, 2016 ",1
"Rejecting Trump, Wall Street Republican donors scatter largesse","NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Largely united in their dislike of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, some ultra-wealthy U.S. investors who play in conservative politics are warily weighing their choices, torn between third-party candidates, simply focusing on down-ballot contests or even voting for Democrat Hillary Clinton. As Clintons lead over Trump has grown in opinion polls, some hedge fund managers who have traditionally donated big money to Republican presidential candidates see the congressional elections as their best hope. Stanley Druckenmiller, one of the best-performing hedge fund managers of all time, told Reuters he had recently given to Republican candidates for Congress in the hope of creating a firewall against Clintons economic policies, including more government control of healthcare and what he described as astronomical disincentives to invest. Druckenmiller, who invests privately since closing his hedge fund firm in 2010, said Trump had an unstable personality that ruled him out as a candidate. I might just vote on the down ballot part of the ticket and not bother with the top, he said. Public filings show Druckenmiller donated to U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in August and the National Republican Congressional Committee in March. He disavowed long-shot Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, saying he was out the window after a couple of high-profile lapses on foreign affairs, including struggling to name an international leader he admired. But some Republican hedge fund managers contacted by Reuters said they planned to vote for Johnson, who is polling in the single digits. Among them is Tiger Management founder Julian Robertson, according to spokesman Fraser Seitel. Robertson previously backed Republicans Jeb Bush and John Kasich. Ive heard from a lot of people who say theyll vote for Johnson or not vote at all because they dont want to be held responsible for having elected Hillary Clinton, one hedge fund billionaire said in describing industry views. The person, who requested anonymity because they did not want their political views to be public, plans to vote for Clinton. The person believes Clinton is the lesser of two evils and that no vote, or one for someone else, could help Trump. Other conservative investors focused on congressional races instead of the next president include Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management and Paul Singer of Elliott Management, according to people familiar with the situation. Asness recently gave to the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) and a political action committee supporting Pennsylvania Senator Patrick Toomey, according to public filings. Singer has also given to the NRSC, in addition to Together Holding Our Majority PAC, which recently sent money to two Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and Richard Burr of North Carolina. Asness and Singer declined to comment. Spokespersons for Trump, Clinton and Johnson did not respond to a request for comment. To be sure, Trump retains a band of loyal hedge fund industry boosters. They include Robert Mercer of Renaissance Technologies and economic advisers Anthony Scaramucci of SkyBridge Capital, John Paulson of Paulson & Co, Stephen Feinberg of Cerberus Capital Management and Steven Mnuchin of Dune Capital Management. Mercer and Scaramucci have re-affirmed their support of Trump in public statements over the last week. Other investors have moved firmly into the Democratic camp: Billionaire Seth Klarman of Baupost Group and Boaz Weinstein of Saba Capital Management are among investors who recently gave Clinton money after years of donations to candidates from both parties. Weinstein declined to comment and Klarman told Reuters in August that Trump is completely unqualified for the highest office in the land.  Attitudes against Trump have hardened since multiple women have accused him of groping them and the release of a 2005 video in which he boasts about such behavior. Trump has denied the accusations and has said his comments were just locker room talk. One Republican hedge fund industry veteran said that his peers revulsion with Trump has become so strong that they feel they have to vote for Clinton - if only to prevent the Republican nominee from winning.  She at least represents predictability and seasoning, the person said. The difference between her and Trump is no contest. ",politicsNews,"October 17, 2016 ",1
"How Trump, Clinton would fix the 'crazy' U.S. health system","(Reuters) - When former President Bill Clinton called parts of Obamacare crazy, he put his wife Hillary Clinton on the defensive and gave much-needed ammunition to her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, who wants to scrap it. Bill Clinton said this month that while millions more Americans now have insurance coverage under President Barack Obamas signature 2010 healthcare law, small businesses and some families are still getting killed by surging healthcare costs. He later clarified that he was not criticizing the entire  initiative, he was just making an argument for fixing it.  Still,Clintons comments may not have been so crazy. He put aspotlighton an uncomfortable truth: after six years, billions of dollars and a sweeping reform that stands as Obamas single biggest domestic policy achievement, health care is still unaffordable for many Americans. Americans are growing increasingly anxious about rising healthcare costs, and critics of the law have said it is not living up to its promises. Two of the nations largest health insurers, Aetna and United Healthcare, are also pulling out of the state-based health insurance exchanges that are the best-known creations of Obamacare. Clinton says she wants to save the best of Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act, while reducing costs. Trump says it is an expensive disaster that is on track to implode in 2017. He wants to replace it with something cheaper. Whoever wins the presidency on Nov. 8 will likely face pressure to move quickly to reshape a healthcare initiative that affects millions of Americans. Republicans opposed Obamacare from the start, labeling it a government intrusion into the healthcare market. Some of them say the individual exchanges where Americans shop online for coverage are already in a death spiral. They warn that with fewer consumers using the exchanges, more health insurers will exit them, sending premiums even higher, and further deterring people from signing up. As the U.S. population ages, U.S. spending on healthcare - $2.9 trillion in 2014 - is projected to rise to more than one-fifth of the nations gross domestic product. Spending rates under Obamacare did slow for a time, but they are on the rise again. Trump has proposed getting rid of the exchanges and setting up tax-free health savings accounts for people with high-deductible insurance plans. He has also said he would set up state-based high-risk pools for people with medical conditions that make it hard to get coverage on their own. He also wants to allow companies to sell insurance across state lines to boost competition and drive down prices. His advisers say he would draw on a plan proposed by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives, which includes a refundable tax credit to help Americans buy individual plans. Republicans, like Trump, also want to change how they fund Medicaid, which serves poor families. Obamacare increased federal funding to states that expanded the program to more people with low incomes. Now Trump wants to limit funding by switching to pre-set, block grants. Health policy experts are skeptical selling insurance across state lines would do much to rein in health insurance costs. And health wonks on both sides of the aisle said Republicans would likely balk at any proposals that threatened to yank health insurance away from 20 million people. Even Republican members of the House and the Senate are going to end up resisting rolling back the Medicaid expansion if that means that lots of people in their states would go uninsured, said Jim Capretta, a health policy expert at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute.  Liberals like former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders havent called Obamacare crazy, but Sanders does believe it doesnt go nearly far enough. During his campaign, he proposed replacing it with a single-payer insurance system he called Medicare for all, based on the government plan for elderly and disabled Americans. Hillary Clintons plan doesnt go that far, but she would build on Obamacare by expanding tax credits for people shopping on the individual marketplaces, letting Americans buy into Medicare at a younger age, and adding a public option, or a government-run insurance plan to compete with private insurers on the exchanges.  She has also proposed reducing Americans out-of-pocket expenses outside their private insurance by offering a new refundable tax credit, and she would give states more federal funding to expand Medicaid for low-income people. Two-thirds of states expanded Medicaid under the 2010 law, and thats where most of the newly insured people got coverage. Policy experts said that after Obama leaves office, more Republican-led states that objected to a plan so closely identified with Obama might be willing to expand Medicaid too.  Clintons ability to expand tax incentives likely depends on which party controls the U.S. Congress. And while some states could act independently to launch public plans on their exchanges, many Republicans view the idea as wildly expensive and would strongly resist any effort by Clinton to require them nationwide. Obamacare did little to deal with soaring drug prices for lifesaving treatments like Mylan NVs EpiPen. Democrats and Republicans say thats a problem for the next president, even though its getting little attention on the campaign trail. Trump and Clinton both want Americans to be allowed to buy cheaper drugs from overseas (Americans pay the highest prices in the world for drugs). Former Democratic U.S. Representative Henry Waxman made a similar proposal in 2009, but he was defeated by pressure from drug companies, which would likely oppose it again.  Clinton says Medicare should negotiate drug prices with companies, using its 55 million users to get a better deal. Trump made a similar call during the Republican primaries but it does not appear on his campaign website now. Some health policy experts believe drug companies would respond to lower prices for Medicare patients by raising prices for everyone else. And to negotiate better prices, Medicare would have to be willing to stop covering certain drugs, which would be unpopular, they say. Clinton has also suggested creating a commission that would watch for sudden spikes in prices of older life-saving drugs, a proposal that health policy experts said is achievable through rule making rather than legislation. She has also proposed a cap on drug co-payments. Clinton has already put Wall Street on watch. Her tweets have brought down shares of Mylan and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, which helped push many institutional investors out of healthcare stocks. Drug companies are already responding to political pressure. Botox maker Allergan Inc, for example, recently committed to keeping price increases below 10 percent.

Vietnam gives thumbs-up to U.S. regional role as pivot stumbles,"HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam supports U.S. intervention in the Asia-Pacific if it helps keep peace and stability, the defense ministry said, in a timely endorsement of a continued U.S. presence amid uncertainty over Washingtons faltering pivot. Vice defense minister, Senior Lieutenant-General Nguyen Chi Vinh, met on Monday with Cara Abercrombie, the U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for South and Southeast Asia, and told her Vietnam backed a positive U.S. role. The generals words of support, conveyed by a normally reclusive defense ministry, come when the United States most needs them, with its rebalance - aimed at boosting its Asian foothold and tempering Chinas rise - now under strain in the run-up to a U.S. presidential election. Vinh affirmed that Vietnam will support the U.S and other partners to intervene in the region as long as it brings peace, stability and prosperity, it said in a statement. At the dialogue, Abercrombie said the United States would not change its rebalance strategy, the statement added. Uncertainty lingers in Asia over changes ahead at the White House and whether a new leadership would give less priority to keeping China in check as it grows increasingly assertive in the South China Sea, a waterway vital to global trade. Washingtons traditional defense alliances in Southeast Asia are currently being tested, with ties with Thailand frosty since a 2014 coup and questions about the future of a tight military relationship with the Philippines under volatile new President Rodrigo Duterte, a staunch U.S. critic. Relations between the United States and Vietnam, in contrast, have warmed substantially in the past two years, much to do with jitters over the South China Sea to which Hanoi has disputes with Beijing. The latest affirmation of those ties came after the full lifting of a U.S. lethal arms embargo on Vietnam in May, allowing closer defense links and some joint military exercises between the former enemies. Two U.S. warships earlier this month made a call at a new international port built at Vietnams strategic Cam Ranh Bay in a brief but symbolic return for U.S. combat vessels. The U.S. ambassador to Vietnam last week admitted the U.S. dynamism once seen in the region had a little bit diminished, but said there was still appetite for U.S. involvement. Ted Osius also said a dramatic change in U.S.-Vietnam ties was not about to happen because of Philippine leader Dutertes outreach toward China. ",politicsNews,"October 18, 2016 ",1
Voting for Trump? Pennsylvania Republican senator will not say,"(Reuters) - Republican candidates in tight races across the country have tied themselves in knots trying to decide whether to disavow or support their partys presidential nominee, Donald Trump, especially since multiple sexual assault allegations against him have surfaced. But U.S. Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, who is in a virtual tie with his Democratic challenger in a race that could tip control of the Senate, has chosen a third option: say nothing. Toomey appears to be the only vulnerable Republican senator to have avoided answering the question of whether he will vote for Trump, even as he has denounced the billionaire real estate developers lewd comments about women and allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior. His Democratic challenger, Katie McGinty, has spent days hammering Toomey for his reticence, coining the term Fraidy-Pat and tying his candidacy to that of Trumps at every turn. But Pennsylvania political analysts say Toomey may have taken the safest path given his need to stitch together a coalition of working-class, white voters who support Trump and moderate, college-educated suburbanites who find his rhetoric distasteful. Polling averages show Trump losing the state to Hillary Clinton by a margin of 6 to 7 percentage points, while McGinty held a lead of less than 1 point in the Senate race, in polls before the Senate candidates debated on Monday. Pennsylvania has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since George H.W. Bush in 1988. Toomey won his seat in 2010 by just 2 percentage points. I think for him hes making the right choice, because I think he has to have it both ways, said G. Terry Madonna, the director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Hes between a rock and a hard place, and hes chosen to stay in the middle. The question of whether to back their partys presidential nominee - a non-issue in virtually any other election year - has bedeviled Republicans facing competitive races across the country, with control of the Senate hanging in the balance. Some, like Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, have rescinded their support, angering Trumps core supporters. Others, like Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, have stuck with Trump and risked losing moderate voters. A handful of Republicans, including Ayotte before she recently changed her mind, have tried to straddle the issue by withholding a formal endorsement while saying they still planned to vote for Trump. The Pennsylvania campaign, one of half a dozen close contests with the Senate up for grabs, has been the most expensive Senate race in the country, with more than $100 million from the parties and outside groups pouring into the state as of August. McGinty, who served as an environmental adviser in former President Bill Clintons administration, has spent months trying to link Toomey to Trump. She has redoubled her efforts over the last 10 days, as multiple women have come forward to accuse Trump of sexually assaulting them following the release of a video recording from 2005 in which he bragged in lewd terms about such behavior.  On Thursday, for the second time since the tape became public, McGinty held a conference call for reporters to assail Toomey for what she described as his tacit support for Trump. Senator Pat Toomey now has the distinction of being the only Senate candidate in the entire United States of America to refuse to come clean about whether or not he supports Donald Trump, she said. So, theres only one way to interpret that: Pat Toomey is still standing by Donald Trump. Toomey has criticized Trumps outrageous comments but has declined to say whether he will vote for him, a position he reiterated on Monday at the first of two debates with McGinty. He did, however, say he probably will announce a decision before the Nov. 8 elections, after previously suggesting he might not. In a statement, a Toomey spokesman turned the criticism around, calling McGinty a rubber stamp for the Democratic establishment in Washington. Pat Toomey has proven he will stand up to his own party for Pennsylvania families, like on gun safety, fighting corporate welfare, or ending the Wall Street bailouts once and for all, the spokesman, Ted Kwong, said in an email. Katie McGinty cant name a single disagreement with her party, whether its the reckless Iran deal or thousands in new middle-class tax hikes. Charlie Gerow, a veteran Republican political consultant in Pennsylvania who is not involved in the race, said Toomeys middle-of-the-road strategy was necessary given the deficit Trump is facing in the state. Toomey, Gerow said, cannot afford to alienate Trump backers in places like southwestern Pennsylvania, even as he tries to appeal to voters in the Philadelphia and Lehigh Valley suburbs. I think it is the best strategy among several unpalatable options, Gerow said. I dont think there was any better way to approach that dilemma. ",politicsNews,"October 18, 2016 ",1
State Department official 'pressured' FBI to declassify Clinton email: FBI documents,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A senior State Department official sought to shield Hillary Clinton last year by pressuring the FBI to drop its insistence that an email on the private server she used while secretary of state contained classified information, according to records of interviews with FBI officials released on Monday. The accusation against Patrick Kennedy, the State Departments most senior manager, appears in the latest release of interview summaries from the Federal Bureau of Investigations year-long investigation into Clintons sending and receiving classified government secrets via her unauthorized server.  Although the FBI decided against declassifying the emails contents, the claim of interference added fuel to Republicans belief that officials in President Barack Obamas administration have sought to protect Clinton, a Democrat, from criminal liability as she seeks to succeed Obama in the Nov. 8 election. The FBI recommended against bringing any charges in July and has defended the integrity of its investigation. Clinton has said her decision to use a private server in her home for her work as the U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 was a mistake and has apologized. One FBI official, whose name is redacted, told investigators that Kennedy repeatedly pressured the various officials at the FBI to declassify information in one of Clintons emails. The email was about the deadly 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, and included information that originated from the FBI, which meant that the FBI had final say on whether it would remain classified. A State Department spokesman, Mark Toner, said Kennedy was not pressuring the FBI but was just trying to understand better how the FBIs classification process worked. The dispute began in the summer of 2015 as officials were busy reviewing the roughly 30,000 emails Clinton returned to the State Department ahead of their court-ordered public release in batches in 2015 and 2016. The official said the State Departments office of legal counsel called him to question the FBIs ruling that the information was classified, but the FBI stood by its decision. Soon after that call, one of the officials FBI colleagues received a call from Kennedy in which Kennedy asked his assistance in altering the emails classification in exchange for a quid pro quo.  The FBI official said he also joined at least two discussions in which Kennedy continued to pressure the FBI about the email. The official said Kennedy appeared to be trying to protect Clinton by minimizing the appearance of classified information in emails from the server that Clinton used while she was the countrys most senior diplomat. In a separate interview summary among the 100 pages released on Monday, another unnamed FBI official confirmed a discussion of a quid pro quo. He said Kennedy told him in a phone call that the FBIs classification of the email caused problems for Kennedy. The official said he told Kennedy he would look into the email, which he had not yet seen, if the State Department would consider allowing more FBI agents to be posted in Iraq in exchange.  The State Department and the FBI both confirmed that a conversation about the emails classification and an increase in FBI slots in Iraq took place, but both agencies said there was no quid pro quo. After a year-long FBI investigation into the server, FBI Director James Comey said in July he found that while laws governing classified information may have been broken no reasonable prosecutor would bring charges. He said, however, that Clinton and her staff had been extremely careless in handling information that had been classified to protect national security. Toner, the State Department spokesman, said there was no quid pro quo, and told reporters that it was the FBI official who raised the possibility with Kennedy of allowing more agents in Iraq during the conversation about the email. After the conversation took place about the upgrading classification, at the end of that, there was a kind of, Oh, by the way, hey, were looking at how we want more slots in Iraq, Toner said, calling it a clear pivot in the topic of conversation. No increase in FBI Iraq slots resulted from this conversation, he said. The FBI also confirmed both topics were raised in the same conversation, and that the FBI official who discussed the email and Iraq with Kennedy had since retired. Although there was never a quid pro quo, these allegations were nonetheless referred to the appropriate officials for review, the FBI said in its statement, which did not say what the outcome of the review was. Other officials have made similar complaints to investigators of unusual pressure not to mark information as classified in Clintons emails last year. According to earlier documents the FBI released last month, at least one official at the State Department told investigators that there was pressure by senior department officials to mislead the public about the presence of classified information in Clintons emails ahead of their public release. A summary released on Monday showed at least two other State Department officials making similar allegations.  One official who worked in the State Departments office that deals with Freedom of Information Act requests told investigators they felt intimidated by senior department officials if they suggested that any of Clintons emails on Benghazi contained classified information, and named Kennedy as one of the officials who pressured employees to not label anything as classified. The State Department has said these allegations are also false. Ultimately, the FBI told Kennedy that declassification was not possible, according to the interview summaries, and the State Department posted it online last year marked as classified, with heavy redactions. Clintons Republican rival for the White House, Donald Trump, posted a video online on Monday in which he said the FBI documents showed corruption at the highest levels. This is collusion between the FBI, Department of Justice and the State Department to try and make Hillary Clinton look like an innocent person when shes guilty of very high crimes, Trump said.  Later on Monday, Trump proposed a series of ethics rules he said would crack down on government corruption, including a five-year ban on former administration officials lobbying after leaving government and a lifetime ban on senior officials lobbying for foreign governments.  He said former President Bill Clinton had a five-year lobbying ban but lifted it at the end of his administration.  Obama put his own revolving door rules in place at the beginning of his time in office. Several Republican lawmakers called on Obama to investigate Kennedy and remove him from the department. Toner of the State Department said Kennedy has the full confidence of John Kerry, Clintons successor as secretary of state. Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committees chairman, said in a statement that Obama, who is campaigning for Clinton to become his successor as president, was trying to shield Clinton and that she cannot be trusted with classified information. Paul Ryan, the top elected Republican in the U.S. Congress, referred to the FBI summaries on Twitter. This bears all the signs of a cover-up, he wrote. In 2015, Clinton repeatedly said she never sent or received classified information via her server, but since the release of the FBI report in July she has said she relied on the judgment of her subordinates at the department. Robby Mook, her campaign manager, downplayed the account from the FBI interview summary, telling reporters it was not uncommon for officials within a department to fight over classification.

"North Carolina police probe arson, graffiti threat at Republican office","WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - Police in North Carolina sought leads on Monday about a fire they believe was deliberately set at a local Republican headquarters over the weekend and a graffiti message warning the political party to leave town or else. Investigators are treating the incident as arson. The fire caused heavy damage to the Orange County Republican Partys office in Hillsborough, North Carolina, about 40 miles (65 km) from the state capital of Raleigh.  This is political terrorism, said Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party.  Both Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton condemned the attack. North Carolina is considered a battleground state that could play a pivotal role in the Nov. 8 presidential contest. We are taking this incident very seriously and have significant resources at the local, state and federal level committed to this investigation, Hillsborough Police Chief Duane Hampton said in a statement on Monday, asking anyone with information to come forward. Hillsborough police said a bottle containing flammable material ignited after being thrown through a front window of the headquarters between midnight and about 9 a.m. on Sunday, when a nearby business owner reported the crime. Someone has firebombed through the window (of) the Republican party up here beside me and sprayed all over the side of my building, Nazi Republicans leave town or else, the caller told a 911 operator in a call released on Monday. A swastika also was spray-painted on the neighboring building, police said. They said no one was in the party office at the time, but the substance burned furniture and charred campaign signs. White House spokesman Josh Earnest praised the efforts of self-described Democrats who raised about $13,000 in an online GoFundMe campaign to help Republicans reopen the office. Thats consistent with the values that we lift up in this country, he said at a news briefing. There is no justification for the use of violence to advance a political agenda. In a tweet on Sunday, Clinton said she was grateful no one was hurt in the attack, which she called horrific and unacceptable. Trump blamed his Democratic opponents supporters for the crime. Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning, he said on Twitter. Registered Democrats far outnumber Republicans in Orange County, according to elections board data.  Republicans said the incident took them by surprise but left them undeterred as they started clean-up efforts at their strip-mall headquarters and worked in a bus being used as a temporary mobile office.  Were not going to be intimated; were not going to be cowed, Woodhouse said.  On Monday, the Arizona Republican Party headquarters in Phoenix was evacuated for about two hours after a bomb threat was left by phone. Police said nothing was found during a search of the premises.  Party officials said the call was received from an adult male at about 3:15 p.m. local time saying there was a bomb in the building and for occupants to get out.  ",politicsNews,"October 17, 2016 ",1
New Jersey 'Bridgegate' defendant says he was duped,"NEWARK, N.J. (Reuters) - After days of complaints about traffic jams at a major New York bridge in 2013, New Jersey Governor Chris Christies associate demanded to know if lane closures were political retribution, he testified on Monday. On trial over his alleged role in the Bridgegate scandal, Bill Baroni, Christies top political appointee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said he confronted fellow authority executive David Wildstein to ask whether the lane closures in September 2013 were an act of retribution against the Democratic mayor of a commuter town. I said, David, tell me right now, is this true? Baroni testified in federal court in Newark, where he is on trial on fraud charges. He looked me in the eye and said, Absolutely not. In his first day of testimony, Baroni asserted that Wildstein orchestrated the lane closures without his knowledge to punish Mark Sokolich, the mayor of Fort Lee, for his refusal to endorse Christies re-election bid. Baroni also rejected Wildsteins contention that they discussed the scheme with Christie as it was unfolding. Christie had soared to national prominence in late 2012 for his response to Superstorm Sandy and wanted to use that spotlight, and an aura of bipartisan spirit, to catapult himself towards the White House. But the scandal hurt his image and his campaign ultimately collapsed early this year, though he has always denied involvement. Baronis story was entirely at odds with the narrative U.S. prosecutors have presented at trial. They have accused Baroni, Wildstein and former Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly of conspiring to create the traffic jam to punish Sokolich. Kelly, on trial alongside Baroni, is also expected to testify. Wildstein has pleaded guilty and appeared as the governments star witness earlier in the case. Baroni said he confronted Wildstein after receiving a letter from Sokolich suggesting the closures had punitive overtones. But during cross-examination, Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee Cortes pointed out that days before, Sokolich left him a voicemail asking whos mad at me? So the first time you heard from him, he was asking if someone was mad at him? It wasnt Thursday? Cortes asked. Baroni said he believed Wildsteins representation that the George Washington Bridge lane closure was part of a traffic study and that he should not respond to Sokolich.  Ive regretted it ever since, Baroni said. Wildstein said he and Baroni invented the traffic study as a cover story. ",politicsNews,"October 17, 2016 ",1

Trump's son-in-law held talks to set up Trump TV network: source,"(Reuters) - Donald Trumps son-in-law, Jared Kushner, informally approached LionTree Advisors Chief Executive Aryeh Bourkoff about setting up a Trump TV network after the U.S. presidential election, but the investment bank does not want to be involved, according to a person familiar with the matter. Kushner contacted Bourkoff, one of the media industrys top dealmakers, in the past few months, but there have been no further conversations, the source said on Monday. The source asked not to be identified because the discussions were private. There was no reason given for LionTrees reluctance to participate in the process.  The Financial Times first reported the LionTree talks earlier on Monday, citing sources.(on.ft.com/2dIbnrX) Trump, the Republican U.S. presidential nominee, told the Washington Post last month he had no interest in a media company and that reports he was considering setting up one were a false rumor. He trails Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Kushner, the owner of the weekly New York Observer newspaper, is married to Trumps daughter Ivanka. Kushner did not respond to requests for comment. LionTree declined comment. To set up a television network, Trump would have to negotiate with cable and satellite carriers, which can be an arduous task. It can then take years to turn a profit. Fox News Channel, the most-watched U.S. cable network, took five years to be profitable.  It might be easier and less expensive for Trump to launch an online streaming service.

Trump foundation stops fundraising in New York state,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps charitable foundation has stopped fundraising in New York state, the state attorney generals office said on Monday, weeks after the office warned that a failure to do so would constitute a continuing fraud.     The Donald J. Trump Foundation also received an extension to file financial paperwork with the state, a spokesman for the attorney generals office said in a phone interview. The Trump campaign said in a statement: The Trump Foundation is cooperating with the Office of the NY AG in its investigation of the Foundation and, given the scope of the NY AGs requests, is working with the NY AG to respond in a reasonable and timely manner.  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman warned the group last month that it was in violation of a state law requiring charitable organizations that solicit outside donations to register with the offices Charities Bureau. The organization has been under increased scrutiny following reports in the Washington Post suggesting possible improprieties within the small-scale nonprofit organization. Trumps campaign has suggested that the probe launched by Schneiderman, a Democrat, was politically motivated. Trumps Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in the Nov. 8 election, also has ties to a charitable organization, the Clinton Foundation. Trump has called it a pay-to-play operation in which the former secretary of state and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, rewarded big donors to the foundation with political access. There has been no evidence that foreign donors to the foundation obtained favors from the State Department while Clinton headed the agency. While some donors were able to obtain meetings with her or senior State Department officials, Clinton has said the fact that they had donated to the foundation did not play a role in her decision to meet with them.

Trump hovers over tight U.S. House race in Florida,"ORLANDO (Reuters) - Ask John Mica why he sticks by Donald Trump, amid the defections of many fellow Republicans, and the U.S. congressman from central Florida instead touts his own work on easing traffic congestion in this tourism Mecca. Ask again about his support for Trump and the mild-mannered Mica shows subtle signs of becoming annoyed. Mica has become adept at tiptoeing around Trump questions as his support for the controversial presidential candidate complicates his effort to extend a 24-year reign in Congress. The race between Mica and his Democratic challenger, newcomer Stephanie Murphy, 38, could be a bellwether for Republicans who seek to support the partys presidential nominee while maintaining a safe distance from some of Trumps more controversial positions and alleged bad behavior.  The course of the campaign could provide clues on whether Republicans maintain control of the House of Representatives in a year in which Trump has shaken his party and the political world with his bombast.  Voters in his Orlando district dont care about all this garbage thats going on in the presidential race, says Mica, as he steers the conversation to improving healthcare for military veterans, creating jobs and expanding local airports. Micas re-election bid is also made unusually tough because of a newly-drawn congressional district that gives Democrats hope of a win.  Murphy has sought to use Micas support for Trump against him by saying that just as Mica has stuck with Trump too long, he follows Republican leaders in Congress all too often. She ticks off Micas support for gun positions pushed by the powerful National Rifle Association, especially after Junes massacre in Orlando of 49 people at a gay nightclub. Murphy has said Mica is out of step with the reconfigured district, which she said is evenly split and not especially partisan.  As Mica campaigns on his ability to deliver goods to his district in the form of job creation and infrastructure investment, Democrats are making sure to remind voters that he is aligned with the man who arguably is one of the most controversial major party presidential candidates in history. Democrats punctuate that with a photo of Trump and Mica side-by-side at a 2014 ceremony celebrating the start of construction of a Trump hotel in Washington. Early trends of mail-in ballots in the 7th congressional district point to a competitive race. In Orange County, 10,975 Democrats have cast early votes compared to only 6,732 Republicans and 3,525 independents. Orlando may be famous as the home of the fantasy land that is Disney World. But Micas district is a real-life mirror of America. Its residents are politically divided, in this case about evenly split between Republicans and Democrats and with a strong dose of independent voters. Furthermore, as in other parts of the country, Latino voters in central Florida are building political muscle. As Mica, 73, wages a ground-war that has him knocking on constituents doors in Orlandos heat and humidity, he walks a fine line. He is a grandson of immigrants who boasts of being hard nosed against amnesty for the 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally. But he suggests there could be exceptions to Trumps promise to deport them all. Building a wall on the southern border with Mexico, a linchpin of Trumps campaign, should be done where it makes sense, Mica said during an interview with Reuters amid a lunchtime crowd of mainly Hispanic customers at the Lechonera El Barrio restaurant. Still, as prominent Republicans offended by the tenor of Trumps campaign, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, distance themselves from Trump, Mica stands firm, saying, Im pretty much a party loyalist. Such loyalty can come with a price, though, and Mica acknowledges, Im stuck with the Republican (presidential) nominee whom he said made vulgar, reprehensible remarks about sexual advances on women captured in a 2005 videotape that recently became public. But there is an upside to supporting Trump as well. Mica said some supporters want to know that he is sticking with the nominee. These people are very passionate. Theyre going to be voting, he said. Miriam Ramirez, a former Republican legislator in Puerto Rico who lives part-time in Florida and has been stumping for Mica, worries Trump could complicate Micas re-election.  Asked whether Micas appeal to the districts booming Puerto Rican population could suffer because of his association with Trump,  Ramirez said, Yes, especially in lower-income families. Murphy, who came to the United States as a child after she and her family escaped Vietnam and were adrift in the South China Sea before being rescued by the U.S. Navy, said Trumps hateful and divisive rhetoric has voters worried that he will act on the prejudices he has laid out if elected. Voters choose political leaders they believe will do the best for them but also represent the best in them, Murphy said, challenging Micas support of Trump. One thing seems certain in the closing weeks of the campaign: Mica is staying on message as he tiptoes around Trump, instead talking about the interstate (highway) massive rebuild and the airport in Seminole County that had weeds growing up...out of the runway and now supports thousands of jobs.

Factbox: Wall Street's take on possible impact of U.S. elections,"(Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump are in a tight race ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.  Following is a weekly roundup of financial market analysts views on the U.S. elections and the likely implications of a Trump or Clinton win on financial markets.   MORE COVERAGE: bit.ly/2dOgcoE SEE RELATED FACTBOX: reut.rs/2d9cl4q DAVID KOSTIN, U.S. PORTFOLIO STRATEGY RESEARCH, GOLDMAN SACHS A so-called wave election would occur if one party registers large congressional seat gains and has the potential to implement policy changes... Following six prior wave elections, S&P 500 typically fell during the subsequent 1 and 3 months. Our strategies: buy health care equipment and services/sell pharma and biotech; own firms with high government sales; (and) own high overseas cash. Whether its Hillary or Trump, the U.S. is unlikely to break out of secular stagnation.With respect to the election, our focus will remain on the impact that the next U.S. president will likely have on fiscal and monetary policies, as well as the global growth outlook. Unfortunately, we dont see either candidate as likely to purse a true pro-growth agenda that will break the U.S. economy out of its current malaise.  Interest rates: We see rising upside risk for longer-term U.S. rates, regardless of the outcome in November.The biggest upside risk for a sustained increase in longer-term rates is rising risk premiums. Credit growth: With Trumps negative comments regarding Dodd-Frank, our sense is a Trump victory could jumpstart lending. We believe a Hillary win would create even stiffer headwinds and more regulation for the financial services industry. Sector recommendations: - Buy on Clinton win, sell on Trump win: alternative energy, housing and REITs, hospitals and managed care, exporters and companies with international exposure  - Buy on Trump win, sell on Clinton win: exploration and production, banks, big pharma and biotechnology, high tax rate companies - Potential upside in either scenario: infrastructure companies, cash repatriation companies, defense, gun manufacturers  Infrastructure spending: In a rare example of bipartisan support, both candidates have discussed the need to repair crumbling infrastructure... The correlation between infrastructure spending and equity returns has deteriorated in recent years, but candidates outsized plans could still be a tailwind for infrastructure-levered stocks.  Names overweight-rated Eaton Corp and equal-weight-rated Pentair preferred plays, given both companies leverage to infrastructure investments and attractive relative valuation.  Utilities and clean energy sector: Hillary Clinton has been an outspoken advocate of renewable energy and improving resiliency of the electric grid, while Donald Trump has made numerous statements in support of fossil fuels. We see a Trump presidency as largely maintaining the current level of utility infrastructure spend, while a Clinton presidency could result in meaningful upside, particularly in clean energy. Thus, from the standpoint of long-term growth, we see a positive risk/reward for utilities going into the election.        Market moves: In this presidential election, there is no social mandate coming from economic dislocation, nor a likelihood of any party receiving a super majority that would cause major legislative change. As a result, any election-based (market) movement  before and after  should prove temporary. Clearly, there is a lot of rhetoric, but that does not equal legislative success. Global markets: We analyzed equity returns before and after the U.S. election. The Hang Seng tends to do well one month before the election and then performs till the end of the year. The Nikkei 225 tends to do well one month afterwards. Interestingly, the VIX consistently rises one and three months before the election while the dollar tends to strengthen. Bonds tend to do better after the election result going into the year-end. Clinton win: If elected, we believe that Hillary Clinton would push for expanded trade deals, including a revised or modified TPP-like agreement, albeit these deals would likely include increased protections for US workers, as well as expanded provisions for trade adjustment assistance.    Trump win: Donald Trump, if elected, is likely to actively oppose any expansion of trade, and he plans to withdraw from TPP, direct the Secretary of Commerce and Treasury to identify violations of trade agreements and unfair trade practices, renegotiate NAFTA, and use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes.   CHRIS KRUEGER, COWEN WASHINGTON RESEARCH GROUP, COWEN AND COMPANY Trump win (GOP Sweep): Positive for consumer discretionary, energy, industrials, IT, telecom and materials sectors; negative for healthcare; neutral for consumer staples, financials and utilities Clinton win with GOP House: Positive for industrials, IT, materials and utilities sectors; negative for energy and telecom sectors; neutral for consumer discretionary and staples, financials and healthcare Clinton win with a Democratic House: Positive for industrials, IT and materials sectors; negative for energy, financials, health care and telecom sectors; neutral for consumer discretionary and staples, and utilities ",politicsNews,"October 17, 2016 ",1

Trump charges U.S. election results being rigged 'at many polling places',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump dug deeper in his efforts to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the U.S. election, saying on Twitter on Sunday that he believed the results were being rigged at many polling places.  His tweet came hours after his vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, said Republicans would accept the outcome of the Nov. 8 contest between Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD, Trump wrote on Twitter, in the latest of a series of comments he has made over the past several days calling into question the fairness of the election. Trump, who is trailing Clinton in opinion polls, did not provide any evidence to back his allegations of impropriety at the voting booth. Early voting and voting by mail have begun in many states. In another tweet later on Sunday, Trump blamed animals representing Hillary Clinton and Democrats in North Carolina for an overnight attack on a local Republican Party headquarters in that state. Local authorities said the building in Hillsborough, North Carolina, had been struck through a front window with flammable material and an adjacent building wall was spray-painted with a swastika and the words Nazi Republicans leave town or else. Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning, Trump tweeted. Clinton denounced the attack as horrific and unacceptable in her own tweet, adding: Very grateful that everyone is safe. Trump, a New York businessman, who has never held elective office, has often said the electoral process is skewed against him, including during the Republican nominating contests, when he disputed the method for winning delegates to the Republican National Convention. His latest complaint of media bias stems from allegations by women that he groped them or made other unwanted sexual advances, after a 2005 video became public in which Trump was recorded bragging about such behavior. He apologized for the video but has denied each of the accusations. Election is being rigged by the media, in a coordinated effort with the Clinton campaign, by putting stories that never happened into news! Trump tweeted on Sunday, a sentiment he also expressed in posts and during rallies in Maine and New Hampshire on Saturday. The comments raised questions both from  Republicans and Democrats about whether he would accept the outcome should he lose to Clinton. Trump said after the first presidential debate in September that he would absolutely accept the election outcome. But a few days afterward, he told the New York Times: Were going to see what happens.  He has also urged his supporters to keep an eye on voting locations to prevent a stolen election, which some critics interpreted as encouraging them to intimidate voters. Pence said on Sunday he and Trump would respect the will of the voters. Well respect the outcome of this election, said Pence, the Indiana governor. Donald Trump said in the first debate that well respect the will of the American people in this election. The peaceful transfer of power is a hallmark of American history. In a weekend statement quoted by media, a spokeswoman for U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top U.S. elected Republican, said: Our democracy relies on confidence in election results, and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity.  On Sunday, Pence for the second time in recent weeks broke from Trump on Russia, this time on that countrys possible involvement in email hacks tied to the U.S. election, saying Moscow should face severe consequences if it has compromised U.S. email security.  I think theres no question that the evidence continues to point in that direction, Pence said. There should be severe consequences to Russia or any sovereign nation that is compromising the privacy or the security of the United States of America, Pence said on Fox News Sunday. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week his country was not involved in trying to influence the U.S. election. Trump, who has been criticized for appearing too close to Russia after he publicly praised Putins governing style, has questioned the reports of Moscows involvement. Maybe there is no hacking, he said during last weeks second debate with Clinton. Trump also contradicted Pence on Russia during that debate. Pence had said the United States should use military force in Syria if Russia continued air strikes to prop up President Bashar al-Assad, but Trump said he disagreed. The third and final debate between Trump and Clinton will be on Wednesday in Las Vegas. ",politicsNews,"October 16, 2016 ",1
Trump: Sexual-assault accusers 'want to stop our movement',"CHARLOTTE, N.C./LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump on Friday charged that the women accusing him of sexual misconduct fabricated their stories to damage his campaign after two more women came forward with allegations that he had groped them. The new accusations were made by a contestant on his reality TV show The Apprentice, who cited a 2007 incident, and by a woman who described an incident from the early 1990s. With the allegations against Trump dominating the campaign, opinion polls show Trump trailing Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll taken Oct. 7-13 and released on Friday showed Trump behind Clinton by 7 percentage points among likely voters in the Nov. 8 election. Trump has spent more and more time at his rallies denying allegations of groping since a video from 2005 became public a week ago showing him bragging about groping and making unwanted sexual advances. On Friday, in addition to his denials, he suggested that he never would have found two of the women who have made allegations attractive. Summer Zervos, who competed on the fifth season of The Apprentice in 2006, appeared at a news conference with celebrity attorney Gloria Allred in Los Angeles, saying Trump kissed her, touched her breast and tried to get her to lie down on a bed with him during a meeting about a possible job. He put me in an embrace and I tried to push him away. I pushed his chest to put space between us and I said, Come on man, get real. He repeated my words back to me, Get real, as he began thrusting his genitals, Zervos said. Zervos said she thought Trump was going to take her to dinner to discuss a job, but the meeting took place in his bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. I wondered if the sexual behavior was some kind of test and whether or not I had passed by rejecting it, she said, but Trump later offered her a job at a golf course for half the salary she had requested. Trump released a statement denying her allegations. I vaguely remember Ms. Zervos as one of the many contestants on The Apprentice over the years. To be clear, I never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago, Trump said. That is not who I am as a person, and it is not how Ive conducted my life. At his last event of the day on Friday, in Charlotte, Trump suggested that his accusers were fabricating their stories for publicity or to damage his campaign. Its not hard to find a small handful of people willing to make false smears, he said.  Trump said the women may be motivated for financial reasons or political reasons or the simple reason they want to stop our movement. Earlier Friday, the Washington Post published an interview with a woman who said Trump put his hand up her skirt in a crowded New York nightclub in the early 1990s in an unwanted advance. He did touch my vagina through my underwear, absolutely, Kristin Anderson said in a video interview on the newspapers website. It wasnt a sexual come-on. I dont know why he did it. It was like just to prove that he could do it, she told the newspaper. Anderson could not be reached for comment. Trumps White House campaign has been scrambling to recover from the release a week ago of the 2005 video. While Trump said the video was just talk and he had never behaved in that way, several women subsequently went public with allegations of sexual misconduct against the New York real estate magnate going back three decades. National opinion polls have shown that women voters have been fleeing Trump in large numbers, putting his campaign in free-fall. Late on Friday, the Trump campaign put forward a British man who disputed the account of one of the accusers, Jessica Leeds.  Leeds, who is now 74, said Trump groped her on a flight to New York, in or around 1980. Her account was published in The New York Times earlier this week and she has since been interviewed on CNN. The New York Post reported that the man, Anthony Gilberthorpe, contacted the Trump campaign after Leeds went public with her story, and said he was sitting near Leeds and Trump in first class on the same flight.  I was there, I was in a position to know that what she said was wrong, wrong, wrong, said Gilberthorpe, who is now 54 and would have been a teenager at the time. Trump had been promising that he would soon provide information showing the allegations against him were false. Gilberthorpe is known in Britain for his claims that he provided underage boys to British politicians for sex parties in the 1980s. Trump, 70, mocked Leeds on Friday. Believe me, she would not be my first choice, that I can tell you, he said. He called Natasha Stoynoff, a reporter who wrote in People magazine that Trump kissed her and pinned her against a wall, a liar and told the rally to check out her Facebook page, youll understand. Many Republicans have sought to distance themselves from Trump. The most senior of them, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, angered Trump when he announced this week he would no longer campaign for Trump or defend him but would focus on trying to preserve the Republican majorities in both the House and the Senate in the election. Ryan gave a campaign speech in Madison, Wisconsin, on Friday without mentioning Trumps name once. He urged college students to look beyond the ugliness of the presidential campaign to focus on issues such as tax and healthcare reform. The kind of election we really want to have, its not the one were necessarily having right now, Ryan said, urging students to take the high ground. Trump on Friday also accused Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, the top shareholder in The New York Times Company, of helping to generate the reports of sexual misconduct. He said Slim, as a donor to the Clinton Foundation charity and who holds a 17.35 percent stake in the Times, has an interest in helping Clintons White House campaign. Arturo Elias, Slims spokesman and son-in-law, said Slim had absolutely no contact with the newspapers reporters or editors on their Trump campaign coverage and zero contact with the papers news operations. New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. said in a statement, Carlos Slim is an excellent shareholder who fully respects boundaries regarding the independence of our journalism. He has never sought to influence what we report.     Trumps allegation about Slim was the latest chapter in a running series of skirmishes he has had with Mexico and Mexicans. Trump kicked off his campaign last year accusing Mexico of sending rapists and drug dealers to the United States, and promised to build a wall along the southern U.S. border and said he would make Mexico pay for.

Tech investor Thiel to donate $1.25 million to Trump campaign,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Silicon Valley heavyweight Peter Thiel will give $1.25 million as his first donation in support of Donald Trumps campaign after endorsing the U.S. Republican presidential candidate earlier this year, a spokesman for the investor said on Sunday. The donation will be made through a combination of political action committee donations and money directly to the campaign, the spokesman said. So far, billionaire Thiel has been the most prominent supporter of Trump from the countrys technology hub. The New York Times first reported news of Thiels donation. A co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook Inc who sits on that companys board of directors, Thiel offered a full endorsement of Trump while speaking at the Republic National Convention in July.  Thiel has not made any donations to the campaign of Trumps opponent in the Nov. 8 election, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, the spokesman said. ",politicsNews,"October 16, 2016 ",1

U.S. officials step up rhetoric on Russia link to email hacks,"(Reuters) - Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence said on Sunday that evidence implicated Russia in recent email hacks tied to the Nov. 8 U.S. election, contradicting his running mate, Donald Trump, who has cast doubt on Russias involvement. Pences comments came after U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said in an interview that aired on Sunday that the United States would be sending a message to Russia at the time of our choosing about the email attacks. Obama administration officials initially refused to say if they thought Russia was behind the attacks, before accusing Moscow for the first time earlier this month. President Barack Obama said in an interview with NBC News that anythings possible when asked if Russia hacked into the Democratic National Committee. What we do know is the Russians hack our systems, not just government systems, but private systems, Obama said. But what the motives were in terms of the leaks and all that, I cant say directly, but what I do know is that Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, speaking about the hack of the DNC emails, said the U.S. intelligence community was not ready to make the call on attribution as to who was responsible. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson offered state officials help from hacking threats or other possible election tampering, in the face of unsubstantiated allegations by Trump that the system is open to fraud. Speaking at a conference in Washington, Clapper said that the Russians hack our systems all the time, but he did not officially blame them for the intrusions into Democratic Party organizations. During a live interview with the Washington Post, Clapper said Russia had a tradition of trying to interfere in elections in other countries. He added that his biggest concern was not that a foreign power would try to affect the outcome of the U.S. election but instead cast doubt on the whole process. The U.S. government for the first time formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations.  We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russias senior-most officials could have authorized these activities, the Obama administration said in a statement. Biden said in an interview with NBC News that the United States would send a proportional response to Russia for the hacking at the time of our choosing and under the circumstances that have the greatest impact.

Putin dismisses U.S. hacking allegations as campaign rhetoric,"GOA, India (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday shrugged off new U.S. threats to retaliate against alleged Russian hackers, saying such statements only confirmed that Washington used cyber attacks for political ends. Speaking after a summit of developing economies in India Putin also said he believed that the hacking allegations were mainly election campaign rhetoric by the White House, and that he hoped bilateral ties could improve after the U.S. elections. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden told NBC News television on Friday that we are sending a message to Putin, and that retaliation for Russias hacking attacks will be at the time of our choosing, and under the circumstances that will have the greatest impact. The U.S. government this month formally accused Russia for the first time of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. You can expect anything from our American friends. But what did he say that was new? Dont we know that official bodies of the United States are spying and eavesdropping on everyone? Putin told reporters after the summit of leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. The only new thing is that for the first time the United States has recognized at the highest level ... that they themselves do it (cyber attacks). Putin said that by playing the Russian card in the current election campaign, the outgoing U.S. administration sought to distract voter attention from its failures, which include huge state debt, weak diplomacy in the Middle East and strained relations with its allies in that region. I would like to reassure everyone, including our U.S. partners and friends - we do not intend to influence the U.S. election campaign, he said. Putin said he would work with any U.S. leader willing to work with Russia. If someone wants confrontation, this is not our choice, he said. On the contrary, we would like to find common ground and cooperate in solving the global problems that confront both Russia and the United States.  On Thursday, Russias Foreign Ministry accused the Obama administration of destroying bilateral relations in the run-up to the elections, saying that the level of Russophobic propaganda coming from the very top is now starting to go off the scale.

Transcripts of Clinton's Wall Street talks released in new Wikileaks dump,"(Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintons full remarks to several Wall Street audiences appeared to become public on Saturday when the controversial transparency group Wikileaks dumped its latest batch of hacked emails. The documents showed comments by Clinton during question-and-answer sessions with Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and Tim ONeill, the banks head of investment management, at three separate events in 2013 in Arizona, New York and South Carolina.  Some excerpts of Clintons speeches had already been released. For more than a week, Wikileaks has published in stages what it says are hacked emails from the account of John Podesta, Clintons campaign chairman.  Clintons campaign has declined to verify the emails. Goldman Sachs did not immediately provide any comment on Saturday. Clinton came under fire for months for not releasing full details of her paid speeches to big business audiences, as opponents accused her of a cozy relationship with bankers and other members of the U.S. financial system. The excerpts that have surfaced so far angered voters who backed Clintons former Democratic opponent, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who endorsed her after losing the partys primary. Few of these voters are expected to vote for Republican nominee Donald Trump, who is dealing with his own larger scandal after the release last week of a 2005 video in which he bragged about making unwanted sexual advances toward women. But Democratic strategists worry that disappointment with Clinton could hurt turnout in the Nov. 8 election among liberals and younger voters, posing a potential problem for the former secretary of state. In the email released on Saturday containing the transcripts, Clinton campaign staff highlighted sections that could pose problems, including saying political reasons factored into passing the 2010 Dodd-Frank law on Wall Street reforms and, while talking about regulation, saying the people who work in the industry know it best.

"After turbulent week, Trump revisits talk of 'rigged election'","PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, fighting to overcome setbacks and polls showing a tough path to the White House, on Saturday doubled down on his claim that the U.S. election is rigged against him. Trump challenged accusations from several women that he made unwanted sexual advances toward them. Trump spokesman Jason Miller denied a new allegation that surfaced on Saturday, saying there was no way Trump had kissed a woman without permission 20 years ago at his Florida resort. Trump told an outdoor rally in New Hampshire on Saturday that the media was sharing the accusations against him to boost Democrat Hillary Clinton and damage his own White House hopes. Trump has presented no evidence for claims he has made for months that the election could be fixed to prevent him from reaching the Oval Office. Leaders on both sides of the political spectrum worry that this rhetoric, which supporters sometimes repeat in interviews, undermines the democratic process. It looks to me like a rigged election, Trump said in New Hampshire. The election is being rigged by corrupt media pushing completely false allegations and outright lies in an effort to elect her president. He started the day tweeting several times that the election was being swayed by a media conspiracy.  This election is being rigged by the media pushing false and unsubstantiated charges, and outright lies, in order to elect Crooked Hillary! he said in one Twitter post. He reiterated similar claims at a later rally in Bangor, Maine.          Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, led Trump by seven percentage points in the most recent Reuters/Ipsos national opinion poll of voters. A new analysis found she was heavily favored to reach the 270 Electoral College votes needed to secure the presidency. Trumps campaign said on Saturday it had raised a total of $100 million in September, mostly from small donors but also including a $2 million monthly contribution from Trump.  At the same time, the campaign squabbled with the Republican party in Ohio, a key swing state in the Nov. 8 election, whose Republican leaders have not been shy about concerns with Trump.  On Saturday, Trumps Ohio state director released a letter saying that Ohio Republican Party Chairman Matt Borges no longer has any affiliation with the campaign. Borges responded that the state party had been actively helping Trump there. Trumps speech in New Hampshire was intended to focus on a plan to end deaths caused by opioid overdoses, something he often mentions on the campaign trail. But he deviated from policy proposals to air his allegations of election-rigging and his response to new groping accusations, 24 days before the election. Trump has been fending off the accusations since the release of a 2005 video in which he was recorded bragging about making unwanted sexual advances toward women. Trump has said the boasts were merely words and he has denied each of the allegations. The latest woman to come forward, Cathy Heller, 63, of New York, told the Guardian newspaper that in or around 1997, Trump kissed her on the lips upon first meeting her during a Mothers Day brunch at his Florida estate. She told the newspaper she leaned away, then turned her head, and he kissed the side of her mouth. Reuters could not confirm the allegations by Heller, who has contributed to Clintons campaign. The Guardian said it spoke to a relative who saw part of the interaction. There is no way that something like this would have happened in a public place on Mothers Day at Mr. Trumps resort, Miller, the Trump spokesman, said in a statement. It would have been the talk of Palm Beach for the past two decades. On Saturday, Trump deemed crazy another woman, Jessica Leeds, now 74, who said he groped her on an airplane in or around 1980.  He also denied allegations of unwanted contact by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Trumps show The Apprentice, who said he kissed her during a meeting about a possible job. Trump said Zervos first cousin called her a huge fan of Donald Trump, referring to a letter the campaign released to media. Trump also told the New Hampshire crowd that he and Clinton were like athletes gearing up for the final presidential debate on Wednesday in Las Vegas, and he implied Clinton might have been on drugs during their last match-up. I think we should take a drug test prior to the debate, Trump said. In the beginning of her last debate she was all pumped up at the beginning and at the end she was like uh, take me down.

Trump spoke at an event sponsored by the Republican Hindu Coalition to raise money for victims of terrorism. It featured Bollywood-style performers who danced in colorful, traditional costumes. If Im elected president, the Indian and Hindu community will have a true friend in the White House, that I can guarantee you, said Trump, who noted that as a real estate developer he has two massive developments in India. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has developed a friendly relationship with President Barack Obama, a Democrat who wants Trumps opponent, Hillary Clinton, to win the Nov. 8 election. We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism when Im president. We will stand shoulder to shoulder with India in sharing intelligence and keeping our people safe mutually, said Trump.  He called India a strategic ally and that we will be best friends if he wins the election. ",politicsNews,"October 16, 2016 ",1
LPGA happy to let USGA make Trump course decision,"INCHEON, South Korea (Reuters) - LPGA chief Mike Whan says the Tour will back golf authorities no matter what decision they make about hosting the 2017 US Womens Open at a course owned by presidential nominee Donald Trump amid a storm over sexually aggressive comments he made about women. The United States Golf Association (USGA) is facing calls to move the event from Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey in nine months time after a 2005 video surfaced in which he bragged of kissing and groping women without consent. Whan told Reuters in an interview on Saturday at the LPGA/KLPGA co-sanctioned KEB Hana Bank Championship in Incheon that he was lucky not to have to make that kind of decision. The U.S. Womens Open, the most prestigious tournament in ladies golf, is conducted by the USGA.  In a strange way Im lucky that the LPGA has no direct dealings with Donald Trump or Donald Trump properties, he said. Like any group we have people who are political in favor of different sides. Im not here to be a politician, I know that what the players want is that I dont get so political as to limit opportunities for women. All Ive said to the USGA is this, You have long since proven you support womens golf so if you tell us this is the right place to play then were right there with you. Whan took over in 2010 when the LPGA Tour was buckling from the fallout of the U.S. recession and his push for global growth has been a key factor in the circuits resurgence. One look at his business card tells you everything you need to know about his strategy for growing the womens game  the word commissioner emblazoned in English, Korean, Chinese and Japanese. Whan said he hoped the global flavor of the Tours  schedule and sponsorship could help mitigate the effects of another downturn at home. In the world of finance we have a pretty diverse portfolio, he said of a tour which makes stops in China, Japan, Malaysia, Korea and Taiwan in a late season Asian swing. More than a third of the circuits tournaments are sponsored by Asian firms or organizations. It used to be that one U.S. economic downturn could really cripple the LPGA, he added. Im not saying that wouldnt happen tomorrow, but generally speaking we are pretty well diversified regionally. Whan said now that the Tour had been put on a solid footing, with 33 official money events this year compared to 23 in 2011, the task was to boost the dollar value of tournaments rather than add new ones. I think we need to be playing for $100 million in purse money, he said of future targets. I said that back in 2010 and people thought I was nuts, but that was when we were playing for $30 million. Now were play for $65 million and I think well get there. The decision to add a fifth major to the annual tour schedule, the Evian Championship, was met with scorn by traditionalists and those outside the LPGA but Whan said it would be a mistake to be stuck in the past. Sports that are unwilling to change because of history and tradition become historic and traditional, he added. If we just want golf to be historic and traditional and not move forward, then we would have a real problem. ",politicsNews,"October 15, 2016 ",1
Clinton heavily favored to win Electoral College: poll," NEW YORK (Reuters) - After a brutal week for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Democrat Hillary Clinton maintained a substantial projected advantage in the race to win the Electoral College and claim the U.S. presidency, according to the latest results from the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project released on Saturday.  If the election were held this week, the project estimates that Clintons odds of securing the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency at more than 95 percent, and by a margin of 118 Electoral College votes. It is the second week in a row that the project has estimated her odds so high.  __________________________ STATES OF THE NATION Check out the state-by-state breakdown and run your own scenarios based on voter turnout The results mirror other Electoral College projections, some of which estimate Clintons chance of winning at around 90 percent.  For the Trump campaign there are a handful of states the Republican candidate must win if he is tocobble together enough states to win the White House.  Among them is Florida, but numerous recent visits to the Sunshine State by Trump and his vice-presidential running mate Mike Pence did little to dent Clintons advantage in the contest for the states 29 Electoral College votes. She leads by 6 percentage points, about the same lead she enjoyed last week.  Still, the race tightened in Ohio, another important state for Trump. Both Ohio and Nevada were leaning toward Clinton last week but are now toss-ups.  However, Clintons support grew in North Carolina and Colorado, both of which moved from toss-ups to leaning Clinton.  In the last week, the Trump campaign struggled to respond to allegations from several women that Trump had groped them or made unwanted sexual advances over several decades. Trump said the reports were lies and part of a media conspiracy to defeat him.  All of the allegations came after The Washington Post disclosed a video from 2005 of Trump describing how he tried to seduce a married woman and bragged in vulgar terms how his celebrity allowed him to kiss and grope women without permission.  The accusations overshadowed what might otherwise have been a difficult week for Clinton. Her campaign managers email account was apparently hacked and thousands of his emails were released by Wikileaks. U.S. officials say the Russian government sanctioned the electronic break-in.  The emails have been trickling out for two weeks. Included in the hacked emails were undisputed comments that Clinton made to banks and big business in a 2014 speech. In those comments, Clinton said she supports open trade and open borders, and takes a conciliatory approach to Wall Street, both positions she later backed away from.  Since that release, waves of other emails have been released, among which were some that suggested Clinton had inappropriately received questions in advance of a debate with Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primaries.  Without Trumps own woes, the Clinton emails may well have become the central issue in the campaign. Yet with just over three weeks to go until the Nov. 8 election, Trump does not have much time to turn the race around.  According to the project, Trump trails by double-digits among women and all minority groups. Among black voters he trails by nearly 70 points. To a large extent his support is almost entirely dependent on white voters. And while Trumps support among white men is strong, among white women his lead is negligible.

"How Trump rallies the faithful: Belittle Clinton, news media","CHARLOTTE, N.C. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps campaign rallies have turned into eruptions of barely contained emotions from his impassioned followers, who urge him to fight on despite a series of gut punches that have put his chances of winning in doubt. With the Nov. 8 election now only weeks away and polls turning against him, Trump is spending precious time in campaign speeches defending himself from accusations from several women who say he made unwanted sexual advances toward them. What he would do if elected is covered, but much of his speeches are spent belittling his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. He also accuses the U.S. news media of a plot to bring him down, and charges that the women who have made the accusations against him might be doing it for a taste of fame. Opinion polls show a gloomy picture for Trump. A week after a video surfaced of him bragging in lewd terms about groping women, the latest Reuters-Ipsos poll on Friday showed Clinton up, with 44 percent to Trumps 37 percent. And the crowds have gotten more protective of their hero. One woman at a rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Thursday wore a homemade T-shirt that said Trump Can Grab My, with an arrow pointing to her crotch. On Friday in Greensboro, North Carolina, a man wearing a Gays for Trump shirt punched a protester who held up an upside down American flag. Both were ejected. Trumps message has gotten through to his supporters in a big way about Clinton, who Trump calls a criminal for her handling of classified information as secretary of state. She would be the most dishonest and corrupt ever elected to high office, he said. A crowd of young voters had a ready response when he brought up Clinton at an event in Columbus, Ohio, on Thursday. Lock her up! they chanted, mimicking the lines voiced by older voters at other events. Trump could only smile and shake his head.  So young and so jaded already, he said. The New York businessman feeds off the energy generated by crowds that pack his rallies by the thousands. But he is easily distracted, lurching from topic to topic based on whatever happens to sprint to mind. On Wednesday in Lakeland, Florida, Trump jumped from bashing the news media as the most dishonest people youll ever see, to tout his performance at a debate in St. Louis on Sunday - which I won big league - to Clintons stroll across the stage in front of him at that event. And the papers said I invaded her space, he said. Believe me, the last space I want to invade is hers. There are moments of levity. A woman who recovered from a brief fainting spell in the heat of Lakeland was pointed out by Trump. That woman was out cold and now she is recovered  a little ding to the head, he said, approvingly. Trump can form an attack line against Clinton out of pretty much anything that springs to mind. Venting about Chinese trade practices before a raucous crowd of perhaps 20,000 in Cincinnati on Thursday night, Trump  suddenly imagined how China might treat Clinton given her bout of pneumonia a month ago, which had caused her to nearly collapse at an event in New York. If she goes down in Tiananmen Square, theyll just leave her, he said. Theyre tough people. Trumps crowds sometimes get agitated. Many of his supporters are upset at the news media, whipped into a frenzy by both Trump and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who in Cincinnati introduced Trump by condemning the insanity of the media, the insanity of the way they cover him. Upon entering the arena, Trumps traveling press corps was booed by thousands of people who chanted tell the truth. Trump boosters near the media work area repeatedly cursed and taunted reporters. When are you all going to be ashamed of yourselves? one man shouted. Lower than Congress  thats what your approval rating is. ",politicsNews,"October 15, 2016 ",1
"Obama meets with national security team on Syria, Islamic State","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama met on Friday with his national security team to discuss the fight against Islamic State and the war in Syria, the White House said. Reuters had reported that in the meeting Obama and his advisers would consider military and other options in Syria as Syrian and Russian aircraft continue to pummel the city of Aleppo and other targets, U.S. officials said. U.S. officials said they considered it unlikely that Obama would order U.S. air strikes on Syrian government targets, and they stressed that he might not make any decisions at the National Security Council meeting. A readout of the meeting released by the White House noted that the United States had broken off bilateral talks with Russia on reaching a ceasefire in Syria. It said Obama directed his team to continue multilateral talks with key nations to seek a diplomatic resolution to the civil war. The brief summary made no mention of other U.S. options in Syria. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will return to Syria talks on Saturday, three weeks after the failure of their painstakingly drafted ceasefire. Kerry has pointedly avoided new bilateral negotiations with Lavrov, and his invitation to the Turkish, Saudi, Qatari and Iranian foreign ministers to join them for talks in Lausanne, Switzerland, will broaden the discussion to include the most powerful backers of Syrias government and rebels. Pressure is rising for a halt to a ferocious, three-week-old Syrian government offensive to capture the rebel-held eastern zone of Aleppo, where the United Nations says 275,000 civilians still live and 8,000 rebels are holding out against Syrian, Russian and Iranian-backed forces.

North Carolina Democrats win extension of voter registration deadline,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - A state judge in North Carolina gave residents in counties hit hard by Hurricane Matthew five extra days to register to vote after Democrats sued to get an extension to Fridays deadline, while a federal judge ordered an extension in one Georgia county. The Democratic Party in North Carolina challenged the state election boards refusal to extend the cutoff date, saying in its suit that thousands of people would have been deprived of their fundamental right to vote in the Nov. 8 election if Fridays deadline was not extended by at least five days.  The judge ordered an extension to next Wednesday in 36 counties, a lawyer for the state Democratic Party said on Twitter. This ruling will ensure that those communities who have suffered from the devastating flooding brought on by Hurricane Matthew have the grace period that they need in order to exercise their right to vote and make their voices heard in this critical election, party officials said. Twenty-four people have died in North Carolina and thousands have been forced from their homes in the eastern and central parts of the state due to record flooding in Matthews aftermath.  North Carolina is a battleground state in the presidential election and could play a pivotal role in the race between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. State officials said this week they would not extend the regular deadline to register to vote, but allowances would be made for forms delayed by mail delivery. Those who miss the deadline can still register and vote on the same day during the statewide early voting period from Oct. 20 through Nov. 5. The state has a Republican governor, Pat McCrory, who faces a tough contest for re-election. The states Republican Party opposed any extension. It is clear that North Carolina Democrats, who have been dominated in voter registration by Republicans, want to use a horrific natural disaster to change the rules in the middle of the game, state Republican Chairman Robin Hayes said in a statement. In Georgia, U.S. District Judge William Moore ordered the voter registration deadline extended until Tuesday in Chatham County, which includes the city of Savannah. The judge said the administrative difficulties of doing so pale in comparison to the physical, emotional and financial strain Chatham County residents faced in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew. A federal judge on Wednesday gave residents in Florida six extra days to register to vote after that states Democratic Party sued for more time due to Matthew. South Carolina extended its registration deadline due to Matthew from Oct. 7 to Oct. 11. ",politicsNews,"October 14, 2016 ",1
"Obama eases restrictions on Cuba, lifts limits on rum and cigars","WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - Americans traveling to Cuba will be allowed to bring home more of the communist-ruled islands coveted cigars and rum under new measures announced by the U.S. government on Friday to further ease trade, travel and financial restrictions that have been in place for decades. Cuba welcomed the steps, part of President Barack Obamas effort to make his historic opening to Cuba irreversible by the time he leaves office in January, but said they did not go far enough. The latest in a series of new rules since the former Cold War foes began normalizing relations in 2014 will allow Cubans to buy certain U.S. consumer goods online, open the door for Cuban pharmaceutical companies to do business in the United States and let Cubans and Americans do joint medical research. For American travelers, the biggest change is the removal of limits on the amount of rum and cigars they can pack in their luggage, strictly for personal use. You can now celebrate with Cuban rum and Cuban cigars, U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice quipped as she laid out the policy changes in a speech to a Washington think tank. U.S. law still bans general tourism to Cuba, but the administration has used previous regulatory packages to make it easier for Americans to visit the island under 12 officially authorized categories. The latest measures are part of an executive order on Cuba through which Obama seeks to sidestep the Republican-controlled Congress, which has resisted his call to lift Washingtons economic embargo after more than 50 years.  Republican critics say Obama is making too many concessions to Cuba for too little in return, especially on human rights issues. After two years of President Obamas Cuba policy, the Castro regime has made out like bandits, said U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American lawmaker from Florida. The steps allow Cuban pharmaceutical companies to apply for U.S. regulatory approval, let U.S. firms improve Cuban infrastructure for humanitarian purposes and authorize them to provide safety-related aircraft services in Cuba, where U.S. airlines are beginning regularly scheduled flights. Also under the new rules, after docking in Cuba, some foreign ships carrying certain cargo will be permitted to travel directly to U.S. ports to load or unload freight. Until now, such vessels have been required to wait 180 days, a restriction that Cuban officials say hinders their import export trade. Josefina Vidal, the Cuban Foreign Ministrys chief of U.S. affairs, told a news conference in Havana the measures were positive but of a very limited nature. Today, I approved a Presidential Policy Directive that takes another major step forward in our efforts to normalize relations with Cuba, Obama said in a statement. Less than a month before the Nov. 8 presidential election, Obama said his goal was to make our opening to Cuba irreversible. The latest package, the administrations sixth, is likely to be the last significant tranche of changes during Obamas tenure, said a senior official, who asked not to be named. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton backs the policy of rapprochement with Havana. Republican Donald Trump has vowed to roll back Obamas executive actions. Vidal criticized Obamas directive for making it clear the U.S. aimed to promote change in Cubas economic, political and social system, failing to respect its sovereignty. In March, Obama made the first visit to Havana by a U.S. president in 88 years. His trip was made possible by his breakthrough agreement with Cuban President Raul Castro in December 2014 to cast aside decades of hostility that began soon after Cubas 1959 revolution. Since the opening, Obama has repeatedly used his executive powers to relax trade and travel restrictions, while pushing Cuba to accelerate market-style reforms and boost political and economic freedom. The changes announced to Cuba regulations are, by definition, significant because they are new, said John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council. Whether they will be relevant depends upon the government of Cubas willingness to permit United States companies and institutions to engage. This new directive consolidates and builds upon the changes weve already made, Obama said. He added, however, that challenges remain  and very real differences between our governments persist on issues of democracy and human rights. At the same time, the U.S. embargo against Cuba has remained in place, a major irritant in relations. Only Congress can lift the embargo, and the Republican leadership is not expected to allow such a move anytime soon. ",politicsNews,"October 14, 2016 ",1
Hacked emails raise possibility of Clinton Foundation ethics breach,"SEATTLE, Wash. (Reuters) - Hacked emails published by Wikileaks this week appear to show Qatar pledging to donate $1 million to Hillary Clintons familys charitable foundation, despite her promise to curb new donations by foreign governments while U.S. secretary of state. In an email from 2012, a senior official from the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation informs colleagues that a planned donation by Qatars government to mark Bill Clintons birthday came up in a meeting he had with the Gulf states ambassador in Washington. The ambassador said that he asked to see WJC for five minutes in NYC, to present $1 million check that Qatar promised for WJCs birthday in 2011, Amitabh Desai, the foundation official, writes in his email, using the former U.S. presidents initials.  Hillary Clinton, who is the Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election, served as secretary of state from 2009 until 2013. The hacked email is among thousands published over the last week by the pro-transparency group Wikileaks from the account of John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clintons 2016 presidential campaign.  Clintons campaign has been embarrassed by this and similar recent hacking attacks on other Democratic Party officials, some of which appear to show Clinton and her aides saying things in private that contradict their public positions. Her spokesmen have not disputed the authenticity of the hacked emails.  The emails released by Wikileaks do not appear to confirm whether Qatar gave the promised $1 million, although the foundations website lists the State of Qatar as having given at least that amount. There is no date listed for the donation. A spokesman for the foundation declined to confirm the donation. Reuters could not rule out the possibility the $1 million was intended as a birthday present for Clinton personally, not for the foundation. His spokesman did not respond to questions. Hillary Clinton promised the U.S. government that while she served as secretary of state the foundation would not accept new funding from foreign governments without seeking clearance from the State Departments ethics office.  The agreement was designed to dispel concerns that U.S. foreign policy could be swayed by donations to the foundation, which is known for its work on reducing the cost of HIV medicine in sub-Saharan Africa. Clintons Republican rival in the presidential election, Donald Trump, has seized on the foundation for political attacks, calling it a front for corruption. Clintons campaign dismisses this as a political smear.  The State Department has said it cannot cite any instances of its ethics officials reviewing or approving new donations from foreign governments to the foundation while Clinton served as the countrys top diplomat from 2009 until 2013.  You would need to ask the Foundation whether there were additional matters that it should have submitted for State Department review, the department said in a statement. The ethics agreement allowed foreign governments that already supported foundation projects to continue while Clinton was at the State Department. However, if one of those governments wanted to increase materially its commitment, then the foundation was required to ask the department first. Craig Minassian, a foundation spokesman, declined to confirm if Qatar gave the $1 million described in the 2012 email. Even if it had, he said he questioned whether the money would be considered a material increase. He said Qatar has been donating since 2002, and that some of those donations have been greater than $1 million. Qatars embassy in Washington did not respond to questions. A spokesman for Clinton, who was campaigning in Seattle on Friday, also did not resond to questions. Last year, Reuters found that at least seven other foreign governments made new donations to the foundation without the State Department being informed, partly, foundation officials said, because of oversights.  President Barack Obama is campaigning for Clinton to be elected his successor, and the White House has repeatedly declined to discuss the breaches of the agreement Clinton signed with Obamas administration.

Clinton leads by 7 points as Trump faces grope claims: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton leads rival Donald Trump by seven percentage points, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national opinion poll taken as the Republican nominee fought off accusations of groping women. The Oct. 7-13 poll released on Friday shows that 44 percent of likely voters support Clinton while 37 percent back Trump.       That was little changed from Tuesday when the Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Trump trailing by eight points.  Two more women came forward on Friday with allegations that Trump had groped them, including a contestant on his reality show, The Apprentice, as the businessman said accusations of sexual misconduct against him were part of a plot to discredit him only weeks from the election.    Trumps campaign for the Nov. 8 election has been scrambling to recover from the release a week ago of a 2005 video in which he bragged about groping women and making unwanted sexual advances  Support for Clinton has been mostly rising in the seven-day tracking poll since the last week of August, when the candidates were drawing about the same level of support. Since then, Clinton and Trump have faced each other in two heavily watched debates  contests that Americans believe Clinton won, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll.  Former secretary of state Clinton also leads the field in a separate poll question that includes alternative-party candidates. Among likely voters, 44 percent back Clinton, 37 percent support Trump, six percent favor Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and two percent support Jill Stein of the Green Party. The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English in all 50 states. The most recent survey includes 2,889 people who are considered likely voters given their registration status, voting history and stated intention to vote. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of two percentage points. National opinion polls have measured support for the candidates in different ways this year, yet most agree that Clinton is leading and that her advantage has strengthened as the election approaches. RealClearPolitics web site, which tracks most major opinion polls, shows Clinton ahead of Trump by an average of seven percentage points.         ",politicsNews,"October 14, 2016 ",1
Florida Supreme Court strikes down new death penalty law,"TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - Floridas Supreme Court overturned a new state death penalty law on Friday because it does not require juries to unanimously recommend capital punishment, a ruling with potential implications for ongoing prosecutions and 385 death row inmates. Executions in Florida, home to the nations second-largest death row, have been on hold since the U.S. Supreme Court in January struck down the states death penalty sentencing laws. Fridays ruling by Floridas high court marked another step towards death sentence recommendations becoming unanimous jury decisions in all U.S. states.  The U.S. Supreme Courts 8-1 ruling invalidated how a judge sentenced Timothy Hurst to death for the 1998 murder of a fried-chicken restaurant manager. It found Florida gave judges powers that juries should wield in determining death eligibility. In response, the Florida legislature this spring rewrote its death sentencing laws, requiring at least 10 of 12 jurors to support capital punishment, instead of a simple majority.  That law is unconstitutional because it requires that only ten jurors recommend death as opposed to the constitutionally required unanimous, twelve-member jury, the states high court found, adding that the law could not be applied to pending prosecutions.  Its big, said Marty McClain, a prominent Florida death penalty attorney involved in one of the cases. There is no constitutional death penalty statute in place until its fixed. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondis office said while it is reviewing the ruling pending a possible rehearing, juries in current active capital trials must make unanimous decisions in capital cases as to the appropriateness of the death penalty, a spokesman said in an email. Floridas incoming House speaker, Republican Richard Corcoran, said his chamber would consider options and called the ruling an effort to subvert the will of the people as expressed by their elected representatives. Among U.S. states, only Alabama and Delaware also allowed for non-unanimous jury decisions at the time of the high courts ruling. Delawares top court in August struck down its death penalty statute. The U.S. Supreme Court has directed a review in Alabama. This is significant going forward, said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, noting that non-unanimous juries in Florida and Alabama imposed a quarter of U.S. death sentences in recent years. Floridas Supreme Court vacated Hursts death sentence and ordered a new penalty phase hearing. It did not address the retroactivity of its findings for other cases. There will have to be searching scrutiny in nearly 400 cases, Dunham said. ",politicsNews,"October 14, 2016 ",1
Clinton warned U.S. would 'ring China with missile defense': hacked email,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said in a private speech to bankers three years ago that the United States had warned Beijing it would ring China with missile defense unless it did more to rein in North Koreas missile program, according to hacked emails. According to a purported Clinton campaign document attached to an email published by Wikileaks, Clinton said in a speech to Goldman Sachs on June 4, 2013, that the message to China had been, You either control them, or were going to have to defend against them. It was not possible to confirm the authenticity of the leaked email. The Clinton campaign has neither confirmed nor denied the authenticity of hacked emails. The State Department on Friday declined to comment on alleged leaked documents. When asked whether such a message had been delivered to China, an official said it was not department policy to comment publicly on diplomatic discussions.     Although Clintons reported comments raised a stir in Asia, they are consistent with U.S. efforts to convince China to help restrain North Koreas nuclear and ballistic missile programs, which so far have borne little fruit. According to the hacked email, Clinton said in the speech, which was delivered after she left her position as secretary of state, that Washington could not accept a situation in which North Korea developed an inter-continental ballistic missile able to carry a miniaturized warhead. She said this not only could threaten treaty allies Japan and South Korea, but also theoretically could reach Hawaii and the West Coast of the United States. Were going to ring China with missile defense. Were going to put more of our fleet in the area, Clinton said, according to the email. So China, come on. You either control them, or were going to have to defend against them.     China has been angered by plans announced this year by the United States and South Korea to deploy the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system to protect against the threat posed by North Korean missiles. The United States has argued THAAD is not aimed at containing China, but Beijing is concerned that the systems powerful radar would compromise its security. Current U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in February that the United States had made clear that the way to prevent THAAD deployment was to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. According to the leaked emails and in other paid speeches, Clinton also praised Chinese leader President Xi Jinping as a more worldly, somewhat more experienced politician than his predecessor Hu Jintao, and one who had worked to assert his authority over the Peoples Liberation Army. Clinton said she also told her Chinese counterparts that the United States had as much a claim to the Pacific as China, given that U.S. forces had liberated it in World War Two. China had a right to assert themselves, but the United States needed to push back to create a balance to prevent China taking a chokehold on sea lanes and countries bordering the South China Sea, she said.

"Trump hasn't sued a newspaper for libel in decades, records show"," (In this Oct. 13 story, corrects description of legal standard regarding Trump in paragraph 15) By Alison Frankel and Dan Levine (Reuters) - Donald Trump hasnt sued a newspaper for libel in three decades, despite the Republican presidential nominee repeatedly threatening to do so over the course of his business career, according to databases of state and federal court records.  A lawyer for the New York real estate developer demanded on Wednesday The New York Times retract a story in which two women accused Trump of inappropriately touching them. If the newspaper did not comply, Trump, who says the allegations are fabricated, would pursue all available actions and remedies, the lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said in a letter.  Trump said at a rally on Thursday he was preparing a lawsuit.  An attorney for the Times, David McCraw, said the story was of national importance and the paper would welcome the opportunity to defend it in court. Over the years, media outlets including the Wall Street Journal, the Village Voice, the New York Post and Fortune Magazine have reported receiving similar threats from Trump or his representatives in advance of unflattering articles. However, Trump rarely makes good on those threats, according to a Reuters review of court dockets in the database of online legal research service Westlaw, a unit of Thomson Reuters.    The last time he sued a news organization for libel was apparently in 1984. Trump filed the case after the Chicago Tribunes architecture critic called his proposed 150-story Manhattan skyscraper an atrocious, ugly monstrosity. In 1985, a federal judge in Manhattan dismissed the suit, ruling the critic had a First Amendment right to express his opinion. The skyscraper was never built. In the 32 years since Trump brought that suit, he has not taken similar action against another news organization, although he or his companies have sued at least three individuals and a book publisher. He was successful in one of those cases.  Book author and former New York Times reporter Timothy OBrien defeated a Trump libel lawsuit in 2011, after Trump underwent a grueling deposition by OBriens lawyers.  Trumps suit against OBrien, which also named OBriens publisher, Time Warner Book Group, alleged the author deliberately underestimated the businessmans net worth. A New Jersey state judge found in 2009 that Trump had not established OBriens actual malice.  Former Miss Universe contestant Sheena Monnin was hit with a $5 million default judgment after she failed to appear for arbitration in a case in which Trump claimed she falsely denigrated the pageant as rigged. The arbitration judgment was upheld by a federal judge in Manhattan in 2013. The court record indicates the judgment was paid in 2014.  The same year, a San Diego federal judge ruled Tarla Makaeff, who was lead plaintiff in a class action against Trump University, did not act with malice when she said in letters to her bank and the Better Business Bureau that Trump University engaged in fraudulent business practices. The judge, Gonzalo Curiel, dismissed Trumps defamation claim. Trumps attorneys, as well as a spokeswoman for his campaign, did not respond to requests for comment on his libel litigation record, including requests for information on any suits the Reuters docket search may have missed. U.S. courts have routinely deemed Trump a public figure in libel lawsuits. That means he has to show not only that the story is false, but also that the media outlet knew that it was false or published it in reckless disregard for the truth. If Trump were a private person, he would have to show the paper was negligent in failing to learn the allegations were false, which is a lower standard of proof. The New York Times attorney, David McCraw, wrote that the paper carefully vetted the allegations in the story. Any Trump claim will be difficult because Trumps accusers were on the record, said Jane Kirtley, a media law expert at University of Minnesota Law School. That would bolster the newspapers argument that it didnt act recklessly in publishing their accounts. Trump has vowed to open up our libel laws, if he wins the presidency on Nov. 8, to make it easier to sue news organizations. In reality, he would not be able to unilaterally change the laws because they are generally governed by individual states and court precedents. Court records show that Trump or his businesses have themselves been sued several times for libel or defamation. Most of those suits, including a complaint by a former tenant of a Trump condominium and another by a former dealer at a Trump casino in Indiana, were dismissed. One defamation suit against Trump survived dismissal, however. Stock analyst Marvin Roffman sued Trump for $2 million in federal court in Philadelphia in 1990, claiming he was fired from his job after publicly predicting the failure of the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City. Roffman alleged Trump defamed him in critical statements to numerous newspapers and magazines. After a federal judge refused to toss the case, the Trump Organization settled in 1991. An attorney for Roffman declined to comment. ",politicsNews,"October 13, 2016 ",1

Factbox: Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim and the U.S. election,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was set to add Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim as a target of his verbal attacks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.  It cited a Trump adviser as saying the candidate would accuse Slim, one of the worlds richest people, of helping to generate allegations in the media of sexual misconduct by Trump. Trump will claim that Slim, as a donor to the Clinton Foundation charity and the largest single shareholder in The New York Times, has an interest in helping her White House campaign, the newspaper said. Slim spokesman Arturo Elias told the Journal that the allegations that Mexicos richest man was interfering in the U.S. election were totally false Slim built his multibillion-dollar empire by purchasing troubled companies and turning them around.

New Hampshire Senate race is tight despite Trump focus,"(Reuters) - New Hampshires Senate race is a dead heat between incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte and Governor Maggie Hassan, polls showed on Friday, with the tight contest showing the limits of the Democrats attempt to tie her rival to Donald Trump. Hassan at a debate on Friday lashed out at Ayotte for having said for months that she would vote for, but not endorse, Republican presidential nominee Trump, whose White House campaign is struggling to fight off allegations about groping women.  Ayotte changed her position following last weekends release of a video in which Trump made lewd comments about women, saying she could not vote for him. Senator Ayotte until last Saturday was willing to vote to put Donald Trump in the Situation Room with access to the nuclear codes, and that shows a very concerning lack of judgment, Hassan said during a debate on WGIR-AM radio. I have renounced Donald Trumps statements on many occasions ... I have clearly stated where I stand on Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. I wont be voting for either of them, Ayotte said, adding that she planned to write-in a vote for Trumps running mate, Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. A pair of new polls released Friday and late Thursday showed the New Hampshire race tied. A MassInc/WBUR poll conducted Monday through Wednesday showed the Republican holding the support of 46 percent of 501 likely voters to Hassans 45 percent. A UMass Lowell/7 News poll of 517 likely voters found a similarly close result, with Ayotte holding 45 percent support to Hassans 44 percent. Both gaps were well within the polls margins of error. But that finding came as the UMass poll showed Clinton extending her lead in the state to a statistically significant 45 percent support ahead of Trumps 39 percent. That poll had a 4.4 percentage point margin of error. Clintons stronger lead in a four-way race, which also includes Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green party candidate Jill Stein, suggested that Hassans effort to tie Ayotte to Trump was proving ineffective with the states famously independent-minded voters. Senator Ayotte is a pretty well known commodity and her personality and views are strong, said Neil Levesque of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics. You have Republicans who dont want to vote for Trump who are going to vote for Hillary but are also going to vote for Kelly Ayotte because they want her as a check and balance on a Clinton presidency.

U.S. policy changes on Cuba will be tough to undo: official,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It will be difficult for future U.S. administrations to undo President Barack Obamas policy of easing trade and travel restrictions with Cuba because of the benefits associated with the measures, a senior U.S. official said on Friday. Weve increased the space for this type of travel, people to people exchange, commercial opportunities in ways that are already having a positive impact on the lives of Americans and Cubans, the official said. Turning back the clock on that policy would only take away those opportunities.  ",politicsNews,"October 14, 2016 ",1
Dozens of U.S. lawmakers request briefing on Yahoo email scanning,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of 48 lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday asked the Obama administration to brief Congress as soon as possible about a 2015 Yahoo YHOO.O  program to scan all of its users incoming email at the behest of the government. The request comes amid scrutiny by privacy advocates and civil liberties groups about the legal authority and technical nature of the surveillance program, first revealed by Reuters last week. Custom software was installed to search messages to hundreds of millions of accounts under an order issued by the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. As legislators, it is our responsibility to have accurate information about the intelligence activities conducted by the federal government, according to the letter, organized by Republican Representative Justin Amash of Michigan and Democratic Representative Ted Lieu of California. Accordingly, we request information and a briefing as soon as possible for all members of Congress to resolve the issues raised by these reports. Investigators searched for messages that contained a single piece of digital content linked to a foreign state sponsor of terrorism, sources have told Reuters, though the nature of the content remains unclear. Intelligence officials said Yahoo modified existing systems used to stop child pornography and filter spam messages on its email service.  But three former Yahoo employees told Reuters the court-ordered search was done by a module buried deep near the core of the companys email server operation system, far below where mail sorting was handled. The Senate and House intelligence committees were given a copy of the order when it was issued last year, sources said, but other members of Congress have express concern at the scope of the email scanning. Some legal experts have questioned the breadth of the court order and whether it runs afoul of the U.S. Constitutions Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches. Half of registered U.S. voters believe the Yahoo program violated the privacy of customers, according to a poll of 1,989 people conducted last week by Morning Consult, a polling and media company. Twenty-five percent were supportive of the program because of its potential to stop criminal acts, the survey found, while another quarter did not know or had no opinion. The congressional letter is addressed to Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. ",politicsNews,"October 14, 2016 ",1
Djokovic hoping Kyrgios can stop squandering his gifts,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - World number one Novak Djokovic hopes Nick Kyrgios can learn some life lessons after the Australian was fined by the ATP Tour for breaching its code of conduct during a contentious defeat at the Shanghai Masters. The Australian was beaten 6-3 6-1 by Mischa Zverev in a second-round match on Wednesday in which he put in a series of half-hearted serves and appeared to be walking off court before the unseeded German had completed his shot. The 21-year-old, who has had a number of scrapes with tennis authorities over his behavior in the past, also clashed with spectators before being booed off the court and was subsequently fined $16,500 by the ATP for his behavior. Speaking at the same tournament on Thursday, Djokovic described Kyrgios as one of the greatest talents that the game has seen lately, and said he hoped the Australian would stop squandering his gifts. Hes got huge potential, huge game, Djokovic added. I mean hes been doing well, hes around 15 in the world so youve got to give him credit for that, but on the other hand he obviously has life lessons to learn and hes still relatively young and hopefully that is going to happen. World number two Andy Murray said he would be happy to mentor Kyrgios. If he ever wanted to talk to me or ask me anything, I would obviously be open to that. You dont want to see young guys who are in the spotlight, struggling and making mistakes, doing things that ultimately hurt them, the Briton told reporters. A contrite Kyrgios did apologize via Twitter a few hours after his defeat. Not good enough today on many levels, he wrote. Im better than that. I can go on about excuses but there are none. Sorry #StillAWorkInProgress.  ",politicsNews,"October 14, 2016 ",1
"Exclusive: Obama, aides expected to weigh Syria military options on Friday","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama and his top foreign policy advisers are expected to meet on Friday to consider their military and other options in Syria as Syrian and Russian aircraft continue to pummel Aleppo and other targets, U.S. officials said. Some top officials argue the United States must act more forcefully in Syria or risk losing what influence it still has over moderate rebels and its Arab, Kurdish and Turkish allies in the fight against Islamic State, the officials told Reuters. One set of options includes direct U.S. military action such as air strikes on Syrian military bases, munitions depots or radar and anti-aircraft bases, said one official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. This official said one danger of such action is that Russian and Syrian forces are often co-mingled, raising the possibility of a direct confrontation with Russia that Obama has been at pains to avoid. U.S. officials said they consider it unlikely that Obama will order U.S. air strikes on Syrian government targets, and they stressed that he may not make any decisions at the planned meeting of his National Security Council.    One alternative, U.S. officials said, is allowing allies to provide U.S.-vetted rebels with more sophisticated weapons, although not shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, which Washington fears could be used against Western airliners. The White House declined to comment. Fridays planned meeting is the latest in a long series of internal debates about what, if anything, to do to end a 5-1/2 year civil war that has killed at least 300,000 people and displaced half the countrys population. The ultimate aim of any new action could be to bolster the battered moderate rebels so they can weather what is now widely seen as the inevitable fall of rebel-held eastern Aleppo to the forces of Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. It also might temper a sense of betrayal among moderate rebels who feel Obama encouraged their uprising by calling for Assad to go but then abandoned them, failing even to enforce his own red line against Syrias use of chemical weapons. This, in turn, might deter them from migrating to Islamist groups such as the Nusra Front, which the United States regards as Syrias al Qaeda branch. The group in July said it had cut ties to al Qaeda and changed its name to Jabhat Fatah al-Sham. ANOTHER TRY AT DIPLOMACY The U.S. and Russian foreign ministers will meet in Lausanne, Switzerland on Saturday to resume their failed effort to find a diplomatic solution, possibly joined by their counterparts from Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Iran, but  U.S. officials voiced little hope for success. Fridays planned meeting at the White House and the session in Lausanne occur as Obama, with just 100 days left in office, faces other decisions about whether to deepen U.S. military involvement in the Middle East  notably in Yemen and Iraq  a stance he opposed when he won the White House in 2008. Earlier Thursday the United States launched cruise missiles  at three coastal radar sites in areas of Yemen controlled by Iran-aligned Houthi forces, retaliating after failed missile attacks this week on a U.S. Navy destroyer, U.S. officials said. In Iraq, U.S. officials are debating whether government forces will need more U.S. support both during and after their campaign to retake Mosul, Islamic States de facto capital in the country.  Some officials argue the Iraqis now cannot retake the city without significant help from Kurdish peshmerga forces, as well as Sunni and Shiite militias, and that their participation could trigger religious and ethnic conflict in the city.          In Syria, Washington has turned to the question of whether to take military action after its latest effort to broker a truce with Russia collapsed last month. The United States has called for Assad to step down, but for years has seemed resigned to his remaining in control of parts of the country as it prosecutes a separate fight against Islamic State militants in Syria and in Iraq. The U.S. policy is to target Islamic State first, a decision that has opened it to charges that it is doing nothing to prevent the humanitarian catastrophe in Syria and particularly in Aleppo, Syrias largest city. Renewed bombing of rebel-held eastern Aleppo has killed more than 150 people this week, rescue workers said, as Syria intensifies its Russian-backed offensive to take the whole city. Anthony Cordesman of Washingtons Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank suggested the United States failure to act earlier in Syria, and in Aleppo in particular, had narrowed Obamas options. There is only so long you can ignore your options before you dont have any, Cordesman said. ",politicsNews,"October 13, 2016 ",1
Obama plans overhaul of child support payment rules for prisoners,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration, in its final weeks, plans to ease the legal obligations on prisoners to pay for child support while they are locked up, targeting practices that critics say can saddle ex-convicts with crippling debts. The regulatory changes, if put in place, would give President Barack Obama something more to show for his efforts to reform the U.S. criminal justice system, a legacy issue for the Democrat whose time in office ends on Jan. 20. As the first black president of a nation that incarcerates a disproportionately large number of black and Latino men, Obama has made it a priority to address problems that make it difficult for released inmates to reenter society. A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the new rules are not final, expressed confidence they would be completed before Obama leaves office. The rules would require that prisoners be allowed to lower the amount of child support they pay in prison, with the goal of preventing large debts that inmates struggle to repay after release and that can lead to reincarceration. Some Republican critics have said such a change would let parents flout their financial responsibilities. Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan last year introduced a bill to block the administration from making such a change. The bill did not become law. A Republican House aide told Reuters the administrations initiative would amount to a backdoor effort to avoid the legislative process. Criminal justice reform was supposed to be an area where Republicans and Democrats could find common ground in 2016, but legislative efforts have stalled. As a result, the administration needs to move forward on its own where it can, the White House official said. We are always happy to sit down and talk with Congress, but at some point we have to move forward with what we know we are legally permitted to do and what is right, the official said. Child-support programs require absent parents to send money, usually to the spouse who has custody, to help raise their children. For prisoners who have little or no income, regular child-support payments can accumulate into unmanageable debts. Just ask Glenn Martin. As a young father, he went to prison for six years for armed robbery. While in prison, his child support payments were increased to $400 a month from $50 a month, even though he only earned about $40 a month.   When he was released, Martin told Reuters he faced a $50,000 civil judgment for back child support, including interest. He said he tried to get that changed, butjudgessaid state law did not permit modifications for incarceration. Martin went on to found a prison reform group, JustLeadershipUSA. We have two decades of evidence that says that being tough just hasnt worked, he said. What it has done is further criminalize the people we should be trying to move into the labor market. Most states have changed their laws so that child support payments for prisoners can be modified, but 14 states still do not allow it or place major obstacles in the way. The Obama administration issued draft regulations in late 2014 that would require states to allow prisoners to modify their child support court orders, while also requiring state courts to set orders based on prisoners actual income. States run their own child support enforcement programs, but Washington sets nationwide standards and reimburses states for 66 percent of expenditures on the programs and provides incentive payments to states based on meeting certain targets.   The final version of the draft rules, still not public, was sent to the White House for review in July. Supporters say the changes will help reduce prison populations bypreventing ex-convicts from accruing debts that make it difficult for them to find legitimate jobs and increases the likelihood they could face jail time over unpaid child support payments. A 2010 administration survey found 51,000 federal prisoners had child support orders, with almost 29,000 of the prisoners behind on payments. The average amount owed was nearly $24,000. The child support system as it exists today in a lot of ways has become ... a major driver of mass incarceration, said Rebecca Vallas, managing director of the Poverty to Prosperity program at the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank.

Thai king's death adds to uncertainty about Obama's faltering Asia pivot,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The death of Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej on Thursday  adds a new layer of uncertainty to U.S. President Barack Obamas faltering pivot to Asia less than a month before the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential elections. The king was important in cementing the long-standing alliance between the United States and Thailand after World War Two, in a reign that spanned the Vietnam War and development of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which Washington still considers vital to maintaining its influence in the region. King Bhumibols death coincides with faltering momentum in   Obamas signature policy of rebalancing the U.S. diplomatic and security focus to the Asia-Pacific region in the face of Chinas rapid rise. The main economic pillar of the rebalance, the 12-nation  Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, is languishing in the U.S. Congress with no guarantee that Obama will be able to push it through before leaving the presidency to Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, both of whom say they oppose the deal. Clinton, as secretary of state under fellow-Democrat Obama from 2009-13, was one of the architects of the policy but Republican Trump has questioned the extent to which he would maintain the U.S. security commitment to East Asia. Obamas efforts to boost security ties with Southeast Asia have come in response to Chinas pursuit of territorial claims in the South China Sea, a vital strategic waterway. However, a torrent of anti-American rhetoric from new Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has cast doubt on the U.S.  military relationship with Manila just months after Washington reached an agreement on rotating access to bases in the country. Other Southeast Asian countries, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, are focused on internal political issues and are avoiding playing any leadership role in ASEAN, while even traditionally reliable regional ally Australia is treading carefully to avoid jeopardizing its economic ties with Beijing. Thailand was already occupying a back seat in regional affairs following a 2014 military coup seen as a means to maintain stability during the kings long illness. Thailand is expected to turn further inward during a prolonged mourning period and potentially politically fragile royal succession. King Bhumibols son, Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, who is expected to become Thailands new king, lacks the strong connection to the United States of his father, who was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Obama offered condolences to the Thai people and the Kings family, calling King Bhumibol a tireless champion of his countrys development. Obamas former top Asia adviser, Evan Medeiros, now at the Eurasia Group, said the mourning process would likely slow a return to democratic government and Prince Vajiralongkorn was a source of profound uncertainty.  Hes such an unknown, unpredictable figure, he said. U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States and Thailand had been close friends for two centuries. Our friendship and our partnership have weathered many challenges  we expect it to continue to grow stronger, Toner told a regular news briefing. While the United States backed a return to democracy, Toner said it would be premature... to lay our expectations for the near term as Thailand mourned. While Washington condemned the 2014 coup, it has kept  security ties with Bangkok, particularly through annual military exercises called Cobra Gold. The fact that we have been able to remain closely tethered and stayed largely on track with Cobra Gold and other cooperative efforts, notwithstanding the military takeover ... is testament to the strong roots we have put down and the work that were doing, the senior U.S. diplomat for Asia, Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel, said on Wednesday. Murray Hiebert of Washingtons Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said much had changed since Obama announced his pivot policy in 2011. The kings death adds to uncertainty in Southeast Asia, a region in considerable flux already. This makes the U.S. rebalance to Asia more difficult because the situation in so many countries is that of wait and see.  When the pivot started, you had Thailand engaged, a new leader in Malaysia who wanted to engage, you had Aquino coming in the Philippines and very forward-leaning internationally and very open to the U.S.; you had an internationalist president in Indonesia. It was a rather different dynamic. King Bhumibols death means Washington finds itself having to rely even more on former foe Vietnam for any kind of strategic ballast in the region. The Vietnamese are providing the dynamism when it comes to strategic thinking, U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Ted Osius said in Washington on Tuesday.  Indonesia is very internally focused right now ... Thailand is very internally focused, and Malaysia has a rolling political crisis, he continued. I dont know exactly what direction the Philippines is headed; Singapore has a lot of strategic thinkers but its a city state; I dont think you can really count on Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar to provide the strategic engine for ASEAN. There appears little prospect for now, however, that Vietnam would be willing to open its doors further to the U.S. military should the deal with the Philippines run into problems, given past animosities and concerns about China. I do not expect the Vietnamese calculation to be, Oh, the Philippines is doing whatever its doing, lets race full steam ahead with the United States. No, thats not about to happen, Osius said.  The Vietnamese have been very measured in the pace at which they have expanded the security relationship. Hiebert said Asian countries remain keen on the U.S. pivot, given their worries about China, but the pace was likely to flag further, presenting a tougher task to revive the initiative once Obama leaves power. I wouldnt declare the pivot dead ... I think theres still quite a bit of interest in the U.S., but some of the sort of dynamism that we saw earlier about building the region is a little bit diminished right now, he said.

Canadian court rules Trump can face claims in Toronto tower case,"TORONTO (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump can be pursued for some claims made by investors in a hybrid hotel-condo tower in Toronto bearing his name, according to a Canadian court ruling released on Thursday. An Ontario appeals court reversed an earlier decision to throw out a case brought against Trump and associates by the investors, who said they were misled into investing in the development in Torontos financial district. The investors bought units in the tower that were then placed into a pool of rooms to be rented out at luxury rates by the hotels operator. There would be no factual or legal basis to hold my client liable, principally because my client did not enter into a contract with any of the buyers, did not sell anything to any of the buyers, and did not receive any money from any of the buyers, said Alan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization. A lawyer representing all the defendants, Symon Zucker, said he was still reviewing the judgment to determine the merits of an appeal, but said he was pleased it contained no adverse findings against either Trump or his associate. As to the balance of the claim, should it be pursued, we believe that it has no chance of being successful, he said.  The 65-story property is managed by the Trump Organization. Lawyers for Trump and two others had argued that no misrepresentations had been made or that in any event they should not attract personal liability. Trump won a victory last year when a lower court absolved the real estate businessman of any personal responsibility, as his company had only licensed the Trump name to Talon International Development Inc, which owns the property. In the Court of Appeal for Ontario ruling published on Thursday, Justice Paul Rouleau dismissed claims against Trump and two associates for misrepresentation and breach of a ruling by a securities regulator. However, the judge said it was unfair for the original ruling to dismiss claims based on oppression, collusion, or breach of fiduciary duties, and said these can still be heard in court. Trump is still a defendant in this action...and he can still be held liable to these people for damages, said Mitchell Wine, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.   This court said youre still very much part of this thing, and you still have to answer to all of these allegations other than the two that the court considered in this decision. The ruling also said Talon must pay damages to one buyer for negligent misrepresentation and another sale must be rescinded. The case is: Singh v.

U.S. conservative group backs Republicans who favor clean energy,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A conservative nonprofit group that lobbies Republicans to support clean energy policy will spend more than $1 million over the next few weeks to back 10 members of Congress running in the Nov. 8 elections, hoping to attract key swing voters such as millennials.   Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES) is backing Republican House and Senate candidates who favor clean energy, even as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump mocks wind energy and calls climate change a hoax. Embracing a clean energy agenda can help Republicans win in close races by attracting key voters like millennials and women, and help broaden the Republican base, James Dozier, CRES executive director, told Reuters. The way I look at it is regardless of who is in the Oval Office, we need clean energy champions on the Hill, said Dozier, who added that Republicans have ceded the issue to Democrats. This is a ripe opportunity to reframe Republicans engagement in energy debate, said Dozier. We see this as an issue the party can use to grow the tent with the next generation of voters, with female voters and Hispanics and African Americans. CRES kicked off its fall spending campaign last week with more than $200,000 in radio ad buys for Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski and North Carolina Senator Richard Burr, who faces a close re-election race against challenger Deborah Ross.  The group will spend an additional $900,000 in support of other Republican candidates, including New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte, who is neck-in-neck with Democratic Governor Maggie Hassan in her re-election bid, and Representative Joe Heck, who is running in the hotly contested race for the open Nevada Senate seat against Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto. On the House side, CRES will spend money for ads and voter turnout efforts for representatives from Illinois, Virginia, Florida and New York. CRES is not alone in backing Republicans who can help the party embrace clean energy policy and accept the science behind climate change. Jay Faison, a North Carolina-based businessman, launched the $2 million Clear Path Action Fund to launch digital media campaigns for candidates, including Ayotte, who support clean energy in key swing states. But these Republican efforts are dwarfed by spending from environmental PACs that are spending record amounts to back Democrats. The League of Conservation Voters said it will spend a record $40 million this election cycle. Other groups, including green activist billionaire Tom Steyers NextGen and the Natural Resources Defense Council Action fund, have also announced tens of millions of dollars more in spending.

The Trump tightrope: Republicans weigh response with eye toward future,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With Donald Trumps U.S. election prospects dimming and controversy swirling around him, future Republican presidential hopefuls may be weighing whether standing by their man is the savvy move. Party strategists fear voters fleeing Trump will also fail to support Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, possibly costing the party control of Congress. If Trump loses the Nov. 8 presidential election to Democrat Hillary Clinton, his polarizing candidacy may reverberate well past 2016, tarring future Republican White House hopefuls, potentially including House Speaker Paul Ryan, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio and Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Trumps vice presidential running mate. Trump was struggling in opinion polls before a 2005 video released last week showed him talking in sexually aggressive terms about seducing women. Afterward came stories in several news outlets alleging Trump had inappropriately touched women.  Trump has angrily denounced the stories, the media and Republicans who have declined to support him. The brand has already been irrevocably damaged. Theres nothing we can do in the short term, said Doug Heye, a former top official with the Republican National Committee. Looking to the 2018 U.S. congressional election and the 2020 presidential election, Heye said: In two to four years, the stain on our partys soul wont be washed away. To be sure, a Trump loss is no guarantee the Republicans would suffer for long. Four years after Barry Goldwaters massive loss in 1964, Richard Nixon staged a Republican comeback. The conservative Heritage Foundation think thank has said Goldwater launched a shift to the right that would end half a century of liberal dominance in American politics.  For Republicans weighing a run for president in four years, deciding whether to back Trump may be a defining moment equal to what politicians faced in 2002 when they decided whether to back Republican President George Bushs Iraq invasion. By 2006, public sentiment had turned harshly against the Iraq war, some Republican politicians lost their jobs, and Democrats seized both the House and Senate. Republican presidential hopefuls of the future may be asking: How can I be loyal and stand by Trump while at the same time expand the partys base to include sectors the candidate has alienated?  More broadly, they may ask: Whats the right side of history? Trumps candidacy has attracted passionate support from a core group of voters but also driven away some moderates and independents. Republicans such as Heye fear Trump, who already has alienated large populations of Hispanic voters because of his hard line on immigration, will cost the party a generation of women voters as well. Ryan, Rubio and Pence all have, to some degree, sought to distance themselves from Trump. Ryan this week told colleagues he would no longer publicly defend Trump, in essence washing his hands of him. Rubio, who ran against Trump in the Republican primary and is fighting for re-election in his home state of Florida, has criticized Trumps remarks about women, but has not withdrawn his support. Pence is routinely forced to answer for his running mates conduct, but managed at last weeks vice presidential debate to outline policy differences with him. If Trump leads the party to crushing defeat next month, he may for years haunt Republican office-holders who supported him. I predict a chaotic round of finger pointing after the election, as people try to justify their position, said Jim Manley, a former top aide to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid who witnessed the Democratic wave in 2006 first-hand. Democrats are trying to link vulnerable Senate candidates to Trump at every turn. On Thursday, the advocacy group American Bridge highlighted Trumps praise of Rubio on local Florida television, even as Rubio has avoided appearing at any Trump events in the state. Clinton on Twitter this week noted that Ryan has not recanted his endorsement of Trump. Strategists say Pence would have the hardest time emerging from Trumps shadow. I think for Pence, its really tough, said Republican operative Liz Mair. Pence excited some conservative voters with his debate performance. A Politico/Morning Consult poll taken afterward showed him as the top choice for 2020 among Republicans, at 22 percent. Ryan, Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Rubio followed. Cruz, who was Trumps leading rival for the 2016 Republican nomination, illustrated the perils of trying to respond to Trumps candidacy. After holding out, Cruz endorsed Trump last month, just before the candidate went into a public-opinion tailspin. Cruz and Rubio, as well as Ryan, have come under fire from some Republicans for appearing to waver on Trump, at times standing by him and at other times criticizing him. People that waffle are going to have more trouble than people who pick a side, said Brian Bartlett, a Republican strategist who worked for Mitt Romneys 2012 presidential campaign. He said Ohio Governor John Kasich, another presidential candidate who consistently refused to endorse Trump, may emerge in the strongest position of all. Other potential 2020 contenders, such as South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, may benefit from not being on the ballot this year, thus being spared from being asked constantly about Trump while campaigning. But that assumes the anti-Trump forces in the party hold sway after the election. There will still be a significant chunk of the party who will view Trumps critics as disloyal, Bartlett warned, which may put some establishment politicians on the spot to explain why they did not do more to support the nominee.

"Factbox: Foreign leaders' criticism, praise of U.S. Republican candidate Trump","(Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps provocative proposals on immigration, trade and other issues have drawn attention and verbal attacks - as well as some praise - well beyond the United States shores. Here is a sampling. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have often praised each other. Last December, Putin described the New York businessman as a very flamboyant man, very talented. Trump, who lauded Putin in return, also spoke well of him in September, saying at a televised forum with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton that Putin had been a better leader than Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama. Some of the strongest criticism of Trump from abroad has come from Mexican officials because of his verbal attacks on illegal Mexican immigrants and his promise to build a wall on the southern border and make Mexico pay for it. Following talks in Mexico City between Trump and Enrique Pena Nieto, the Mexican president said the Americans policy stances could represent a huge threat to Mexico, and I am not prepared to keep my arms crossed and do nothing. Earlier this year, he likened Trump to dictators Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. In April, Chinese Finance Minister Lou Jiwei called Trump an irrational type because of the candidates proposal that tariffs on imported Chinese goods be increased to up to 45 percent. If he were to do this, that would be in violation of the rules set by the World Trade Organization, Lou said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. Then-British Prime Minister David Cameron in May called Trumps initial proposal for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States very dangerous. In December, Cameron had called Trump, potentially the leader of Britains closest ally, divisive, stupid and wrong for calling for the ban.  Nigel Farage, a politician who played a key role in the successful campaign to get Britain out of the European Union, lent his support to Trump in August, appearing with the candidate at a rally in Jackson, Mississippi. Farage said Trump represented the same type of anti-establishment movement that he had masterminded in his own country. Londons first Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan, said in May that Trump had an ignorant view of Islam, referring to Trumps initial proposed ban on Muslims. {nL2N18709R] In September, during his first U.S. visit, Khan expressed support for Clinton. French President Francois Hollande said in August that a Trump victory could make politics more conservative around the world and that the New York businessman made people feel nauseous. A Trump win could also affect Frances spring 2017 presidential election, said Hollande. Germanys European affairs minister, Michael Roth, said in August that Trumps assertion that Chancellor Angela Merkels open-door refugee policy had resulted in a huge increase in crime was incorrect. Roth said it was important to correct campaign statements in other countries that were based on fears, lies and half-truths, given the importance of the U.S. election for the world. In April, the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, criticized Trumps America First policy, which the candidate had unveiled in a speech that week. Steinmeier said world security could no longer be ensured unilaterally and that international conflicts could only be solved nowadays if heavyweights like the United States and Russia and others joined forces. The America First stance - which included a portrayal by Trump of longtime ally Japan as a free rider on security - also came in for a veiled swipe from Japans ambassador to the United States, Kenichiro Sasae, in May. Without mentioning Trump by name, Sasae said he did not want to see an isolationist United States. I want to see the United States to be strong and come with a strong robust position, not really thinking of the United States only, he said. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad al Hussein said on Wednesday that the world would be in danger if Trump became president. He cited Trumps views on vulnerable communities, including minorities, and his talk of authorizing torture in interrogations, banned under international law, as deeply unsettling and disturbing.

Trump's missing donors: the people who work for him,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kerry Woolard, the 37-year-old manager of Trump Winery in Charlottesville, Virginia, went online in June and made her first political contribution: A $250 donation to the campaign of her boss, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Woolards donation was unusual. Only a dozen of an estimated 22,450 people employed at Trumps companies have donated more than $200 to the celebrity businessmans bid for the U.S. presidency, a Reuters review of federal campaign finance records through August shows. Those who gave less to either Trumps campaign or his joint fundraising committees would not have shown up in the review.  The contributors, including an office cleaner, a golf course groundskeeper, a bartender and an attorney, have given $5,298 to Trumps campaign, a fraction of the $112 million Trumps political operation has received from donors and joint fundraisers. An employee at Trump enterprises gave $275 to the campaign of her employers Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. A 13th Trump employee, a lawyer at the Trump Organization, contributed to a Trump Super PAC, giving $1,000. Honestly, I wish I could do more, said Woolard, who addressed the Republican national convention in July and has attended private dinners with Trump, his wife Melania, and their son, Barron. He is an amazing boss, has been a great leader and I believe would do a great job for our country. Trump has made his business record central to his campaign. He often speaks about the thousands of jobs he has created and portrays himself as a dealmaker who drove hard bargains and avoided paying taxes to benefit his company, his family and his employees.  Those employees may vote for Trump on Nov. 8, and could be supporting his candidacy with smaller-dollar contributions that do not appear on the filings. But when it comes to putting more significant money toward Trumps candidacy, his workers have shown little inclination to support their boss.      That stands in stark contrast to the 2012 election, when Mitt Romney, also an affluent businessman, was the Republican nominee. Employees at the private equity firm Romney led and then retired from in 1999, Bain Capital, and a separate company for which he worked, Bain & Company, donated nearly $375,000 directly to his campaign and through joint fundraising committees during a comparable period in the election cycle, FEC records show. Bain Capital employees gave an additional $1.125 million to Romneys Super PAC. Clinton received $324,000 directly to her campaign and through her joint fundraising committee from employees at the State Department, where she served as secretary of state from 2009 until 2013, according to FEC filings through August. No State Department employee has given so far to Clintons Super PAC. A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, Hope Hicks, said in an emailed statement: Mr. Trump has self-funded the majority of his campaign so the comparison is not realistic.  A Trump Organization spokeswoman said: While The Trump Organization is not political, there has been tremendous excitement and support for Mr. Trump from his employees, those that know firsthand he is an incredible leader. After vowing to self-fund his campaign - and spending $47 million of his own money to defeat his primary challengers - Trump changed course once he secured the Republican nomination. Of the $112 million he raised, 43 percent came from people who gave $200 or less directly to his campaign.  A study published in September of companies on the Standard & Poors 1,500 stock market index found that employees political donations typically mirror those of their chief executive officers.  The study, conducted by business and finance professors at Arizona State University, Bocconi University in Milan and the Swiss Finance Institute in Zurich, found workers donated almost three times more money to candidates supported by their CEOs. The influence of the chief executives was particularly pronounced at firms that explicitly advocate for political campaigns. Reuters cross-referenced Trumps federal financial disclosure records, which lists him as controlling more than 500 entities, including some based overseas, with FEC campaign finance data.  The FEC requires that political campaigns disclose the identities, addresses and employers of anyone who contributes $200 or more to Super PACs, a campaign or a joint fundraising committee, which typically coordinates fundraising between a political campaign and the partys central organizing body. The estimate of Trumps total employees, 22,450, comes from financial data intelligence provider PrivCo and includes some entities abroad. Federal election law stipulates that permanent residents and American citizens, including those working outside the United States, can donate to political campaigns. But foreign nationals working for Trump operations either in the United States or abroad cannot. Six of the 12 people who said they worked for Trump on campaign donation forms did not respond to multiple requests for comment on their home and business phones.  Two had phone numbers that are not in service, according to a background search database. One confirmed his employment and donation before hanging up the phone. Another confirmed her donation but said she needed clearance from the Trump Organization to comment.   The only two who discussed their donations with Reuters were Woolard, the Trump Winery manager, and Fred Laderer, an 81-year-old employee at Trump National Golf Club in North Carolina. Laderer made two donations to Republican political entities, of which $56 was earmarked for the Trump campaign.  Laderer, who schedules start times for golfers, said since Trump took over the North Carolina club its a much better place to work. The members are much happier.  Still, he added that he didnt donate to Trumps campaign because he works for the candidate, but because Clinton would bring a lot of bad luggage.  ",politicsNews,"October 13, 2016 ",1
"Trump denies women's claims, says will provide evidence","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump denied multiple womens claims that he sexually assaulted them as totally and absolutely false.

Nothing in our article has had the slightest effect on the reputation that Mr. Trump, through his own words and actions, has already created for himself, David McCraw, vice president and assistant general counsel for the newspaper, said in a letter to Trumps lawyer. If Trump disagrees that the story was libelous, we welcome the opportunity to have a court set him straight, McCraw said in the letter. ",politicsNews,"October 13, 2016 ",1
Sanders among five senators asking Obama to order Dakota pipeline review,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and four other U.S. senators on Thursday called on President Barack Obama to order a comprehensive environmental review of a pipeline project that has stirred widespread opposition from Native Americans and environmental activists. After a federal appeals court on Sunday night denied a request to halt construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, the senators asked Obama to direct the Army Corps of Engineers to complete a full environmental impact statement, including stronger tribal consultation, for a contested part of the route. The projects current permits should be suspended and all construction stopped until a complete environmental and cultural review has been completed for the entire project, said the letter by Sanders and Democratic Senators Dianne Feinstein, Ed Markey, Patrick Leahy and Benjamin Cardin. Also on Thursday, the governments of 19 cities, including St. Louis and Minneapolis, passed ordinances to support the Standing Rock tribe in opposition of the pipeline. In recent weeks, protests against the Dakota Access pipeline led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota have drawn international attention, prompting the U.S. government to temporarily block construction on federal land.  Tribal leaders say the pipeline will desecrate land and pollute water, especially around the planned crossing through Lake Oahe, a sacred site. Opposition to the pipeline has drawn support from 200 Native American tribes. On Tuesday, anti-pipeline activists in four states, in solidarity with the Dakota pipeline protesters, closed pipeline valves to halt the flow of crude through arteries transporting 15 percent of U.S. oil consumption. A day earlier, actress Shailene Woodley was arrested in North Dakota while protesting the pipeline, an incident that was live streamed on Facebook. On Thursday, Amy Goodman, a journalist from the independent TV and radio program Democracy Now!, said she would turn herself over to authorities in North Dakota on Monday morning, in response to a criminal complaint was filed against her on Sept. 8 for trespassing. Goodman had filmed the crackdown on protesters by authorities last month. I was doing my job as a journalist, covering a violent attack on Native American protesters, she said. When fully connected, the 1,100-mile (1,770 km) pipeline would be the first to carry crude directly to the U.S. Gulf from the Bakken shale, a vast oil formation in North Dakota, Montana and parts of Canada. The $3.7 billion project is being built by the Dakota Access subsidiary of Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP, which has vowed to complete construction. There must be a serious consideration of the full potential climate impacts of this pipeline prior to the Army Corps of Engineers approving any permits or easements for the Dakota Access pipeline, the senators said.  Experts say that the full environmental review requested by the senators could take several months. ",politicsNews,"October 13, 2016 ",1
New Jersey citizen's 'Bridgegate' complaint against Christie can proceed: judge,"PRINCETON, N.J. (Reuters) - A citizens complaint against New Jersey Governor Chris Christie related to the Bridgegate lane-closure scandal can move forward, a judge ruled on Thursday, referring the case to state prosecutors to consider possible criminal charges. Roy McGeady, the presiding judge for Bergen County municipal courts, found probable cause for the criminal complaint filed last month by Bill Brennan, an activist and retired firefighter, a court official confirmed. The complaint of official misconduct accused Christie of knowing about a plot to close down lanes at the George Washington Bridge as an act of political payback. The governor has repeatedly denied any prior knowledge of the closures, which created massive traffic jams in northern New Jersey. The ruling ratchets up the political pressure on Christie, who became a major supporter of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump after dropping his own White House bid and now heads his White House transition team. The controversy surrounding the scandal, which has resulted in criminal charges against two of Christies associates, helped scuttle his bid for the Republican presidential nomination and has eroded the governors approval ratings in New Jersey. The misconduct case now moves to the Bergen County Prosecutors Office, which will decide whether enough evidence exists to support a criminal charge. The office has no comment at this time, spokeswoman Maureen Parenta said in an email. Brennan filed the complaint in municipal court in Fort Lee, New Jersey, where Christie allies were accused of deliberately causing a massive traffic jam in September 2013 by closing access lanes to the George Washington Bridge in order to punish the towns mayor. The bridge is a major link to New York City. The two Christie associates - his former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, and former Port Authority of New York and New Jersey executive Bill Baroni - have been on trial in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, for their alleged roles in the scandal. Brennans complaint was based on testimony from David Wildstein, another Port Authority executive who pleaded guilty in the case and has been cooperating with prosecutors, that Christie was aware of the lane closures at the time. A Christie spokesman, Brian Murray, said the governor would appeal the ruling immediately. This is a dishonorable complaint filed by a known serial complainant and political activist with a history of abusing the judicial system, Murray said. The simple fact is the governor had no knowledge of the lane realignments either before they happened or while they were happening. This matter has already been thoroughly investigated by three separate independent investigations. Brennan has filed numerous complaints, as well as lawsuits, against various officials in New Jersey over the years. Federal prosecutors have accused Kelly, Baroni and Wildstein of orchestrating the lane closures to send a message to Fort Lee Mayor Michael Sokolich after the Democrat refused to endorse Christies 2013 gubernatorial re-election campaign. At the time, Christie was already eyeing a White House run, and his advisers believed a show of bipartisan support would help enhance his national standing. Christie, 54, was among the 17 Republicans who originally vied for the Republican presidential nomination, but he dropped out of the race in February after failing to gain traction in the early voting. He became one of eventual nominee Trumps staunchest supporters. As head of the New York businessmans transition team, he would work to smooth the handover from Democratic President Barack Obama to Trump should Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. U.S. prosecutors are nearing the end of their case against Kelly and Baroni after four weeks of testimony. Lawyers for the two defendants have argued that virtually the entire Christie administration was aware of the scheme and have portrayed Kelly and Baroni as scapegoats. Both were expected to take the witness stand in their defense. ",politicsNews,"October 13, 2016 ",1
Moscow accuses Washington of destroying U.S.-Russia relations,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian Foreign Ministry accused the Obama administration of destroying relations with Moscow in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election next month, saying on Thursday that it hoped the next occupants of the White House would be better. In comments that underline how deeply a hacking scandal and differences over Syria and Ukraine have damaged U.S.-Russia relations, Maria Zakharova, the Foreign Ministrys spokeswoman, told a news conference Washington was playing a dangerous game. We see with regret how Washington continues to destroy our bilateral relations, said Zakharova. The level of Russophobic propaganda coming from the very top is now starting to go off the scale. Calling White House accusations Russia was behind a hacking campaign against Democratic Party organizations a lie, she accused the Obama administration of trying to make U.S. voters perceive Russia as the enemy. We have the growing feeling that the outgoing U.S. administration is applying scorched earth tactics to our bilateral relations, she said, saying such an approach was dangerous and could affect international stability. Zakharova also warned Washington to think twice before taking any retaliatory action over the hacking scandal, suggesting the Obama administration was gearing up to use the scandal as a pretext to launch its own cyber attacks on Russia.  Detailing Russian concerns over what it believes is a NATO build-up along its borders, she accused U.S. officials at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank of trying to block funds for Russia-related projects.  Of course, we understand that all these steps are being made to serve Americas internal pre-election set-up, said Zakharova. (But) nobody should be under illusions that its possible to put pressure on Russia, neither todays U.S. authorities or the people who replace them. We want to hope strongly that the new people will be smarter than the old lot. ",politicsNews,"October 13, 2016 ",1
Trump adviser accuses U.S. of disregarding Russia's interests,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A foreign policy adviser to U.S. Republican candidate Donald Trump has accused Washington of contributing to an atmosphere of mutual contempt with Moscow by disregarding Russias interests. Carter Page, a former investment banker whose views on Russia have caused controversy in the past, made the comments in an opinion piece for Russias state-controlled Sputnik news agency that was published on Thursday. From Syria to Ukraine to world energy policy, Russia remains an essential piece in the puzzle for solving many of Washingtons most pressing geostrategic challenges, Page wrote in the article. The U.S. government had shown a complete disregard for Russias interests, Page said, saying this had fueled a sharp deterioration in bilateral relations. Trump, the Republican nominee for next months U.S. election, named Page as being among five foreign policy advisers in March. Both Trump and Page are known for their more conciliatory stance toward Russia, in contrast to the views of many prominent Republicans. In a speech in Moscow in July, Page criticized Western countries for what he said was their hypocritical focus on democratization in the post-Soviet world. ",politicsNews,"October 13, 2016 ",1
"Trump touched us inappropriately, two women tell New York Times","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two women accused Donald Trump of inappropriate touching in a story published on Wednesday by the New York Times, claims his spokesman called fiction but which may further damage the Republican presidential nominees chances of winning the White House just four weeks before the Nov. 8 election. The report was followed by a stream of similar allegations from other women, putting more pressure on the Trump campaign as it lags in national opinion polls and struggles to contain a crisis caused by the candidates comments about groping women without their consent which surfaced on Friday. One of the women, Jessica Leeds, appeared on camera on the New York Times' website to recount how Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt on a flight to New York in or around 1980. (nyti.ms/2dx8k5R) The second woman, Rachel Crooks, described how Trump kissed me directly on the mouth in 2005 outside the elevator in Trump Tower in Manhattan, where she was a receptionist at a real estate firm. Trumps campaign denied there was any truth to the New York Times accounts. It made public a letter to the newspaper from Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer representing Trump, demanding it retract the story, calling it libelous, and threatening legal action if it did not comply. This entire article is fiction, and for the New York Times to launch a completely false, coordinated character assassination against Mr. Trump on a topic like this is dangerous, the Trump campaigns senior communications adviser Jason Miller said in a statement. Reuters could not independently verify the incidents. Leeds and Crooks did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters. We stand by the story, which falls clearly into the realm of public service journalism, a New York Times spokeswoman said. The report comes just two days after a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed one in five Republicans thought Trumps comments about groping women disqualified him from the presidency, and put him 8 points behind Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton among likely voters. Within hours, several other media outlets published similar reports. People magazine published a detailed first-person account from one of its reporters, Natasha Stoynoff. (bit.ly/2dTm90D) Stoynoff said Trump pinned her against a wall at his Florida estate in 2005 and kissed her as she struggled to get away.  I turned around, and within seconds, he was pushing me against the wall, and forcing his tongue down my throat, Stoynoff said.  The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the People story late on Wednesday. The article included a denial from a Trump spokeswoman who called the story a politically motivated fictional pile-on. Around the same time, the Palm Beach Post reported a claim by Mindy McGillivray, 36, a woman in South Florida, that Trump had grabbed her bottom 13 years ago while she was working at his Mar a Lago estate as a photographers assistant. There is no truth to this whatsoever, Trumps spokeswoman Hope Hicks told the Post. McGillivray could not be reached for comment. The reports come on the heels of a 2005 video that surfaced on Friday that showed Trump bragging about groping women, kissing them without permission, and trying to seduce a married woman.  I just start kissing them. Its like a magnet. Just kiss. I dont even wait, Trump is heard saying on the tape. Trump said during the second presidential debate on Sunday that he had not actually done the things he had boasted about, and apologized for his remarks, which he called private locker room talk. The bombshell video has jeopardized Trumps chances of winning on Election Day, and put Republican control of the U.S. Congress in danger. He was chastised by Republican leaders, and some called on him to drop out of the presidential race.  On Wednesday, Trump escalated his attacks on U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan after Ryan said he was no longer going to campaign for or defend Trump. Trump complained to thousands of supporters jammed into a livestock arena in Ocala, Florida, that Ryan and others had not congratulated him on his debate performance on Sunday, and the crowd booed in sympathy. There is a whole deal going on and were going to figure it out. I always figure things out. But theres a whole sinister deal going on, Trump said. Former Republican House Speaker John Boehner said in an interview on Fox News Channel that he would vote for Trump in spite of being disgusted by his comments, because he wanted to see conservative justices named to the Supreme Court. The interview was taped before the New York Times story was published, but Boehner said he thought it was likely that more negative stories would emerge in the last month of the campaign. What more could be said in this election cycle than has already been said? Boehner asked. It couldnt be any worse, could it? A spokeswoman for Clinton said Wednesdays report was disturbing. These reports suggest that he lied on the debate stage and that the disgusting behavior he bragged about in the tape is more than just words, said Jennifer Palmieri, a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign.

Trump tied with Clinton in Utah after lewd remarks in video: poll,"(Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps support has sharply fallen in Utah where a poll on Wednesday showed him tied with Democrat Hillary Clinton in a state that has voted Republican in presidential races for decades.     The survey of 500 people from Salt Lake City-based Y2 Analytics also showed a surge for Evan McMullin, an ex-CIA officer running as an independent.     Trump and Clinton were both at 26 percent while McMullin, a member of the Mormon faith that dominates in Utah, trailed just behind at 22 percent. The telephone poll of likely voters was conducted on Monday and Tuesday, after a video featuring comments from Trump about groping women surfaced last week.  The survey underscored the level of disaffection some conservatives have shown for Trump, who has found himself at odds with much of the Republican Party establishment. The last time a Republican presidential nominee lost in Utah was in the landslide national election victory of President Lyndon Johnson, a Democrat, in 1964. Theres limits to partisanship even in Utah of all places, Scott Riding, managing partner of Y2 Analytics, said. The poll results indicate severe erosion in Trumps popularity in Utah even as Clintons support has grown slightly. A Salt Lake Tribune poll in September put support for Trump at 34 percent, compared with 25 percent for Clinton. A number of prominent Utah Republicans, including Governor Gary Herbert and U.S. Senator Mike Lee, pulled their support for Trump or called on him to quit the race.  McMullin, a former CIA counter-terrorism specialist and investment banker whose campaign is based in Utah, is less well known nationally than the other minor candidates, Green Party nominee Jill Stein and Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson. Johnson ranked fourth in the Y2 Analytics poll with support from 14 percent of likely voters, roughly in line with his previous level of support in Utah. McMullin, who is running as a conservative independent, is on the ballot in a dozen states including Utah, with plans to expand his reach before the Nov. 8 election, according to his campaign spokesman Rick Wilson.  The vast majority of participants in the poll were familiar with the video tape of Trumps vulgar comments about women during a 2005 recording and a third of them said it lowered their opinion of the New York businessman. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.38 percentage points. ",politicsNews,"October 12, 2016 ",1
Putin rejects accusations of meddling in U.S. election,"WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted on Wednesday his country was not involved in an effort to influence the U.S. presidential election even as WikiLeaks released another trove of internal documents from Hillary Clintons campaign. Last week, the U.S. government formally accused Russia of launching a hacking campaign to interfere with the U.S. election process. Clintons campaign, which has charged the Kremlin is trying to help Republican Donald Trump win the White House on Nov. 8, took its allegations a step further on Tuesday when John Podesta, chairman of the Democratic nominees campaign, accused the Trump campaign of colluding with Russia. At events in Florida, Trump said he had nothing to do with Putin or Russia. I promise you, I dont have any business deals with Russia, Trump said at a rally in Lakeland. In Moscow, Putin said nothing in the hacking scandal is in Russias interests and accused all sides in the U.S. presidential campaign of misusing rhetoric about Russia for their own purposes.  They started this hysteria, saying this (hacking) is in Russias interests, but this has nothing to do with Russias interests, Putin told a business forum. Putin said his government would work with whoever won the U.S. election, if, of course, the new U.S. leader wishes to work with our country.  WikiLeaks, the organization started by Julian Assange that publishes leaked information on the internet, this week released thousands of emails from Podestas email account and has not said how it obtained them. Last week, it posted excerpts from Clintons private speeches to banking and financial firms.  The Clinton campaign has not confirmed the authenticity of the messages.  The leaks, coming as the election campaign reaches the final stretch, have the potential to embarrass the Clinton camp. In recent days, however, Trumps own campaign has been in deeper trouble over the emergence of a 2005 video in which Trump bragged about groping women. Many Republican elected officials have turned their back on him and Clintons lead in national opinion polls has increased. Trump escalated his attacks on U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday, deepening a fracture in the Republican Party.  Clinton, a former secretary of state, has repeatedly accused Trump of having overly friendly ties with Putin and Russia.  She has noted that Trumps foreign policies have tended to align with Russians interests, whether it has been questioning NATOs role in defending Eastern Europe, failing to recognize Russias intrusion into Ukraine, and supporting Russias actions in Syria.  Trump, a New York businessman who has never previously run for office, has shifted his policies on a wide range of issues, from taxes to the minimum wage to immigration during his White House campaign but his statements on Russia have been consistent. His friendly stance toward Moscow departs from the views of many prominent Republicans.  During a presidential debate on Sunday, Trump publicly disagreed with his own vice presidential choice, Mike Pence, who had called for a more hawkish approach toward Russia.     At that debate, Trump questioned whether Russia was behind the hacks, as the U.S. government has asserted. And on Wednesday, during a rally in Ocala, Florida, Trump echoed those remarks. Have you ever noticed, anything that goes wrong they blame Russia? Trump told the crowd. They always blame Russia and then they says Donald Trump is friends . . . I dont know Putin, folks. What the hell do I have to do with Putin? Trump has said that as president he would seek warmer relations with Russia and that it would be in the United States best interests to seek Russias help to defeat Islamic State.  Trump is the most pro-Russian presidential candidate ever, said Max Boot, a senior fellow for national security studies at the Council of Foreign Relations. Putin no doubt sees a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reorient U.S. foreign policy in his direction by electing Trump. A Russian ultra-nationalist ally of Putin who is known for his fiery rhetoric said Trump was the only person able to de-escalate dangerous tensions between Moscow and Washington, and predicted nuclear war if Clinton were elected.      Relations between Russia and the United States cant get any worse. The only way they can get worse is if a war starts, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a flamboyant veteran lawmaker, told Reuters.            Clinton campaign chairman Podesta said on Tuesday the FBI was investigating a criminal hack of his emails, and he tied the Trump campaign to the leaks by suggesting that a former Trump adviser, Roger Stone, had advance warning of the hacks.  The Trump campaign has not responded to the allegation about Stone, but Trump has denied any coordination with the Russian government to embarrass Clinton.  He has, however, made clear he supports WikiLeaks efforts. I love WikiLeaks, he said at a rally in Pennsylvania on Tuesday.  The United States has an ongoing criminal investigation into Assanges publishing of classified material. Clinton has been a fierce critic of Assange, who remains at the Ecuadorean embassy in London where he sought refuge in 2012 to avoid possible extradition to Sweden.  Last week, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and Department of Homeland Security said the government was confident the hacks of Democratic political groups and campaign officials originated from high levels of the Russian government. The White House on Tuesday promised a proportional response to Russia over the hacks.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told CNN the United States has offered no proof of his governments involvement, and suggested Moscow was unconcerned about possible reprisals. Ifthey decided to do something, let them do it, Lavrov said. ",politicsNews,"October 12, 2016 ",1
"Trump trails Clinton by 8 points after tape scandal, debate: Reuters/Ipsos poll","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump has fallen further behind Hillary Clinton and now trails her by 8 points among likely voters, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll, with 1 in 5 Republicans saying his vulgar comments about groping women disqualify him from the presidency.  The national tracking poll was launched after Sunday nights second presidential debate, where Trump was pressed to explain his comments in a 2005 videotape about grabbing womens genitalia. He described the remarks, which first surfaced on Friday, as locker room banter and apologized to Americans.  The poll released on Tuesday showed Clinton, the Democratic nominee, had increased her lead over Trump, the Republican nominee, to 8 percentage points on Monday from 5 points last week.  When asked to pick between the two major-party candidates, 45 percent of likely voters said they supported Clinton while 37 percent supported Trump. Another 18 percent said they would not support either candidate.  Trump was under pressure during Sundays debate to restore confidence in his struggling campaign after dozens of lawmakers repudiated him over the weekend. He hammered Clintons handling of classified information while serving as secretary of state and referred to her as the devil. At one point, he said he would jail Clinton if he were president. Among those who said they watched at least portions of the debate, 53 percent said Clinton won while 32 percent said Trump won. The results fell along partisan lines, however: 82 percent of Democrats felt Clinton won, while 68 percent of Republicans felt that Trump won. Among likely voters who watched the debate, 48 percent said they supported Clinton while 38 percent supported Trump. In the 2005 Access Hollywood video Trump boasted about making unwanted sexual advances toward women. When youre a star they let you do it, he is heard saying. Some 61 percent of those polled said that lots of men occasionally engage in similar conversations, and 46 percent, a plurality, said it was unfair to judge someone on conversations that they did not intend for anyone else to hear. Most of those polled said they believe Trump is a sexist, but they were split on whether his comments disqualify him from being president. Some 42 percent of American adults, including 19 percent of registered Republicans, said Trumps comments disqualified him, while 43 percent said they did not.  Among Republicans, 58 percent said they want Trump to remain atop their partys ticket, and 68 percent said the Republican leadership should stand by him.  The video doesnt appear to have worsened Trumps standing among women, who mostly had a low opinion of him already, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling over the past 12 months. When asked to pick between the two candidates, about 44 percent of women chose Clinton while 29 percent selected Trump - roughly the same proportion as measured in polls conducted before the weekend.          Trump, however, appears to be shedding support among evangelicals, who are usually a wellspring of support for Republican presidential candidates. Mondays poll showed that Trump had only a 1-point edge over Clinton among people who identified as evangelicals. Thats down from a 12-point advantage for Trump in July. The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English in all 50 states. The poll of 2,386 American adults included 1,839 people who watched the debates, 1,605 people who were considered likely voters due to their registration status, voting history and stated intention to vote in the election. Among the likely voters, the poll counted 798 Democrats and 586 Republicans.  The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points for the entire group, 3 points for likely voters and the debate watchers, 4 points for Democrats and 5 points for Republicans.     National opinion polls have measured support for the candidates in different ways this year, yet most agree that Clinton is leading and that her advantage has strengthened as the general election approaches. RealClearPolitics, which tracks most major opinion polls, shows Clinton ahead of Trump by an average of 7 percentage points, and that her lead has grown since the middle of September.

Clinton aides sought to minimize fallout with White House on Keystone: emails,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clintons presidential campaign looked for ways to avoid damaging its relationship with the White House as she considered how to publicly announce her position on the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, according to emails published this week by WikiLeaks. Clinton aides weighed having the Democratic candidate say she opposed the pipeline in a closed-door union meeting, leaking it to news media outlets or including it without fanfare in a policy fact sheet, the emails show. Clinton eventually announced that she opposed the pipeline on Sept. 22, 2015, at a town hall event in Des Moines, Iowa, early in the contest to win the Democratic presidential nomination. President Barack Obama, also a Democrat, announced that he too opposed the project on Nov. 6, 2015. The WikiLeaks group released its latest batch of apparently hacked personal emails of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta on Wednesday, just weeks before the Nov. 8 presidential election in which Clinton is facing Republican Donald Trump. Whether Clinton would oppose TransCanada Corps pipeline to bring Canadian crude tar sands oil to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico was a major issue in her Democratic primary race against chief rival U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who opposed the project. Clinton was walking a fine line on supporting or opposing the pipeline. The Keystone XL controversy put at odds labor unions, which thought the project would spur job creation, and environmentalists, who advocated moving away from tar sands-derived oil to cleaner forms of energy. Clintons decision was further complicated by the fact that the pipeline approval process began when she was Obamas secretary of state from 2009-2013. She said repeatedly that she would wait to announce her position until after the State Department had repeated its review of the project, in deference to her former boss. Privately, aides were figuring out the best way to announce her opposition to the project. We are trying to find a good way to leak her opposition to the pipeline without her having to actually say it and give up her principled stand about not second-guessing the President in public, speechwriter Dan Schwerin wrote on Aug. 7, 2015, in one of the apparently hacked emails. Schwerin was responding to a suggestion by Clinton Campaign Manager Robby Mook that they could use the Keystone announcement to draw news media attention away from Clintons use of a private email system while she headed the State Department. The Clinton campaign has declined to verify the authenticity of the Podesta emails released by WikiLeaks. Podesta told reporters on Tuesday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had notified him it was investigating the criminal hack of his emails as part of a broader probe. The White House last week formally accused Russia of hacking Democratic Party organizations in an effort to influence the presidential election, a charge Russia has denied. As a result, Clinton campaign officials and supporters have warned that such email releases could include fraudulent or misleading documents among genuine emails. There was no evidence to indicate that the Keystone emails - which provided insight into the campaigns struggle to announce Clintons position on a major Democratic issue that could put her at odds with the White House - were not genuine. Clintons campaign considered having the former secretary of state address the Keystone issue in a private meeting with a building trades union, then immediately roll out a fact sheet on her infrastructure proposals and publish an opinion article on the topic, the leaked emails show. But Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon thought it might be easier to forgo including Keystone in the policy rollout, skip the opinion piece and have Clinton state her opposition in the union meeting. I think we could seem consistent with our past statements about not wanting to get ahead of POTUS on Keystone if her position merely leaked out of the meeting, Fallon wrote in a Sept. 8, 2015, email, using an acronym for the president. That would seem like a private comment that she didnt intend to become public. Perhaps we could just issue an infrastructure fact sheet without mention of Keystone, and rely on the (Clinton) Keystone (position) to leak, either organically or with an assist from us, Fallon added. After Clinton warned at a New Hampshire campaign event on Sept. 17, 2015, that she could not wait too much longer and was putting the White House on notice that she would soon tell voters her position, Podesta checked in with White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough. Trying to calibrate whether we are threading the needle ok with you guys after Valerie getting her nose out of joint on Keystone, Podesta wrote in a Sept. 20, 2015, email, in an apparent reference to Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to Obama. Podesta said that Clintons comments on being frustrated with the delay were not a frontal attack on the president. ",politicsNews,"October 12, 2016 ",1
Judge gives Florida voters more time to register after hurricane,"(Reuters) - Florida residents were given six extra days to register to vote in the Nov. 8 election by a U.S. judge on Wednesday following the disruption triggered by powerful Hurricane Matthew in the state last week. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee extended the registration deadline to Oct. 18 after the Florida Democratic Party sued to seek more time. The original deadline to register had been Tuesday, before Walker ordered a one-day reprieve to allow for a hearing on Wednesday. Florida Democrats had argued that voters were forced to decide between their safety and their right to vote when Republican Governor Rick Scott ordered evacuations along a stretch of the states Atlantic coast as Matthew approached.  No right is more precious than having a voice in our democracy, Walker wrote in a three-page court ruling on the lawsuit. Florida is a battleground state in the Nov. 8 presidential election pitting Democrat Hillary Clinton against Republican Donald Trump, with opinion polls showing a close race there. It is the largest of the hotly contested states whose populations can swing either to Republicans or Democrats and thus play a decisive role. The powerful hurricane, which killed around 1,000 people in Haiti as it churned through the Caribbean, is blamed for at least 30 deaths in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. North Carolina now faces flooding from swollen rivers.   In its complaint, the Florida Democratic Party alleged that the states refusal to extend the voter registration deadline would have a decidedly partisan effect, noting that populations that lean Democratic, including minorities and younger voters, register in greater numbers just before the deadline.  It also noted that areas affected by Matthew have substantial populations of black and Latino voters who would be disproportionately likely to register to vote at the last minute. In past presidential years, up to 20 percent of all new registrations in Florida were filed during the week before the deadline, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, which helped bring the lawsuit. While we wish it had not taken a lawsuit to get the Scott administration to do the right thing, todays ruling is a major victory for all Floridians and for the democratic process in the Sunshine State, the state Democratic Party said in a statement. The judge earlier ruled that Florida law did not give Scott authority to extend voter registration and that he was not a proper party to the case. Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner, a Scott appointee also named in the lawsuit, was empowered to do so, Walker noted. The State will follow the courts decision and discuss with the Legislature possible amendments to current law, Scotts office said in a statement earlier in the week.  South Carolina extended its registration deadline due to Matthew from Oct. 7 to Oct. 11, while Georgia declined to do so.  North Carolina will not extend the regular deadline to register to vote, which ends on Friday, although allowances will be made for delayed mail delivery of registration forms, state officials said on Wednesday. However, those who miss the deadline can still register and vote on the same day during the statewide early voting period from Oct. 20 through Nov. 5. ",politicsNews,"October 12, 2016 ",1
Obama says Trump's comments on women disqualifying,"GREENSBORO, N.C. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Tuesday that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps comments on a 2005 videotape about groping women would disqualify him from even a job at a convenience store.     Speaking at a campaign rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Obama said the choice was clear in the Nov. 8 election even before the tape was leaked last week showing Trump speaking crudely about women. Now you find a situation in which the guy says stuff that nobody would find tolerable if they were applying for a job at 7-Eleven, Obama told the crowd, referring to the convenience store chain.  Trump said during Sunday nights presidential debate he was embarrassed by the video, but dismissed it as locker room talk. Obama also criticized some Republicans who have condemned the remarks but are still backing the New York businessman. The fact that now youve got people saying: We strongly disagree, we really disapprove ... but were still endorsing him. They still think he should be president, that doesnt make sense to me, Obama said. Earlier on Tuesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the remarks in the recording amounted to sexual assault.  Obama also took aim at Trumps business credentials,  referring to a New York Times report that showed he claimed a nearly billion dollar loss in one year on his taxes in the 1990s. They say the house always wins, Obama quipped about Trump, who was a casino developer at the time. I dont know how that happens.  ",politicsNews,"October 11, 2016 ",1
Trump intensifies attacks on Ryan with four weeks left until Election Day,"OCALA, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump escalated his attacks on U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday, deepening a fracture in the party with only four weeks to go until the Nov. 8 election. Trump, at a rally before thousands of supporters jammed into a livestock arena in Ocala, Florida, also attempted to drive voters away from Democratic rival Hillary Clinton with an overwhelmingly negative speech in which he described her as corrupt and unqualified for the presidency. Ryan said on Monday he was no longer going to campaign for or defend Trump and advised House Republicans not to support the White House candidate if they did not want to. His move followed outcry over a video that surfaced last Friday showing Trump bragging in 2005 about groping women and making unwanted sexual advances. Trumps response to being abandoned by Ryan, the countrys most senior elected Republican, has veered between saying he feels free now to campaign on his own terms and assailing Ryan and other disloyal Republicans.  Already the Republican nominee has a massive disadvantage and especially when you have the leaders not putting their weight behind the people, the New York businessman said on Wednesday, complaining that Ryan and others had not called to  congratulate him on what he felt was a strong performance at a debate against Clinton on Sunday. Youd think theyd say great going Don, lets go. Lets beat this crook, Trump said. No, he doesnt do that, he added of Ryan, as the crowd booed in sympathy. There is a whole deal going on there. There is a whole deal going on and were going to figure it out. I always figure things out. But theres a whole sinister deal going on. The release of the video has plunged Trump and the Republican Party into a deep crisis that has jeopardized his chances of winning the White House, when he was already lagging Clinton in national opinion polls, and possibly put Republican control of the U.S. Congress in danger. Trumps fresh round of attacks came even as his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, heard concerns from some House Republicans that Trumps criticism of Ryan was distracting from his message on how to defeat Clinton and win the White House. Conway convened a conference call with House Republicans who support Trump that lasted about an hour. A congressional aide said Conway went through a list of differences between Trump and Clinton and talked about how to make the case for Trump and against Clinton. The general theme of comments from lawmakers on the call was that Trump needed to focus on his message to the United States and distinguish it from Clintons, the aide said. The aide said members specifically brought up Trumps attacks on Ryan as a distraction from that message. The tone from House Republican was one of frustration at Trumps attacks on a fellow Republican, the aide said. The campaign and Conway did not respond to requests for their comments about the call. Nonetheless, Ryan has been facing considerable blowback from a number of his fellow House Republicans since announcing his decision to focus on electing Republicans in Congress. Oklahoma Republican Jim Bridenstine, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, tweeted on Wednesday that he will not support Ryan  presumably, for speaker in the next Congress  because of Ryans failure to defend Trump. Given the stakes of this election, If Paul Ryan isnt for Trump, then Im not for Paul Ryan, Bridenstine tweeted. Republican Senator John Thune, who called for Trump to withdraw from the race in a Saturday tweet, says his position has not changed but that he will vote for all Republican candidates on the ticket including Trump. I intend to support the nominee of our party. But hes got a lot of work to do, I think, if hes going to have any hope of winning this election, Thune told KELO-TV in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in an interview that aired late on Tuesday. Thune was among a string of Republican officials and former officials who called on Trump to withdraw from the race over the weekend. ",politicsNews,"October 12, 2016 ",1
Putin says U.S. hacking scandal not in Russia's interests,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The scandal that erupted in the United States over allegations Russia hacked Democratic Party emails has not been in Moscows interests and both sides in the U.S. election campaign are just using Russia to score points, Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday. The U.S. government on Friday formally accused Russia for the first time of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. And the White House said on Tuesday it would consider a variety of responses to the alleged hacks. They started this hysteria, saying that this (hacking) is in Russias interests. But this has nothing to do with Russias interests, President Putin told a business forum in Moscow.  Putin said the accusations were a ploy to divert U.S. voters attention at a time when public opinion was being manipulated. Everyone is talking about who did it (the hacking), said Putin. But is it that important? The most important thing is what is inside this information. The Kremlin said earlier on Wednesday it took a negative view of White House statements about a planned proportional response to the alleged cyber attacks. Putin complained that all sides in the U.S. presidential race were misusing rhetoric about Russia for their own ends, but said Moscow would work with whoever won the election if, of course, the new U.S. leader wishes to work with our country. About a decade ago, they wouldnt mention Russia at all, because it was not even worth talking about, such a third-rate regional power and not interesting at all. Now Russia is problem number one in the entire election campaign, said Putin. All they do is keep talking about us. Of course its pleasant for us, but only partly because all participants are misusing anti-Russian rhetoric and poisoning our bilateral relations.   ",politicsNews,"October 12, 2016 ",1
"U.S. lawmaker urges Saudi arms sales halt, cites possible Yemen 'war crimes'","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. lawmaker urged the Obama administration to suspend cooperation with a Saudi-led coalition conducting airstrikes in Yemen, saying in a letter released on Wednesday that civilian casualties from the strikes appear to be the result of war crimes. Rep. Ted Lieu, a California Democrat, wrote to Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday, saying the coalition had conducted more than 70 unlawful airstrikes in Yemen. It appears that either the Saudi coalition is intentionally targeting civilians or they are not distinguishing between civilians and military targets. Both would be war crimes, wrote Lieu, who had taught classes on the law of war when he was a lawyer in the U.S. Air Force.  His letter increases pressure on the White House over Yemen after the administration announced Saturday it was reviewing support to the Saudi-led coalition after an air strike killed 140 mourners at a funeral. U.S. arms sales to Riyadh and other support to the coalition should be halted until the White House review is completed, Lieu  wrote.     Lieu also cited a Reuters article published on Monday, which reported that the Obama administration went ahead with arms sales to Saudi Arabia despite some officials fears that Washington could be implicated in war crimes for supporting the Saudi-led air campaign. The Saudi-led coalition has said it takes its responsibilities under international humanitarian law seriously, and is committed to the protection of civilians in Yemen. State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement on Wednesday: We have received the letter, and are aware of congressional concerns regarding arms sales to Saudi Arabia. We, too, remain gravely concerned by the high toll of the conflict, including civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure caused by all sides of the conflict. Aid and assistance for any country are always under review and subject to modification. We are going to review our position and continue to have further policy discussions, Kirby said. Several recent efforts in the U.S. Congress to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia have failed. But the White House on Saturday announced it was initiating an immediate review of U.S. support to the Saudi-led coalition  after the apparent coalition air strike on the funeral. Saudi Arabia has said it will investigate the circumstances of that strike. ",politicsNews,"October 12, 2016 ",1

Trump as president would pose global danger: U.N. rights chief,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The world will be in danger if Republican nominee Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, the top United Nations human rights official said on Wednesday. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad al Hussein cited Trumps views on vulnerable communities including minorities and his talk of authorizing torture in interrogations, banned under international law, as deeply unsettling and disturbing. If Donald Trump is elected on the basis of what he has said already - and unless that changes - I think it is without any doubt that he would be dangerous from an international point of view, Zeid told a news briefing in Geneva. Trump lashed out at U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other disloyal Republicans on Tuesday and vowed to campaign in whatever style he wants now that the party establishment has largely abandoned him. This occurred after a 2005 video surfaced last week showing him bragging crudely about groping women and making unwanted sexual advances. Trump has said he would immediately re-authorize the waterboarding of suspected militants if elected on Nov. 8, contending that torture works.  U.S. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, signed an executive order after taking office in January 2009 that banned waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques. Such executive orders can be rescinded by a successor. Zeid said that he would rather not interfere in political campaigns. But when a candidates comments pointed to a potential use of torture, prohibited under the Convention against Torture, a pact ratified by Washington, or to vulnerable groups possibly losing their basic rights, he had to speak out. In a speech in The Hague last month, Zeid accused Trump of spreading humiliating racial and religious prejudice and warned of a rise of populist politics that could turn violent. I always believe that its incumbent on leaders to lead and to lead in a way that is ethical and moral, Zeid said on Wednesday, when asked about Trump. The use of half-truths is a very clever political device. Because as every propagandist knows, you allow the listener to fill in the rest. Trump has portrayed himself as tough on national security and promised to build a wall to stop Mexican immigrant rapists from crossing the border.  We have to be on guard to see that in the end vulnerable populations, populations at risk do not again see their rights deprived because of a view that is in the ascendancy based on false premises, Zeid said.

"Trump assails House speaker Ryan, McCain as 'disloyal'","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump lashed out at U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other disloyal Republicans on Tuesday and vowed to campaign in whatever style he wants now that the party establishment has largely abandoned him. Trump, in a barrage of stinging Twitter posts, condemned the Republicans who have backed away from his White House run, deepening a dramatic rift in the party over his struggling campaign for the Nov. 8 election. It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to, Trump said on Twitter, adding he would engage Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on his own terms. Describing disloyal Republicans as more difficult than Clinton, he said: They come at you from all sides. They dont know how to win - I will teach them! A string of Republican officials and officeholders have distanced themselves from Trump since a 2005 video surfaced on Friday showing him bragging crudely to a reporter about groping women and making unwanted sexual advances. Despite the turn away from Trump by some elected Republicans, a Reuters/Ipsos poll of likely voters, released on Tuesday, found 58 percent of Republicans wanted Trump to stay atop their partys ticket and 68 percent said the Republican leadership should stand by him. The poll, which was conducted after the second presidential debate on Sunday, showed Clintons lead over Trump widening to 8 points from 5 points last week, before the release of the video.  Ryan, the top Republican in Congress, told party lawmakers on Monday he was breaking with Trump and would not campaign for him, all but conceding Clinton would win the presidency. The move angered some Trump supporters, although Ryan said he would not withdraw his endorsement of the New York businessman. Trump slammed Ryan as a very weak and ineffective leader and complained in another tweet that it was hard to do well with zero support from Ryan and others. He later said in an interview with Fox News host Bill OReilly he neither wanted nor needed Ryans support. Ryans spokesman, Brendan Buck, said on Tuesday that the speaker is focusing the next month on defeating Democrats, and all Republicans running for office should probably do the same. Trump also took aim at U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, who said on Saturday that he could not vote for Trump. The very foul mouthed Sen. John McCain begged for my support during his primary (I gave, he won), then dropped me over locker room remarks, Trump said. There was no immediate reaction from McCain, who secured his primary election win in August.  Many Republicans worry that Trumps chaotic campaign could hurt their chances of holding majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in next months election, and will inflict long-term damage on the party. In an extraordinary party revolt, nearly half of all 331 incumbent Republican senators, House members and governors have condemned Trumps lewd remarks on the video, and roughly one in 10 has called for him to drop out of the race, a Reuters review of official statements and local news coverage indicates. Unlike Ryan, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus told RNC members on Monday that the committee, the partys leadership and fundraising arm, still backed Trump, two RNC members told Reuters.  Trumps vice presidential running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, also reinforced his support in television interviews on Monday. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former 2016 Republican presidential contender who has became a close ally of Trump, also reaffirmed his backing, although he called Trumps comments in the 2005 video completely indefensible.  Trump, 70, who has portrayed himself as tough on national security, released a hard-hitting television advertisement on Tuesday featuring footage of Clinton, a 68-year-old former secretary of state, stumbling last month after leaving a service commemorating the Sept. 11 attacks. Her campaign said she had been diagnosed a few days earlier with pneumonia. Hillary Clinton doesnt have the fortitude, strength or stamina to lead in our world, the ads narrator says. She failed as secretary of state. Dont let her fail us again. Both Trump and Clinton headed to the key battleground state of Florida on Tuesday. Before her Florida rally with former Vice President Al Gore, Clinton told a Miami radio station that Trump had insulted everyone. People need to understand whats at stake in this election, she told WMBM. The White House said on Tuesday that Trumps remarks about groping women in the video amounted to sexual assault. President Barack Obama said Trumps remarks would disqualify him from a job at a convenience store, and should disqualify him from becoming president.  Clinton, the first woman to be picked as a presidential nominee by a major U.S. party, tried to focus on Tuesday on issues that could win over undecided women voters, proposing to expand the child tax credit so that more low-income families can benefit and to increase by $1,000 a year the tax credit available to families for each child up to age 4.

Former VP Gore reminds Clinton supporters of 2000 vote recount,"MIAMI, Fla. (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton recruited Al Gore, the former vice president in her husbands administration, to raise the specter of Gores loss to former President George W. Bush in the contentious 2000 U.S. election to urge voters to go to the polls next month. Take it from me, Gore told a crowd of several hundred Clinton supporters at a campaign event in a college gymnasium. Every single vote counts. Every single vote counts. As he campaigned for Clinton at Miami Dade College ahead of the Nov. 8 election that pits her against Republican nominee Donald Trump, Gore reminded voters of the Florida recount saga 16 years ago. Bush was declared the winner in the state by a mere 537 votes after the intervention of the U.S. Supreme Court. Your vote really, really, really counts, Gore said. You can consider me as an exhibit A of that. For those of you who are younger than 25 you might not remember the election of 2000 and what happened here in Florida. For those of you older than 25, I heard you murmuring just now, but take it from me it was a very close election. A chant grew out of the crowd: You won! You won! Gore, who served as vice president under President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 2001, also sought to put a spotlight on the fight against climate change, which has long been his signature issue. When it comes to the most urgent issue facing our country and the world the choice in this election is extremely clear: Hillary Clinton will make solving the climate crisis a top national priority, Gore said. Her opponent, based on the ideas he has presented, would take us toward a climate catastrophe. Clinton highlighted comments from her rival Donald Trump expressing skepticism about climate change. In 2012, he said on his Twitter account that the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to benefit its manufacturing sector.  We cannot put a climate denier in the White House, at all, she said. We need a president who believes in science. ",politicsNews,"October 12, 2016 ",1
Obama tells students at town hall about how failures have shaped him,"GREENSBORO, N.C. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama won two straight elections for the White House, but on Tuesday during a talk with students at a town hall on race and sports he discussed a few times when he did not always come out on top.  Obama recounted the fallout from his first presidential debate in his ultimately successful 2012 election race against Republican Mitt Romney. I had that first debate, which was roundly panned. Everybody said you were terrible, Obama said at the town hall hosted by ESPNs The Undefeated at North Carolina A&T State University. What is true is that Ive always kind of hated these debate formats, so it wasnt my best performance. He said what really inspired him to dig deep for the second debate was seeing young volunteers around the country. While they put on a brave face, Obama said he could tell they were worried about the race. I just thought to myself these kids are pouring their hearts and souls into making calls and knocking on doors, Im not going to disappoint them, he said.  Obama also described his experience losing his first campaign for a U.S. congressional seat in 2000 and how it humbled him. Without that defeat, Obama said he did not believe he would have went on to win his Senate race in 2004.  What is true about politics that is similar to sports, though, is when you lose, you lose publicly, he said. Its a hard feeling. One of the benefits of defeat is to take some of the vanity out of what it is youre trying to achieve. The issue of race and sports has been in the spotlight recently after NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers started a controversial movement when he chose to stay seated, and then later opted to kneel, for the national anthem this season to protest racial injustice.  Asked about sports and activism, Obama cited two of his childhood sports heroes: boxer Muhammad Ali and tennis player Arthur Ashe. Both had totally different styles, with Obama saying Ali was more outspoken and Ashe more buttoned down. But he said they both brought about change. How you do it is less important than your commitment to use whatever platforms you have to speak to the issues that matter, he said. ",politicsNews,"October 12, 2016 ",1
Clinton opposition to Asia trade pact 'close call': hacked emails,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hillary Clintons campaign was worried about the hard balance she would need to strike as the presidential candidate prepared to oppose a Pacific trade pact championed by President Barack Obama that she once supported, according to emails published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks released its latest batch of apparently hacked personal emails of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta with exactly four weeks left in the 2016 presidential campaign before the Nov. 8 election. White House hopefuls have made trade a key theme of their campaigns, with the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a prime target for criticism by both Democrat Clinton and Republican opponent Donald Trump.  In an Oct. 6, 2015, email the day after the Obama administration finalized the details of the TPP, Clinton speechwriter Dan Schwerin circulated a new draft of a statement the campaign was preparing about Clintons position, according to WikiLeaks. This is indeed a hard balance to strike, Schwerin wrote in the email to a handful of top advisers, since we dont want to invite mockery for being too enthusiastically opposed to a deal she once championed, or over-claiming how bad it is, since its a very close call on the merits.  The next day, as she campaigned in Iowa, the first state to pick candidates during the nominating contest, the campaign released a statement from Clinton saying the pact did not meet the very high bar she had set to earn her support. The Clinton campaign declined to verify the authenticity of the latest batch of Podesta emails released by WikiLeaks. Podesta told reporters on Tuesday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation notified him it is investigating the criminal hack of his emails published by WikiLeaks as part of a broader political hacking probe. The U.S. government last week formally accused Russia of hacking Democratic Party organizations in an effort to influence the presidential election, a charge Russia has denied. As a result, Clinton campaign officials and supporters have warned that such email releases could include fraudulent or misleading documents among genuine emails.   Clintons October 2015 announcement on the TPP came just a week before the first debate in her primary race against U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, a vocal opponent of the deal. Key Democratic constituencies, such as progressives and organized labor, have also criticized the pact. Clinton had previously declined to say whether she would support the TPP, a main tenet of Obamas strategic pivot to Asia that began when she was his secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, explaining that she wanted to wait to assess the final negotiated terms. I accept the position were taking but she has generally been more pro-trade than anti, Clinton strategist Joel Benenson responded to the draft from Schwerin. While were opposing this, dont we want to say something generally about ensuring American manufacturers can compete around the world? Clintons nascent campaign began meeting with advisers to U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren even before Clinton announced her second White House bid, according to the hacked emails. In a January 2015 email sent three months before Clinton officially launched her campaign, Schwerin briefed close aides about a meeting with a longtime policy adviser to Warren, a firebrand leader of the Democratic Partys liberal wing.  Warrens team was concerned that Clinton would staff her campaign with economic advisers that were too closely associated with the centrist policies of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, such as those championed by his Treasury secretary, Robert Rubin. The Warren adviser, Dan Geldon, laid out a detailed case against the Bob Rubin school of Democratic policy makers, was very critical of the Obama administrations choices, Schwerin wrote. Schwerin said he and Geldon went over a list of recommended hires that Warren had sent to Clinton. Geldon told him they would be watching carefully to see how Clinton staffed her campaign, Schwerin wrote. They seem wary - and pretty convinced that the Rubin folks have the inside track with us whether we realize it yet or not, Schwerin wrote of Warrens advisers. Geldon declined to comment on the email. Schwerin also added that Geldon expressed some flexibility on Glass-Steagall, a Depression-era law that prohibited commercial banks from engaging in risky trading activities that was repealed during Bill Clintons administration. Said too big too fail is the bigger issue, Schwerin wrote. Many Democratic activists believe that reinstating Glass-Steagall would help prevent future financial crises such as the one that rocked the U.S. economy in 2008. Warren has said that there are two ways to break up too-big banks, either based on size alone or by instituting a modern version of Glass-Steagall. She introduced a bill in the U.S. Senate to reinstate a version of the law. Clinton weighed supporting a new Glass-Steagall law but eventually rejected that route, announcing a risk-based approach for breaking up banks, according to an email WikiLeaks released on Monday.

Surge in U.S. Latino vote could be elusive in presidential election: survey,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps hardline rhetoric on immigration might not trigger the surge in Latino voter turnout for which many activists are hoping, according to a Pew Research Center survey released on Tuesday. About 89 percent of Latino registered voters who were surveyed said they planned to vote in the Nov. 8 election, down from 91 percent who said in October 2012 that they were planning to vote in that years election. The decrease was within the surveys plus or minus 4.6 percent margin of error. The Pew report was based on a bilingual telephone survey of 1,507 Latino adults, including 804 registered voters, from Aug. 23 through Sept. 21.  In July 2008, four months before the presidential election that year, 94 percent of respondents said they planned to vote. According to previous Pew research, about 81.7 percent of Hispanic registered voters cast ballots in 2012, the year  Democratic President Barack Obama ran successfully against Republican Mitt Romney. That turnout was down from 84 percent in 2008, when Obama ran against Republican John McCain and won. The latest Pew survey found that Democrats continued to maintain an edge as the party more concerned for Latinos.  Hillary Clinton is relying on a coalition of minority voters to help her against Trump, who launched his presidential bid last year by calling some Mexican immigrants rapists and promising to build a wall to stop them entering the United States. Latinos, a growing segment of the U.S. electorate with rising influence in closely fought states like Florida and Nevada, tend to lean Democratic and favor Clinton heavily over Trump. According to the survey, some 58 percent support Clinton compared to 19 percent for Trump. Another 10 percent favor Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and 6 percent prefer Green candidate Jill Stein.  Turnout among Latinos tends to run well below that of whites and African Americans, blunting their impact in political races.  A number of civic groups opposed to Trump have been working to ensure Latinos get to the polls.  Pew said that 27.3 million Latinos were eligible to vote. However, knowing how many of those people are registered is harder to measure because many states do not capture information such as race or ethnicity along with voter registration information.  In 2012 an estimated 11.2 million Latinos voted in the presidential election, according to Pew. In 2008 that figure was 9.7 million Latino voters. While one must be a U.S. citizen to cast a ballot in U.S.  elections, requirements for voter registration can vary by state.  Immigrants rights group Americas Voice, for example, launched a new Spanish language radio ad in Miami and Orlando for the next two weeks bashing Trumps hardline immigration proposals, which include deporting all undocumented foreigners and making it harder for would-be immigrants to get visas. In Nevada, the Culinary Union, which is heavily Latino, is working to ensure its members get to the polls, helping them with logistics like finding their polling stations and arranging transport. It could make the difference between a one point loss and a one point win, said Yvanna Cancela, the unions political director. Sergio Garcia-Rios, a professor of Latino studies at Cornell University, said Clinton could be missing an opportunity to drive voter turnout further by not engaging Latino voters enough on policy. We cant just rely on an anger reaction to Donald Trump, he said. The challenge is to create enthusiasm for Latinos to get out and vote.   ",politicsNews,"October 11, 2016 ",1
Adviser rules out Trump meeting North Korea's Kim in near future,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An adviser to Donald Trump said on Tuesday he could not foresee any circumstances in the short or medium term in which the Republican presidential nominee would meet the leader of North Korea if he became president. The remark appeared to take a step back from Trumps position in May, when he told Reuters he was willing to talk to Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyangs nuclear program. Peter Hoekstra, a former Republican congressman and now an adviser to Trump, was asked at a debate on U.S. policy towards North Korea under what conditions Trump would meet Kim. I cant imagine any set of circumstances, in the short or intermediate future, that would see President Trump in a summit meeting with the leader of North Korea, he said. Hoekstra avoided directly repeating suggestions by Trump that U.S. allies Japan and South Korea could be allowed to develop nuclear weapons to defend themselves against North Korea, rather than relying on the U.S. nuclear umbrella. That will be decided once South Korea, Japan the United States identify what their objectives are going to be vis--vis North Korea and the tactics they are going to put in place to address that objective, he said, when asked to clarify where Trump stood on the issue. However, Hoekstra added that it would be stated very, very clearly, as we go into those discussions with South Korea and Japan, that everythings on the table. Former Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Kurt Campbell, a supporter of Trumps rival Hillary Clinton, said: The real issue here is, Is this strategically wise? According to Campbell, Trump had said maybe in the heat of the campaign ... things that have been deeply unnerving to Asia. Hoekstra said Trump was not seeking to challenge U.S. friendships in Asia, but it was necessary to sit down with allies to develop a successful North Korea strategy. Asked about Trumps complaints that Asian allies were freeloading on the United States, he said Trumps business background meant some of his statements came out a little bit more coarse than some of us in the political world might be comfortable with. But allies would be expected to pay their fair share as U.S. taxpayers could not subsidize the defense of others, he said. Asked if their candidates considered preemptive strikes a conceivable means of dealing with North Koreas nuclear program, both Campbell and Hoekstra said no options were off the table.

"Chicago mayor seeks rebound with new budget, labor peace","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel moved this week to bolster his sagging political fortunes, delivering within a few hours both a labor pact with the citys teachers and a no-drama 2017 city budget devoid of any big tax hikes. On Tuesday morning, Emanuel unveiled a $9.8 billion city spending plan for fiscal 2017 that includes $3.7 billion for operations, relying on $82.3 million in revenue growth, savings from efficiencies and a few one-time measures. Since winning re-election last year, the Democratic mayor has been dealing with racially charged fallout from the 2014 police shooting of a black teenager and the pension-driven financial hardships facing the city and its school system. It is a budget free of an immediate pension crisis, free of the black cloud of insolvency threatening the retirements of city employees and the financial future of Chicago, Emanuel told the city council. Twelve hours earlier, he signed off on a four-year tentative contract deal with teachers in the countrys third-largest public school system to avert what would have been a third strike in four years. The pact, which still must be ratified by the Chicago Teachers Union, relies on a bigger injection of surplus revenue he controls from the citys development districts. To be sure, the spate of good news for Emanuel does not mean the mayor is free of political trouble. In 2016, Emanuel reeled from the effects of street protests stemming from the death of unarmed, 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, whom a white police officer shot 16 times. Emanuels administration kept a police video of the killing under wraps while he ran for re-election last year. More broadly, street violence in Chicago continues unabated, leaving the city with more murders this year than New York City and Los Angeles combined. The city budget Emanuel outlined accommodates the initial phase of a two-year plan to add 970 police positions to address the citys sharp spike in violence. Until we see the focus on crime in the city and the policing issue from the mayor in more ways than we saw this summer, which was not a lot of focus until it was absolutely necessary, thats one of the biggest issues in the city, said Alderman Scott Waguespack, an Emanuel critic and member of the city councils progressive bloc. Financially, the city has faced a series of credit rating downgrades due to an unfunded pension liability that Moodys Investors Service has said is the highest among U.S. municipalities it rates. That liability stood at $33.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2015 for Chicagos four retirement systems.  The mayor last year pushed through a $543 million phased-in property tax increase for police and firefighter retirement systems. The city enacted a new tax on water and sewer usage last month to rescue its largest pension fund for municipal workers from insolvency. A Chicago-based government finance watchdog group welcomed Emanuels budget blueprint on Tuesday. Generally, our initial reaction to the mayors plan is this is a good-news budget for the city of Chicago, said Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation. Emanuels top city council ally, Alderman Patrick OConnor, said the mayor is making solid progress in digging Chicago out of its fiscal and social mess. But no one is saying it yet amounts to a platform for a possible third term in 2019, which the mayor has not yet ruled out. There are ebbs and flows to popularity. There are ebbs and flows to crisis, OConnor said. Who knows what the crisis of the day is going to be a year from now or two years from now? ",politicsNews,"October 11, 2016 ",1

Trump tax plan would aid Wall St. despite closing loophole,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reiterated his promise in Sundays debate to kill the carried interest tax loophole that benefits hedge fund managers and others - but his tax plan offers other goodies for Wall Street, a nonpartisan tax research group said on Tuesday. Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clintons tax plans differ like mirror images, especially when it comes to how they treat investment fund managers and other wealthy Americans, according to separate reports by the Tax Policy Center. Trumps tax plan would reduce federal tax revenues by $6.2 trillion over a decade, with about three-quarters of the decrease coming from lower business taxes, the center said. Those with incomes in the top 0.1 percent would see an average tax cut of nearly $1.1 million.  Clinton would raise revenue by $1.4 trillion almost entirely through higher taxes on the wealthy, including a 4 percent surcharge on those with incomes of more than $5 million. The Clinton campaign said the analysis showed she would require the wealthy, Wall Street and large corporations to pay their fair share.      The Trump campaign denounced it as a fraudulent analysis plagued by software problems. The Wall Street carried interest loophole allows financial managers at private equity, hedge fund and other qualifying firms to pay a capital gains tax rate on their income instead of the higher income tax rate. Clinton would close the loophole with no compensating benefits for those hit, the center said. Under Trumps proposal, the center said hedge funds and private equity partnerships would qualify for a special 15 percent business tax rate, depending on their size, the center said. That would be well below Trumps proposed top income tax rate of 33 percent and less than the 23.8 percent rate that funds now pay under carried interest rules. Literally, he is getting rid of carried interest, said Eric Toder, co-director of the center, which is a collaboration of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. The question is what else is there in the plan that affects hedge funds, and the reduction in the business income tax rate to 15 percent gives them a much better deal, Toder said. Large investment fund managers would lose any advantage because the Trump plan would subject them to an additional 20 percent dividend tax, the center said. Analysts said Trump had not said what constitutes a large business. Our plan has explicit safeguards to keep hedge funds from abusing the business rate - its Hillary who plans secret benefits for Wall Street, not us, Trump national policy director Stephen Miller said in a statement.

U.S. justices to weigh detainee suit against Bush officials,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to decide whether to block a lawsuit against former Attorney General John Ashcroft and others by non-U.S. citizens, mainly Muslims, swept up after the Sept. 11 attacks who said they were abused in detention. The senior officials under former President George W. Bush, also including former FBI Director Robert Mueller and Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner James Ziglar, have asked the justices to reverse a 2015 lower court ruling allowing the long-running suit to proceed. The civil rights lawsuit seeks to hold the former officials responsible for racial and religious profiling and abuse in detention that the plaintiffs said they endured after being detained following the 2001 attacks by al Qaeda Islamic militants on the United States. The brief order said two justices, liberals Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, will not participate, meaning only six justices will hear the case. The court remains one justice short following Antonin Scalias February death. The suit was filed by a group of Muslim, Arab and South Asian non-U.S. citizens who, their lawyers said, were held as terrorism suspects based on their race, religion, ethnicity and immigration status and abused in detention before being deported. They were charged only with civil immigration violations. But the plaintiffs said they were subjected at Brooklyns Metropolitan Detention Center to 23-hours-a-day solitary confinement, strip searches, sleep deprivation, beatings and other abuses and denied the ability to practice their religion. They said their rights under the U.S. Constitution to due process and equal protection under the law were violated. The plaintiffs include Benamar Benatta, an Algerian Muslim who was seeking refugee status in Canada, and Ahmed Khalifa, an Egyptian Muslim who said he was on vacation. During the U.S. Justice Departments massive investigation after the 2001 attacks, certain immigrants in the country illegally were detained until being cleared of Sept. 11 involvement. The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Ashcroft, Mueller and Ziglar could be sued, based on a 1971 Supreme Court ruling. In 2013, a judge had dismissed the claims against them but allowed some against detention facility wardens. Ashcroft and Mueller are represented by the Justice Department, which asked the justices to hear the appeal. Government lawyers say there is no proof Ashcroft or Mueller personally condoned any potential unconstitutional actions. The court will hear arguments and rule by the end of June. In a similar previous case, the Supreme Court in 2009 backed Ashcroft, saying a lawsuit by detainees failed to contain specific details on Ashcrofts involvement. ",politicsNews,"October 11, 2016 ",1

Obama says work has begun on habitats to help humans reach Mars,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama, highlighting his pledge to send people to Mars by the 2030s, on Tuesday announced further public-private efforts to build habitats that could help humans live long-term far from the Earth. We are working with our commercial partners to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space. These missions will teach us how humans can live far from Earth - something well need for the long journey to Mars, Obama said in an opinion piece on CNNs website. His comments come ahead of a meeting planned by the White House in Pittsburgh this week to team up scientists, students and others to advance the commercial space market, Obama said.  NASA separately said it was coordinating with commercial space companies to develop deep space habitat modules and create opportunities for companies to use the International Space Stations docking port. Obama has previously sought to boost space exploration and renewed that pledge on Tuesday: We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of Americas story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time.  The two-term presidents recommitment comes in the final months of his tenure and faces an uncertain future after he leaves office in January. His successors will be chosen on Nov. 8 in an election that could also reshape Congress, which allocates government funding.     Obama, a self-described nerd who last year hosted budding astronomers at the White House, has made known his love of space. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her rival, Republican Donald Trump, have given little, if any, attention to the issue on the campaign trail. Humans have yet to travel to Mars, Earths neighbor some 35 million miles (56 million km) away. Like Earth, the so-called Red Planet also has seasons, and a 2012 National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) mission found conditions there once supported microbial life, according to the U.S. space agency. It would take about eight months to get there, depending on rocket velocity, according to NASA experts.  Efforts to fund the space program have faltered in recent years over concerns about fiscal priorities. As part of the space habitat effort, NASA said on Tuesday it was entering the so-called proving ground stage to demonstrate and test various technologies over the next 10 years.

U.S. Supreme Court turns away companies in California tax dispute,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a challenge by Procter & Gamble Co and other companies to the way California imposes taxes on businesses that operate in multiple states. The justices left in place a December 2015 ruling by the California Supreme Court that California is not bound by a 1967 agreement between states that set a formula for calculating taxes. California, which joined the Multistate Tax Compact in 1974, changed the formula in 1993. California has since withdrawn from the state compact. Several companies, including two Procter & Gamble subsidiaries, Kimberly-Clark Worldwide Inc and Merck KGaA subsidiary Sigma-Aldrich Corp, sued in 2010 after being denied refunds for the tax they paid between 1993 and 2005. The companies said they overpaid their taxes by $34 million. Lawyers for the companies had said $750 million in potential tax refunds in California and additional amounts in other states were at stake in the case. Many states have moved away from the Multistate Tax Compact formula. To favor and attract businesses within their borders, these states have rearranged the way they tax business income so that in-state businesses pay less and out-of-state businesses pay more.

Father of U.S. war hero attacks Trump's comment at debate,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Khizr Khan, the father of a decorated American soldier killed in Iraq, lashed out at Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday for saying his son would still be alive if Trump had been president at the time. For this candidate to put his political expediency ahead of any realization of pain and suffering of the families is shameful, Khan said in an interview with CNN. The New York businessman raised the name of U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan in a Sunday night presidential debate while  criticizing Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for voting in favor of the 2003 invasion of Iraq when she was a U.S. senator. If I was president at that time he would be alive today, Trump said. Despite his assertion that he always opposed the war, Trump had expressed support for it in a 2002 interview. Khizr Khan had delivered a speech to the Democratic National Convention in July showcasing his sons military service and criticizing Trumps campaign call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. Trump responded at the time by questioning whether Khans wife, Ghazala Khan, was not allowed to speak when she appeared next to her husband on the stage, an insinuation of some conservative form of Islam that embroiled the candidate in an unpopular dispute with the Muslim parents of a fallen war hero.  The Khans were stunned to hear Trump bring up the name of their son, who was killed in 2004, in Sundays nationally televised debate, the father said. We were not only shocked, we were saddened for such disingenuous expression of his thinking and of his feeling, Khan said. Trump has said he has modified his call for a ban on Muslims entering the country to a plan for extreme vetting. ",politicsNews,"October 11, 2016 ",1
"U.S. must stop judicial 'extortion' of corporate Europe, French lawmakers say","PARIS (Reuters) - Europe should challenge the United States over its increasingly aggressive use of extraterritorial laws that have cost European companies - especially banks - billions in fines and other settlements, a French parliamentary report said. Still reeling from the $9 billion fine its biggest bank, BNP Paribas, had to pay U.S. authorities over violations of American sanctions against other countries, the French government has criticized in recent years what it considers the over-reach of the U.S. legal system. Pariss main objections center on the U.S. Department of Justices broad interpretation of what it considers its jurisdiction. This sphere of influence can include transactions between non-Americans outside the U.S. where the U.S. dollar currency is involved. It can also cover deals and other actions taking place via the Internet using U.S. computer servers. We consider that todays situation amounts to abusive use of American law, Karine Berger, a lawmaker from the ruling Socialist party told Reuters in an interview, calling the practices akin to extortion. We ask France and Europe to let it be known to the United States that we will no longer accept this type of behavior. In a non-binding investigative report last week, lawmakers from both the Socialist party and opposition conservatives said U.S. law appeared to be more punitive toward foreign firms than domestic ones. Although foreign firms accounted for only 30 percent of investigations opened by U.S. authorities between 1977 and 2014 under its anti-foreign bribery law, 67 percent of the amount levied in fines came from foreign companies, the report said. Since 2009, European banks such as HSBC and Deutsche Bank have paid about $16 billion to the United States over breaches of various sanction regimes. European firms have also accounted for 14 of the 15 biggest penalties, the report said. The report did not question U.S. regulators current prosecution of Deutsche Bank over mis-selling toxic mortgage securities before the financial crisis, since the actions took place in the United States. But it did say the DoJ had not taken account of the impact on the financial system that the $14 billion fine it sought from the German bank went on to have. Swiss bank Credit Suisse said on Sunday it has put five employees on leave while it investigates a tax-related matter. Swiss paper SonntagsZeitung reported that the move was connected to a U.S. probe of the banks Israeli unit over possible tax evasion. Berger said Europes response had not been forceful enough, and that both the European Union and individual member states should adapt their own legislation, which is why the report will be sent to counterparts at other EU parliaments. There must be a legal rearmament in Europe, so we fight on equal terms with the United States in the field of economic competition, Berger said.   The European Union should consider challenging parts of the U.S. sanction regime at the World Trade Organisation, the report said, citing a 1998 precedent when Europeans successfully forced the U.S. to back down over Congressional sanctions against Cuba, Libya and Iran that could have affected European firms. The EU should update a 1996 ban on European firms complying with U.S. sanctions based on such extraterritorial legislation, giving European firms a legal excuse to reject U.S. demands. European countries and institutions should also encourage the use of the euro for global transactions and strengthen the use of intelligence services for economic means. Citing the recent EU ruling asking Apple to pay up to 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland, Berger said Europe should not be afraid to be more confrontational. It shows Europe is perfectly capable of waging this economic war since the U.S. is only going to keep it up, she said. ",politicsNews,"October 11, 2016 ",1
A new worry for Clinton: Trump's struggles may depress Democratic voter turnout,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clintons campaign is confronting an emerging risk to her presidential ambitions - if Donald Trump continues to trail her in opinion polls many Democrats may simply stay at home on Election Day. Without enough popular support, Clinton would enter the White House lacking the political capital she would need to drive through her agenda. In the worst-case scenario it could cost her the presidency if Republicans turn out in big numbers on Nov. 8.      Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has spent much of her campaign sounding the alarm over the prospect of a President Trump. She has struggled to lay out a compelling vision for her presidency and has failed to excite key constituencies, including millennials, minority voters and liberal Democrats. Opinion polls show that many voters are backing Clinton primarily to stop Trump, the Republican nominee, from getting into the White House. If they believe he has no hope of winning, then what would their motivation be to turn up at the polls?  In a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll about half of all Clinton supporters said they were backing her to keep Trump from winning. By contrast, just 36.5 percent said it was because of Clintons policies and just 12.6 percent said it was because they like her personally.  Turnout is correlated with levels of competition, said Michael McDonald, an elections expert at the University of Florida. The higher the competition, the higher the turnout. The young Americans, blacks, Latinos, and low-income voters who make up much of the Democratic base often need to feel motivated by a particular candidate or issue to turn out, McDonald said, as was the case with President Barack Obamas candidacy in 2008.  Clintons campaign has long worried about voter complacency and has at every turn pushed the notion that the race is close and that Trump is unfit to be president. With her lead growing, that task grows more difficult. A Reuters/Ipsos 50-state survey (carried out before Fridays release of a video tape in which Trump makes vulgar remarks about women) gave the Democratic nominee a 95 percent chance of winning the election. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll on Monday showed Clinton with an 11-point lead nationally over Trump. Low Democratic voter turnout could leave Trump an opening in swing states. And should Clinton win the election, a slim margin of victory could compound the challenge she will face in trying to govern a deeply divided nation.  Clintons campaign, however, will be able to rely on an extensive and well-funded voter mobilization effort, one that is expected to give her an edge over Trumps smaller organization.  The Clinton campaign insisted on Monday the race will remain tight. It sent out a new fundraising pitch to supporters, contending that Trump is an authoritarian threat for saying at Sundays presidential debate that she would be in jail if he was president.  Clinton must also contend with anger among liberal Democrats over leaked excerpts of paid speeches she made to banks and big business. The excerpts appeared to confirm their fears about her support for global trade and tendency to cozy up to Wall Street. Some liberals have also been waiting for Clinton to make a more positive case for her own presidency. This election cannot be just a referendum on Donald Trump, said Arun Chaudhury, creative director of Revolution Messaging, a left-leaning consulting firm that oversaw the online media operation of former Clinton rival, Senator Bernie Sanders.  Clintons central message, he said, has been that everyone has to step up and stop Donald Trump from being president, not step up and make Hillary Clinton president.  The best campaign messages are comparative in nature, said Ben Turchin, a Democratic pollster who worked for Sanders campaign. She can win by a bigger margin by giving a little more of an affirmative case for her presidency. While Clinton frequently goes on the attack against Trump, calling him racist, sexist and dangerous, her campaign insists it has been trying to get a positive, policy-oriented message out. It is hard in this campaign when youre running against him and he generates so much controversy and therefore headlines, Jennifer Palmieri, Clintons communications director, told Reuters. Its hard to break through on any one day, and thats why we just have to keep at it. The two candidates central campaign slogans reflect their differing appeals to the electorate. Where Trumps is the change-oriented Make America Great Again, Clintons is a more stolid Stronger Together, which speaks to rallying existing Democratic voters around her candidacy - and is a harder sell.  Clintons campaign seems to have recognized the need for some adjustments to its message.  Since the presidential race intensified last month, Clinton has returned to the style of campaigning that helped her win early states in the Democratic nominating contests, holding smallish events focused on issues of most concern to core Democratic constituencies such as women and young voters.  Turchin, the former Sanders pollster, said Clintons efforts at fashioning a positive message were improving, although she is still having difficulty attracting the support of 18-to-34 year-old voters, among others.  Youve got to make the hard case over and over again, he said. Shes got to convince people she shares their values. ",politicsNews,"October 10, 2016 ",1
"TV audience sharply down for second Trump-Clinton debate, despite tape furor","NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The television audience for the second debate between White House contenders Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton fell sharply from their first, record-breaking encounter, despite the drama caused by a 2005 video of Trump boasting about groping women. Nielsen data for 11 broadcast, cable and public television channels on Monday showed that some 66.5 million Americans tuned into the bitter 90-minute debate on Sunday, well below the record 84 million that watched the first face-off two weeks ago. The figures do not include millions more who watched the debate online, through social media or in bars and restaurants. Second presidential debates tend to attract smaller TV audiences, but attention was high going into Sundays matchup after the emergence of the Trump video prompted several Republican politicians to abandon him.  However, the second debate took place in the same time slot as NBCs popular Sunday Night Football, which was watched by about 15 million Americans, Nielsen data showed. NBC did not carry the debate. While the National Football League game, along with Major League Baseball play-offs, likely pulled viewers away from the debate, many Americans already may have made up their minds on candidates, said Tom Hollihan, communication professor at the University of Southern Californias Annenberg School. When we get to mid-October, history tells us people have already made their decisions, he said. They lock themselves into their viewpoints and are less open to new information. The furor over the Trump tape and his attacks on Hillary Clintons husband, former President Bill Clinton, for alleged sexual misconduct also may have turned off some viewers. Sundays debate, the second of three before the Nov. 8 election, was remarkable for the brutal nature of the exchanges between Trump and Clinton, his Democratic rival.   While in the past families might have made a commitment to watch a presidential debate, I think many in this case were saying, Why should I do that? Why should I have to answer my kids questions about these topics? Hollihan said. The TV audience ranked below the nations top 10 most-watched presidential encounters, and below that for President Barack Obamas first and second 2012 debates with Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Last weeks vice presidential debate between Republican Mike Pence and Democrat Tim Kaine drew 37 million Americans - the lowest audience for a VP debate since 2000.

Top Republican Ryan distances himself from Trump White House bid,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Ryan, the top Republican in the U.S. Congress, took the extraordinary step on Monday of distancing himself from Donald Trump, stirring a backlash from some lawmakers and deepening a crisis over his partys struggling presidential nominee.         In a conference call with congressional Republicans, Ryan all but conceded that Democrat Hillary Clinton was likely to win the White House on Nov. 8 and said he would put his full energy into preserving Republican majorities in Congress so as not to give her a blank check.             Ryan, the speaker of the House of Representatives, said he would not defend Trump or campaign for him after the uproar over the New York businessmans sexually aggressive comments that surfaced on Friday.     Ryans announcement added to the partys worst turmoil in decades and reinforced the growing sense of isolation around  Trump, who has never previously run for public office. Clinton has led Trump in most national opinion polls for months and Trumps poll numbers have begun to drop further since the emergence on Friday of a video from 2005 showing the former reality TV star bragging crudely about groping women and making unwanted sexual advances.   Trump hit back at Ryan, the Republican vice presidential candidate in 2012, who has frequently been critical of him.     Paul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee, Trump wrote on Twitter.  Ryan, who had expressed disgust over the tape and canceled a campaign event with Trump over the weekend, did not completely cut ties to Trump. The speaker went back on the Republican conference call later to clarify he was not withdrawing his endorsement. Many Republican members of Congress are concerned that Trumps chaotic campaign could ruin their chances of holding their majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in the November election and could inflict long-term damage on the party.  During a weekend dominated by criticism of Trump over the lewd remarks, a string of members of Congress, governors and other prominent Republicans called on him to drop out of the race. House Republicans gave Ryan a rough ride on the call, according to some participants. There was an undeniable opposition to the speakers tepid support of our nominee, said U.S. Representative Scott DesJarlais, a Trump supporter, in a comment passed on by an aide.  Many other lawmakers, some of whom did not want to be named publicly criticizing the speaker, said members frequently told Ryan on the call to stand by Trump. Nonetheless, nearly half of all 331 incumbent Republican senators, Congress members and governors have condemned Trumps remarks, and roughly one in 10 has called on him to drop out of the race, according to a Reuters review of official statements and local news coverage. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus used an afternoon conference call with RNC members to emphasize there was no rift with Trump and that the committee, the partys leadership and fundraising arm, still backed the nominee, two RNC members who spoke on condition of anonymity said. Any suggestion that the RNC isnt fully supporting the Trump-Pence ticket is wrong, one RNC member said, describing the message. We are fully on board. We are going to devote every ounce of effort and resource into helping the Trump-Pence ticket win and all the other candidates up and down the ballot. Any attempt to replace Trump on the ballot this close to Election Day would face huge legal and logistical hurdles. A defiant Trump went on the offensive in a vicious presidential debate on Sunday, saying Clinton, a former secretary of state would go to jail if he were president and attacking her husband, former President Bill Clinton, for his treatment of women. The debate, the second of three before the vote, was remarkable for the brutal nature of the exchanges between the two. Trump stayed on the attack on Monday, describing Bill Clinton as a predator and saying: If they want to release more tapes saying inappropriate things, well continue to talk about Bill and Hillary Clinton doing inappropriate things. There are so many of them. She goes out and says: I love women, Im going to help women. Shes a total hypocrite, he told supporters in Ambridge, Pennsylvania. Clinton accused Trump of brushing off criticism of his comments about women.  On Friday, the whole world heard him talking about the terrible way he treats women. And last night when he was pressed about how he behaves, he just doubled down on his excuse that its just locker room banter, she told a rally at Wayne State University in Detroit.  The television audience for the debate fell sharply from their first, record-breaking encounter in September.     Nielsen data supplied by CNN for 10 broadcast and cable channels on Monday showed that 63.6 million Americans tuned into the 90-minute debate on Sunday, well below the record 84 million that watched the first face-off.     An NBC News/Wall Street Journal opinion poll released on Monday showed Clinton increasing her lead. The survey, conducted after the video release but before the debate, showed Clinton with 46 percent support among likely voters in a four-way matchup including two minor party candidates, compared with 35 percent for Trump.     The Reuters/Ipsos State of the Nation project released on Monday estimated that Clinton had at least a 95 percent chance of winning the 270 Electoral College votes needed to become president. The polling did not capture reaction to Trumps performance in Sundays debate or the release of the Friday videotape. ",politicsNews,"October 10, 2016 ",1
Locker room talk? Key women voters call foul on Trump's defense,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Donald Trump has dismissed his vulgar sexual comments about women that surfaced on a video as locker room talk, but his explanation did little to soothe the queasiness of Esther Rosser, a 71-year-old grandmother from Virginia. I know he apologized, and all you can do is apologize, but he could have said more, said Rosser, who has voted Republican her whole life but decided this weekend that she would support Trumps rival for president, Democrat Hillary Clinton. He disrespected us, she said of Trump, referring to women in general. Rossers misgivings echoed many of the sentiments expressed by more than two dozen women voters interviewed by Reuters who, as recently as September, had not decided whether they would support Trump or Clinton in the Nov. 8 U.S. election. In the informal survey conducted by phone the day after Sundays presidential debate, many women said they were appalled by the 2005 video in which Trump bragged of kissing and groping women without consent. The video surfaced on the Washington Posts website on Friday afternoon.  Several of the voters also said they disliked the Republican presidential candidates strategy of highlighting the infidelities of Hillary Clintons husband, Bill Clinton, in an effort to defend his own conduct, or shift attention away from it. I didnt like the fact that he was attacking Hillary on things her husband did, said Connie Sasso, a 66-year-old retiree from Missouri. Its wrong - its just wrong. In the second presidential debate with Clinton on Sunday in St. Louis, Missouri, Trump said he was embarrassed by the video but dismissed his comments as locker room talk. He also accused Hillary Clinton of attacking women who had alleged sexual misconduct by her husband, who was president from 1993 to 2001. Trumps criticism of Bill Clintons infidelities drew applause from supporters at a Monday rally he held in Pennsylvania. But Trump, whose core voters are overwhelmingly male, has struggled to appeal to women, who made up 53 percent of the U.S. electorate in the 2012 election. If Trump is unable to narrow the gender gap, he will be unable to overcome Clintons lead in the polls. I cant with good conscience vote for someone with that kind of mindset to the presidency, said LeighAnn Chase, a 27-year-old nursing student from Lakeland, Florida.  As a woman, she was floored by Trumps comments, and disgusted that others would seek to justify them, said Chase, a registered Republican who said she is now backing Clinton. Patsy Bennewise, 58, of North Little Rock, Arkansas, never voted for Clintons husband during the nearly 10 years he was her states governor. But her streak of never voting for a Clinton is set to end in November when she said she will cast her ballot for the Democratic candidate. She said of Trump: Hes turned the presidential election into a mockery. Not all undecided women voters contacted by Reuters came out against Trump. Amy Fryzelka, a 37-year-old tutor from Kansas City, Missouri, said she thought Trumps comments were horrible but she believed his personal life would not influence how he would govern. She said she is leaning toward the Republican candidate because she believes Clinton is too deceptive. Id prefer not to vote for either of them, really, Fryzelka said. Jane Simmons, 78, of Sterling Heights, Michigan, also said she would rather not vote for either Clinton or Trump. Simmons, whose mail-in ballot arrived on Friday, hours before she and other Americans learned of Trumps lewd comments, said the video led her to consider backing Clinton.  This is an indication of what the man is, although it was a decade ago, I dont think he changed very much, she said. I dont believe hes got a conscience. For Rosser, the Virginia grandmother, the decision to cast her vote for Clinton came when her 14-year-old granddaughter asked her to explain why Trump would say the things he said in the video. Hes not a good role model for kids, she said.  ",politicsNews,"October 11, 2016 ",1
"Clinton weighed reinstating Glass-Steagall, Wikileaks emails show","(Reuters) - A longtime political adviser to Hillary Clinton last year urged her presidential campaign to support a new version of a law that separated commercial and investment banking to avoid antagonizing the Democratic Partys progressive wing, according to emails published by Wikileaks on Monday. Mandy Grunwald, an outside adviser to Clinton, urged Clintons policy team in October 2015, just days before a Wall Street policy rollout, to consider endorsing a new version of the Glass-Steagall Act, according to an email reviewed by Reuters. The Glass-Steagall Act was a Depression-era law that prohibited commercial banks from engaging in risky trading activities. The 1933 law was repealed in 1999 during the presidency of Bill Clinton when he passed legislation removing barriers between commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies. Many Democratic activists believe that reinstating the Glass-Steagall law and breaking up large financial institutions would help prevent future financial crises such as the one that rocked the U.S. economy in 2008.  Grunwald said if Clinton did not back a new Glass-Steagall, she risked alienating liberal U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, an outspoken critic of Wall Street who is popular in the left wing of the Democratic Party. The Clinton campaign would neither confirm nor deny the authenticity of the latest batch of hacked emails of Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta released by Wikileaks. The U.S. government last week formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations, a charge Russia has denied. As a result, Clinton campaign officials and supporters have warned that such email releases could include fraudulent or misleading documents among genuine emails. At the time of Grunwalds email, Clintons primary debates against her then-rival U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont were fast approaching. Grunwald worried that if Clinton did not support a new Glass-Steagall law,it would make it more difficult to defend her plan to curb Wall Street risk. It could also prompt Warren to endorse Sanders, Grunwald wrote in the email released by Wikileaks.  Grunwald said that in conversations with Clinton, the former secretary of state had indicated she was leaning toward endorsing Glass Steagall, instead of or in addition to the risk-based approach she ultimately announced. I understand we face phoniness charges if we change our position now - but we face risks this way too, Grunwald wrote, adding that Clintons policy team told her it should be a political decision. In the weeks after the email, Clinton announced that she would look to break up large banks based on the risk they posed to the economy, not based on size alone or type of investment activity. Clinton also proposed levying a risk fee on the liabilities of banks with more than $50 billion in assets, saying it was a more comprehensive approach. Democratic Party sources told Reuters on Monday they believe that around 50,000 of Podestas emails are in the possession of Wikileaks and they expect them to be dribbled out periodically between now and the Nov. 8 election between Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. A previous dump of hacked emails from Podesta on Friday included what appear to be excerpts from paid speeches that Clinton made to Wall Street, which her campaign had refused to release.

U.S. House Speaker Ryan to focus on protecting Republican congressional majorities: spokeswoman,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump on Monday suffered another political setback when U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan distanced himself from the Republican presidential candidates troubled campaign. Ryan, according to someone familiar with a conference call held by the speaker and House Republican lawmakers, will not campaign with Trump in the run-up to the Nov. 8 elections and will not defend the Republican Party nominee. The source did not say whether Ryan intended to withdraw his support for Trump. But a spokeswoman added that the Wisconsin congressman will focus on maintaining a Republican majority in the House.

Trump in crisis after lewd remarks about women come to light,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump plunged into a deep crisis on Friday after a bombshell 2005 recording came to light in which he boasted in vulgar terms about trying to have sex with an unidentified married woman and groping women, saying when youre a star, they let you do it. A stream of Republican leaders denounced the remarks, first published by the Washington Post, which threaten Trumps already shaky standing with women voters just a month ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top Republican elected official, said he was sickened by the comments and said Trump would no longer attend a campaign event in Wisconsin with him on Saturday. I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests, Ryan said in a statement. Reince Preibus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the comments were repugnant and that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere. U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, who has been one of Clintons fiercest critics, said he had retracted his endorsement of Trump, telling CNN he would not be able to look his 15-year-old daughter in the eye if he voted for Trump. Utahs Republican Governor Gary Herbert said on Twitter he would also no longer vote for Trump. Tonight, millions of Republicans are facing a moment of truth, Herbert said. Republican lawmaker Mike Coffman from Colorado told CBS that Trump should step aside and said his defeat at this point seems almost certain. Trump was expected to release a video statement late on Friday. Earlier, in a brief written statement, Trump shrugged off the leaked tape as locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago. In the recorded conversation, Trump was wearing a microphone and chatting on a bus with Billy Bush, then host of NBCs Access Hollywood ahead of a segment they were about to tape. I did try and fuck her. She was married, Trump said. I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldnt get there. Trump talked about his attraction to beautiful women. I just start kissing them, he said. And when youre a star they let you do it, he said. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything. Trump, who has brought up former President Bill Clintons infidelities as a criticism of Hillary Clinton, calling her a total enabler, responded to the audio. Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course - not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended, Trump said. Access Hollywood confirmed the video in its own report, saying it discovered the comments in its library. Billy Bush said in a statement to Variety he was embarrassed and ashamed of his comments. Other prominent Republicans also condemned the comments but stopped short of withdrawing their support for their candidate, including Arizona Senator John McCain and Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Trump, known for his unconventional and controversial speaking style, has made a series of gaffes in his campaign, but the graphic nature of the clip will hurt his standing among women, independents, and wavering Republicans, said David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University. Weve never seen something like this Trump clip in a modern presidential campaign, Yepsen said, calling the incident sad for the American political system and for Trumps supporters. Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said this feels like it is quickly becoming a political game over for Trump. Unless voters dont care about these issues or believe that this is simply political dirty tricks by releasing the videos now, Trump is going to have to pull a rabbit out of his hat in order to turn things around, Bonjean said. Still, Trumps past controversial comments have failed to shake his core supporters, said David Axelrod, a former political adviser to Democratic President Barack Obama. Appalling as the (Trump) tape is, Im reminded of all the times we have said, THIS time hes REALLY done, Axelrod said on Twitter. The revelation comes right before Sundays town hall-style debate, seen as critical as Trump tries to rebound from a dip in some opinion polls after a rocky performance in the first debate. Clinton, who slammed Trumps comments as horrific, was also hit by a leak on Friday. Wikileaks published what appeared to be excerpts of her paid speeches to corporations, the transcripts of which the campaign has refused to release. The excerpts were likely to provide Trump some fodder for attacking Clinton in the debate. In them, she voices support for open trade and borders and discusses taking different positions in public and in private. However, Yepsen said the excerpts would likely be eclipsed by Trumps clip. The two things arent comparable, he said. The U.S. government formally accused Russia on Friday of hacking Democratic Party organizations ahead of the presidential election. Wikileaks has declined to name its sources. A spokesman for the Clinton campaign declined to confirm whether the Wikileaks emails were authentic and noted that other hacked documents have been faked.

Buffett hits back at Trump over tax comments,"(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett denied on Monday an allegation by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that he, like Trump, had taken a massive deduction that allowed him to avoid federal income taxes. Buffett said he paid about $1.85 million in income tax in 2015, and that returns for previous years were similar in respect to contributions, deductions and tax rates. Buffett said he was being audited by the Internal Revenue Service, but had no problem releasing his tax information. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, citing ongoing audits by the IRS. I have paid federal income tax every year since 1944, when I was 13, Buffett said in a statement, adding that being a slow starter, I owed only $7 in tax that year. Buffett, ranked the worlds third-richest person by Forbes magazine, said he had copies of all 72 of his returns and none uses a carryforward. Responding to an Oct. 1 New York Times story, Trump acknowledged during the presidential-candidates debate on Sunday that he had used investment losses to avoid paying taxes. Trump repeatedly said he was only taking advantage of tax provisions used by wealthy people who support Clinton. I absolutely used it, and so did Warren Buffett ..., he said. The Times reported that Trumps declared loss of $916 million in 1995 was so large that he could legally have avoided paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years. Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), said his 2015 tax return showed adjusted gross income of $11,563,931. My deductions totaled $5,477,694, of which allowable charitable contributions were $3,469,179. All but $36,037 of the remainder was for state income taxes, he said. The total charitable contributions I made during the year were $2,858,057,970, of which more than $2.85 billion were not taken as deductions and never will be. Tax law properly limits charitable deductions, Buffett said. Buffett said he had no problem releasing his tax information while under audit.  Neither would Mr Trump  at least he would have no legal problem.  ",politicsNews,"October 10, 2016 ",1
"As of last week, Clinton's White House chances 95 percent: Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation"," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Even before Sunday night'sviciouspresidential debate, Republican Donald Trump was losing ground in many of the states he needs to win to capture the presidency, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation Project analysisreleased on Monday.  The project estimates that if the election had been held at the end of last week, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had at least a 95 percent chance of winning enough states to reach the minimum 270 Electoral College votes needed to become the next president,based on polling between Sept. 30 and Oct. 7.  _________________________ STATES OF THE NATION What would it take for Donald Trump to turn the map red? _________________________ Those odds had steadily grown from about 60 percent on Sept. 15 to almost 90 percent on Sept 30. In the last four weeks, her estimated margin of victory has grown from about 14 votes to 118, according to the project.  The polling did not capture reaction to Trumps performance in Sundays debate or the release on Friday of his 11-year-old sexually aggressive comments about women.  The results, however, mirrored other estimates of her chances of winning the campaign.  Statistical analysis outfit FiveThirtyEight, for example, put Clintons chance of victory in the election at about 55 percent three weeks ago. Currently, they estimate the odds of a Clinton win at 82 percent. In the same period, the New York Times estimates of the odds of a Clinton victory have also increased, from about 70 percent to 84 percent.  Pennsylvania, Ohio, Nevada and Florida are now leaning toward the Democratic candidate, according to the Reuters/Ipsos project, an online survey of about 15,000 people every week. Arizona and Iowa are in the too-close-to-call category after being considered likely Trump states.  More broadly, the state-by-state results show how Trumps support is sliding. In the last week, he has lost ground in at least 21 states, including in seven of the 18 states where he is leading, while improving his position in 19 states.  Meanwhile, Clinton lost ground in 12 states, including in three of the 23 states where she is leading, and improved her standing in 30 sates.  Based on these results, Trumps best hope for a victory would require a precipitous drop in the number of Democratic voters going to the polls on Nov. 8 from expected levels, combined with a similarly large increase in Republican turnout.  LOCKER-ROOM TALK  Trumpscrude comments about groping women and aggressively pursuing a married woman, captured on an open microphone, have sent his campaign into turmoil.The recording, first reported by The Washington Post, was made in 2005, in advance of a cameo appearance on a soap opera.  Over the weekend, numerous Republican elected officials and candidates responded by calling for Trump to step aside.  Trump responded to his waning support among some Republicans by calling them hypocrites. During Sundays debate he apologized but said the comments were just locker-room talk.  He also attacked Bill Clintons treatment of women and said Hillary Clinton should be in jail for her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Trump said that, if elected, he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate her.  A nearly yearlong FBI investigation into the emails concluded earlier this year that no charges should be filed, although FBI Director James Comey said Clinton had been careless in her handling of sensitive material.  The sexually explicit comments controversy followed published reports suggesting the Republican Party leadership was having an internal debate about shifting resources away from the presidential race and into U.S. House and Senate races.  The Republicans currently control both branches of Congress. Many experts think control of the Senate could shift to the Democrats, although few are predicting the Republicans will lose control of the U.S. House of Representatives.  Even before the weekend, the Trump campaign had struggled through two weeks of negative news coverage that began with the campaigns first presidential debate on Sept. 26, which Reuters/Ipsos polling suggested Clinton had won.  Shortly after the first debate, the New York businessman also attacked  in tweets that began in the early hours of the morning  a former Miss Universe whom Clinton had referred to during the debate as an example of Trump degrading women.  Also during that period, a New York Times report detailed how Trump lost nearly $1 billion in 1995, a loss that could be used to avoid paying federal taxes for up to 18 years, depending on his annual income.  Clinton has had her share of woes as well, including the release of hacked emails last week of comments she appeared to have madeto banks and big business.In the 2014 comments, shepushes for open trade and open borders, and takes a conciliatory approach to Wall Street, both positions she later backed away from.",politicsNews,"October 10, 2016 ",1
"Trump may have stopped the bleeding, but not the worrying"," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump may have done just enough in Sundays presidential debate to keep his leaky presidential campaign afloat - and that may have put Republicans considering abandoning him in an even tougher position.  Had Trump imploded, the flow of lawmakers and party luminaries who deserted him at the weekend over lewd comments he made about women on a videotape likely would have become a torrent, increasing demands for him to drop out of the race.  But that didnt happen. Now, Republicans who have seen their party torn apart by Trumps candidacy are once again faced with a familiar dilemma: Publicly abandon a badly wounded candidate who is endangering closely contested congressional races or stand behind him in the dimming hope that he can still win them the White House.  The Manhattan real-estate mogul delivered a feistier and more disciplined performance than at the first debate, hammering his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton on her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, and again raising decades-old accusations of sexual misconduct against her husband Bill Clinton.  That likely endeared him to the rowdy supporters who have packed arenas across the country for more than a year while perhaps doing little to reel in the more moderate voters in swing states that his campaign will need to defeat Clinton in the Nov. 8 election.  His no-holds barred approach to Hillary tonight is what conservatives have wanted to see out of a candidate since Bill Clinton was in office, said Craig Robinson, former political director of the Iowa Republican Party. The Republican base and talk radio will love this performance.  But the party is still hitched to a deeply flawed candidate who has especially struggled with women, college-educated, and suburban voters. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed close to 20 percent of Americans were still undecided on which candidate to support. Sixty percent of those were women.  A poll taken by CNN immediately following the debate showed Republicans have reason to be anxious. Viewers said Clinton had beaten Trump in the encounter, 57 percent to 34 percent.  The furor over the 2005 videotape, in which Trump bragged about groping and trying to seduce women, led dozens of lawmakers to denounce him, including Arizona Senator John McCain. Their condemnation plunged the party into its worst crisis since the resignation of President Richard Nixon, a Republican, in 1974.  The House Republican Conference, a body comprised of the almost 250 Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives, was set to meet on Monday to discuss the foundering Trump campaign, a House leadership aide said. House Speaker Paul Ryan pointedly disinvited Trump for a joint appearance in Wisconsin that had been scheduled for Saturday following publication of the tape.  All but six of the 40 Republican officeholders whose races are considered competitive in the election have condemned Trumps comments in the video, although only three members of that group have called for him to drop out.  Since the release of the video, the partys governing body, the Republican National Committee, has offered no guidance to local party officials on how to handle questions about it.  There hasnt been one email or one phone call or anything as to what the guidance is from the RNC going forward, said an RNC official who asked to remain unidentified.  The tape intensified talk in Republican circles about diverting funds from Trump to prop up House and Senate candidates who might find themselves in newfound jeopardy because of the backlash.  Its well past time to cut all ties with Trump and focus on preserving the Republican Congress and down ballot offices. Immediately, said John Weaver, a veteran Republican strategist.  Republican officials have another worry: that Trumps unpopularity may lead many Republican voters to stay at home on Election Day.  Against this backdrop of panic and condemnation, Trump on Sunday sought to rally the partys base with a fresh barrage of provocative attacks on Clinton that will give the media something other than the tape to talk about.  He offered a blistering critique of her handling of foreign policy while the countrys chief diplomat and brought his rally cry for her to be jailed to the debate stage. He also carried out a threat to make an issue of her husbands sexual history.  In doing so, Trump may have stopped the bleeding, but he did nothing to stop the worrying.

Trump says he disagrees with his running mate on Syria,"ST. LOUIS (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump publicly broke with his running mate, Mike Pence, on how to deal with the civil war in Syria in comments during Sundays U.S. presidential debate that exposed further tensions within their campaign. He and I havent spoken, and I disagree, Trump said in response to a question from a moderator about comments by Pence that the United States should be ready to use force against Syrian military targets under the command of President Bashar al-Assad. I believe we have to get ISIS. We have to worry about ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee said in his debate with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, referring to Islamic State, the insurgent group fighting Assads forces. Pence in his debate last week with Clintons vice presidential running mate, Tim Kaine, appeared to break ranks with Trump, when he denounced Russian President Vladimir Putin for his interference in Syrias civil war and support for Assad. The small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States, Pence said.  Russian warplanes have been striking Islamic State positions in Syria in support of Assads government. Clinton has criticized Trump, who has praised Putin, as being too cozy with the Russian leader. After the debate on Sunday, Pence tweeted: Congrats to my running mate @realDonaldTrump on a big debate win! adding he was proud to stand with you. Trumps campaign is in crisis just a month before the Nov. 8 election after a flood of Republicans withdrew their support for the brash New York businessman and former reality TV star over a newly uncovered 2005 videotape in which he made sexually aggressive comments about women. In an unusual move, Pence issued a statement on Saturday critical of Trumps words on the tape, saying on Twitter that he cannot defend them. As a husband and father, I was offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump, the Indiana governor said. Before the debate on Sunday, however, a source close to Pence dismissed talk among some political analysts that he might bolt the ticket in the uproar over Trumps comments. Absolutely not, the source told Reuters. ",politicsNews,"October 10, 2016 ",1

The suspension comes as a flood of Republicans have withdrawn their support for Trump over the video that emerged on Friday showing the businessman, then a reality TV star, talking with Bush on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. In the recorded conversation, Trump was chatting on a bus with Bush, then host of NBCs Access Hollywood, ahead of a segment they were about to tape.

Noah Oppenheim, the executive in charge of the morning show, wrote in a memo to staff that there is simply no excuse for Billys language and behavior on that tape. Oppenheim said: NBC has decided to suspend Billy, pending further review of this matter.

Financial markets continue to price in Clinton win after debate,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stock index futures were little changed throughout Sundays highly contentious presidential debate, indicating that markets continue to view that Democrat Hillary Clinton holds an edge in the Nov. 8 election against her Republican rival, Donald Trump. The 90-minute debate got off to a chilly start when Clinton and Trump greeted each other without the traditional handshake.  It quickly turned into an acrimonious discussion of a 2005 video that emerged on Friday in which Trump was heard using vulgar language and talking about groping women without consent.  Investors said there was not enough in terms of policy substance in Sundays debate to change the markets perception of the direction of the race. I dont think it changed peoples opinions in the investing community that Clinton is more likely to win, as she was before the debate, certainly after Friday, said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. In a video released on Friday, Trump is heard talking on an open microphone in 2005 about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. The video was taped only months after Trump married his third wife, Melania.  There is still time to go and more things that could happen, but financial advisors are probably starting to feel they need to think about a Clinton win in terms of an investment thesis for 2017, Meckler said. He said such a thesis would likely include government intervention in healthcare, particularly medicine prices, and little support for coal as an energy source. S&P e-mini futures remained in a tight range throughout the debate, slightly higher than at the close on Friday. The market declared tonights debate a draw and has no more clue after debate than before, at least not in watching the S&P futures. Once again the debate was great theater, but did not give the market any insight, said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. Despite the nights civil ending, it was hard to glean much information, as a good part of the debate was simply a name-calling fest. Strategists in a recent Reuters equity poll mostly viewed an election victory on Nov. 8 by Clinton as more positive for the stock market through the end of the year, largely because her positions -unlike her opponents- are well known.           Steven Englander, global head of G10 currency strategy at CitiFX in New York, said: Both Trump and Clinton supporters expected that emerging market currencies and U.S. equities would go down and the VIX .VIX would go up if Trump were to win and vice versa if Clinton wins, he added. Trump has been critical of a U.S. trade deal with Mexico and Canada as well as other trade deals, and has promised to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it. The Mexican peso rose as much as 2 percent on Sunday and was last trading up 1.3 percent versus the greenback. S&P 500 e-minis ESc1, which were up 6 points shortly after opening three hours before the debate began, were up 5.25 points, or 0.24 percent. Its a positive reaction (in stocks), and its very consistent with what the market has been discounting, which is that Clinton will win and thats good news, said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany, New York, before the debate. Its also saying the House of Representatives will stay in the hands of the Republicans, he added. U.S. stocks briefly gained ground following a perceived win by Clinton in the first presidential debate last month. ",politicsNews,"October 10, 2016 ",1
"Asia investors, traders bet on Clinton win after bruising election debate","SYDNEY/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Investors and traders in Asia indicated on Monday they are mostly increasing their bets on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton winning the U.S. presidential race after the second of three debates with Republican party nominee Donald Trump.  Some, though remain cautious, saying there was still a chance of a surprise Trump win. They said many in the markets were wary after being burned by the shock Brexit vote in June. MSCIs broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up around 0.1 percent by mid-afternoon in Singapore on Monday, while Wall Street index futures were little changed after Clinton exchanged barbs with Republican party nominee Donald Trump in the televised event, which was shown live across trading rooms during Asias morning.  The 90-minute debate quickly turned into an acrimonious discussion of a 2005 video that emerged on Friday in which Trump was heard using vulgar language and talking about groping women.  The controversy has caused some senior Republicans to withdraw their support for him.  For those that think that Trump has a very, very low chance of winning the U.S. elections it might be a good time to go long on global equities, said Itay Tuchman, Citis head of markets for Australia and New Zealand. Markets could be prematurely pricing in a Clinton victory, as they did during the Brexit vote in June, when the United Kingdom voted unexpectedly to leave the European Union, said Lee Jin Yang, research analyst for Aberdeen Asset Management in Singapore. We need to remember that Brexit only became a key focus one week before the vote. The market had priced in near zero probability of it happening but it did.  According to a CNN online poll, Clinton won the debate by  57 percent to 34 percent. But Josh Crabb, head of Asian equities at Old Mutual Global Investors in Hong Kong, said he is wary of such polls - especially after Brexit.  The way that mainstream media, and a lot of commentators, interpret the outcome of the debate may be different to what the voting public in general takes away, Crabb said. That is a concern because often, a lot of these polls have not been quite as accurate as people are expecting. Mathan Somasundarum, a strategist at stock brokerage Baillieu Holst in Sydney, said a Clinton victory would reduce the risk of the United States adopting a strong trade protectionist policy. Trump has been highly critical of the NAFTA trade deal with Mexico and Canada as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has yet to be ratified by the U.S. Congress. He has promised to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it. I would expect the U.S. dollar to weaken and you would expect then there is some pressure coming off emerging markets, and then commodities, which (are a) proxy for emerging markets, Somasundarum said. China, commodities and the Aussie dollar should do better. While the markets had already begun to price in a Clinton victory even before the Republican partys crisis over Trumps 2005 remarks, some are beginning to game out what would happen if the Democrats won both houses of Congress, which are now Republican controlled.  The possibility of the Democrats controlling Congress and the White House is a concern to some in the markets as they see it leading to more regulation of businesses and higher taxes. Over time, people will start thinking, is this going to mean a big difference in the way taxation works? Is it going to mean more government involvement?, said Crabb at Old Mutual Global in Hong Kong. But the immediate reaction will be a relief rally. Angus Gluskie, managing director of White Funds Management in Sydney, said while markets usually view one party dominating the government as a risk, it could be different this time. Investors have been disappointed by the political stalemate over recent years, which has prevented meaningful and well-needed changes being pursued, Gluskie said. Steven Friedman, senior investment strategist at BNP Paris bas Investment Partners in New York, said he saw little in the debate that represented a game-changer for either candidate. This obviously plays to Clintons advantage, given her lead in the polls, he said. Strategists in a recent Reuters equity poll mostly viewed an election victory on Nov. 8 by Clinton as more positive for the stock market through the end of the year, largely because her positions - unlike her opponents - are well-known.  Chris Brankin, chief executive at stock brokerage TD Ameritrade Asia, said he thought Trump was much better prepared for the town hall debate in St. Louis than he was for the first debate, and that could give markets some pause.  I have always said markets know what they get with Hillary, as she as always been seen as pro-Wall Street and Trump is a bit of an unknown for investors.  After tonights debate I still think there are a lot of questions as who will be elected into office next month and markets are probably going to remain range-bound till after the U.S. elections.

"Hurricane Matthew toll in Haiti rises to 1,000, dead buried in mass graves","PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haiti started burying some of its dead in mass graves in the wake of Hurricane Matthew, a government official said on Sunday, as cholera spread in the devastated southwest and the death toll from the storm rose to 1,000 people. The powerful hurricane, the fiercest Caribbean storm in nearly a decade, slammed into Haiti on Tuesday with 145 mile-per-hour (233 kph) winds and torrential rains that left 1.4 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. A Reuters tally of numbers from local officials showed that 1,000 people were killed by the storm in Haiti, which has a population of about 10 million and is the poorest country in the Americas. The official death toll from the central civil protection agency is 336, a slower count because officials must visit each village to confirm the numbers. Authorities had to start burying the dead in mass graves in Jeremie because the bodies were starting to decompose, said Kedner Frenel, the most senior central government official in the GrandAnse region on Haitis western peninsula.  Frenel said 522 people were killed in GrandAnse alone. A tally of deaths reported by mayors from 15 of 18 municipalities in Sud Department on the south side of the peninsula showed 386 people there. In the rest of the country, 92 people were killed, the same tally showed.  Frenel said there was great concern about cholera spreading, and that authorities were focused on getting water, food and medication to the thousands of people living in shelters. Cholera causes severe diarrhea and can kill within hours if untreated. It is spread through contaminated water and has a short incubation period, which leads to rapid outbreaks. Government teams fanned out across the hard-hit southwestern tip of the country over the weekend to repair treatment centers and reach the epicenter of one outbreak.

Trump's body language during debate raises social media eyebrows," NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump paced, frowned and physically loomed at times over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton during Sunday nights town-hall debate, prompting bewilderment and mockery from some on social media.  The online reaction underscored the contentious tone of the encounter in St. Louis in which Trump and Clinton hurled insults at each other less than a month before the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.  Twitter users seized on Trumps body language, with some remarking that he appeared to have stalked Clinton around the stage. The criticism came as the Republican faces a political storm after being caught on a leaked 2005 videotape making lewd and demeaning remarks about women.  #Trumps body language [was] bizarre, wrote Twitter user Sheena (@texdakota). Pacing, insulting, standing right behind her.  Trumps body language freaked me out, wrote Charlotte (@charlotteirene8). I get very uncomfortable when men stand behind me, especially like that.  A spokeswoman for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Clintons performance inspired online criticism as well. Clinton could have done better, tweeted ryank (@ryantkelly). Didnt seem as hungry, as able to get under his skin tonight.  Sentiment on Trumps performance was 66.9 percent negative, according to an analysis by social intelligence firm Brandwatch of Twitter posts during the debate, while Clintons was 57.8 percent negative.  The debate, which featured questions from audience members, was the most tweeted-about debate ever, with more than 17 million tweets, said Twitter spokesman Nick Pacilio.  Trumps statement that he and running mate Mike Pence differed on their approach to military intervention in Syria was the most-talked-about moment of the night on the microblogging site.

"Trump, Clinton spend much of debate insulting each other"," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - There was a moment in Sundays U.S. presidential debate when Democrat Hillary Clinton was trying to fend off an attack from Republican rival Donald Trump about her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.  Its just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country, Clinton said of her rival for the Nov. 8 election.  Because youd be in jail, Trump shot back, drawing a mix of gasps and applause from the crowd that was defying instructions to remain silent.  It was one of the most explosive moments of the debate in St. Louis, and unprecedented for one presidential candidate to suggest on a debate stage that his opponent should be in jail.  The debate was crammed with moments that could at best be described as petty and at worse vicious - as the candidates traded personal attacks and sarcastic one-liners.  Trump frequently interrupted Clinton and sparred with the two debate moderators, who in turn chastised the crowd for occasional outbursts.  When moderator Anderson Cooper asked Clinton if Trump had the discipline to be a good leader, Clinton responded with one word: No.  Im shocked to hear that, Trump responded sarcastically.  He called Clinton names, including referring to her as the devil when discussing the support for her by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, Clinton's rival for the Democratic presidential nomination.  We have a divided nation, because people like her - and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart, Trump said a few minutes later.  Clinton in turn jabbed at Trump for his lewd remarks about women captured on a 2005 videotape released on Friday that has thrown his candidacy into crisis.  OK, Donald, I know youre into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way its exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you, Clinton said.  After 90 minutes of such harsh exchanges, the mood changed suddenly when the final question came from an audience member who asked each candidate to describe one admirable quality about the other.  I respect his children. His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald, Clinton said.  Trump said of Clinton: She doesnt quit, she doesnt give up, I respect that.  At the close of the debate, they shook hands, something they had notably avoided doing when the night started.

U.S. Republicans in crisis over Trump's vulgar video,"WASHINGTON/ST. LOUIS (Reuters) - The U.S. Republican Party on Sunday confronted its biggest crisis in more than 40 years when its presidential nominee, Donald Trump, faced a storm over sexually aggressive comments he made about women in a newly uncovered 2005 video. Only a month before the Nov. 8 election and on a day when Trump was due to debate Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump took to social media to squelch any speculation that he would leave the race. Tremendous support (except for some Republican leadership). Thank you, Trump wrote on Twitter. Then in a last-minute surprise in St. Louis, host city for the town-hall debate, Trump called journalists into a hotel room to witness a meeting he held with four women who revived accusations of past sexual misdeeds by Clintons husband, former President Bill Clinton. The party turmoil recalled past party crises, including the Watergate scandal that led to Republican President Richard Nixons resignation in 1974. A businessman-turned-politician previously best known to Americans as a reality TV show host, Trump, 70, faced his latest crisis when on Friday the 2005 video emerged in which he was heard talking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. The video was taped only months after Trump married his third wife, Melania. The controversy pitched Trump, 70, into the biggest crisis of his 16-month-old campaign and deepened fissures between him and establishment Republicans. On Sunday, he struck a defiant tone in the face of calls for him to abandon the race. A source close to the campaign of Trumps vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, dismissed talk among some political analysts the Indiana governor might bolt the ticket in the uproar over Trumps comments. Absolutely not, the source told Reuters. At a Democratic campaign event in Chicago, President Barack Obama weighed in on the controversy, saying Trump had been degrading not only to women, but to minorities, immigrants, people of other faiths, and the disabled. Obama said that tells you he is insecure. He pumps himself up by putting other people down, Obama said. With Republican Party leaders in crisis mode and doubts emerging over Trumps ability to draw support from crucial undecided voters, there were nonetheless some early signs many of his core supporters would remain loyal. A public opinion poll by POLITICO/Morning Consult, taken just after news broke of the video, found 39 percent of voters thought Trump should withdraw, and 45 percent said he should stay. Of those who said Trump should leave, only 12 percent identified themselves as Republicans. As of Sunday afternoon, at least 160 of the United States 332 sitting Republican governors, senators and House of Representatives members had condemned Trumps remarks, according to a Reuters review of official statements and local news coverage. At least 30 had called for him to withdraw from the race and three other officeholders said he should consider doing so. Eight of those said they were withdrawing their endorsement as well. Those facing a difficult re-election were more likely to speak out. All but six of the 40 Republican officeholders whose races are considered competitive had condemned Trumps comments on the video, although only three members of that group called for him to drop out. Any attempt to replace Trump on the ballot would face huge legal and logistical hurdles.  The Trump campaign was battling back, circulating talking points to a core of high-profile Republicans who promote Trump in the news media. The points sought to undermine establishment Republicans who have abandoned Trump. They are more concerned with their political future than they are about the future of the country, said a copy of the talking points, described to Reuters by two sources close to the campaign. A real estate developer making his first run at public office, Trump has made his battle against the establishment a central campaign theme. Phones have been blowing up for the past 24 hours, said a prominent Republican political operative in Washington, referring to a heavy volume of calls among party officials and Republican members of Congress.    DOWN-BALLOT RACES The operative, who did not want to be identified, said Trumps troubles could steer campaign donations away from him and to Republican candidates for Congress and other down-ballot offices. The source said Trump could help himself most during the presidential debate - the second of three before the election - if he addressed the video and an Oct. 1 New York Times report that he took so substantial a tax deduction on a declared $916 million loss in 1995 that he could legally have avoided paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years. Despite having recovered from a string of setbacks, Trump had an uphill battle to win the White House. Before the video surfaced, a Reuters/Ipsos poll had Clinton leading by 5 points on Friday. The question now is whether Trumps quest for the presidency has been dealt a lethal blow. ",politicsNews,"October 9, 2016 ",1
Pressure on Trump likely to be intense at second debate with Clinton," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, facing eroding support from his party over lewd remarks about women, goes into a second presidential debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton on Sunday needing to demonstrate he remains a credible candidate.  The pressure on the 70-year-old Trump at the debate will be intense. Not only must he parry attacks from Clinton and explain why he is a better alternative. He must also show an apologetic side to stop more Republican supporters from giving up on him.  Trump already had an uphill battle to win the White House in the Nov. 8 election before disclosure of a 2005 video in which he could be heard talking crudely about women.  A Reuters-Ipsos poll had Clinton leading by five points on Friday, before the video surfaced. Now, the question is whether Trumps quest for the presidency is all but over.  The fresh controversy adds an air of unpredictability over the 9 p.m. EDT debate at Washington University in St. Louis, the second of three scheduled presidential debates as the long-running U.S. election contest enters its final weeks.  It will be a town hall-style debate with undecided voters posing half the questions and the debates two moderators posing the others.  His vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, said on Sunday that Trump needs to show contrition.  We pray for his family and look forward to the opportunity to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tomorrow night, Pence said in a statement.  The crisis has put the Republican National Committee in a tight spot with less than a month to go until Election Day.  Trump would have to resign the nomination to allow Republican leaders to choose a successor, but the New York businessman is showing no signs of stepping down despite increasing calls from elected leaders for him to let Pence become the nominee.  The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly - I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE, WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN! Trump tweeted on Sunday from Trump Tower in New York.  At the first debate, on Sept. 26, Trump was repeatedly put on the defensive by Clinton. He never let her accusations go unanswered, and as a result he missed opportunities to use his speaking time to draw attention to Clintons perceived weaknesses.  Republicans said Trump needed to perform more like Pence, who was deemed the winner in his vice presidential debate against Democratic rival Tim Kaine last week.  Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said there is plenty Trump could learn from Pence, who stayed on offense at the vice-presidential debate, did not bother to respond to Kaines accusations, and looked calm and unflappable.  It was a clear lesson in how you avoid falling into your opponents traps, Bonjean said. Dont talk about what the other side wants you to talk about, focus on what you want to talk about.  Clinton has been hunkered down for days getting ready for what could be, for her, a knockout blow against Trump.  Before the video surfaced, Clinton campaign officials said they were expecting the Republican nominee to come to the debate more subdued than the first round.  But they were also prepared in case Trump follows through with a threat to focus on Clintons sometimes troubled marriage to former President Bill Clinton.  Clinton, who has already capitalized on Trumps treatment of women, herself foreshadowed how she might respond to an attack from Trump on her marriage during a speech to a fundraiser in Washington on Wednesday.  I feel its my responsibility not to defend myself against his attacks because, really, been there, done that, she said. I think its my responsibility to defend everybody else against his attacks, she said, drawing cheers from the crowd.  Clinton has her own issues to face. Wikileaks on Friday published an email from Clinton advisers appearing to contain excerpts of paid speeches to corporations, in which Clinton voices support for open trade and borders and says how sometimes it is important to have a public and private position.

Mexican peso surges ahead of U.S. presidential debate,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexicos peso surged more than 1.8 percent against the dollar on Sunday ahead of the U.S. presidential debate, after comments Donald Trump made about women in a video created a storm around his campaign. The currency moved after markets in Asia began Monday trading. At 3 p.m. CDT (2000 GMT), the peso had strengthened 1.89 percent to 18.955 per dollar. Republican nominee Donald Trump has vowed he would build a wall on the border with Mexico and renegotiate or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement if he is elected.  The United States is Mexicos main trading partner and Wall Street analysts say concern over any potential trade restrictions have hurt the peso. ",politicsNews,"October 9, 2016 ",1
Effort to replace Trump on ballot would face tremendous obstacles,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some prominent Republicans are urging Donald Trump to quit as the partys presidential nominee after video surfaced of him making vulgar comments about women but any attempt to replace Trump on the ballot would face huge legal and logistical hurdles. The real estate magnate has insisted he would never give up the White House race and wrote on Twitter on Sunday that Republicans who are attacking him are self-righteous hypocrites.     With only a month to go before the Nov. 8 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton, it would be a massive stretch to substitute Trump for his running mate Mike Pence or anyone else, Republican strategists and U.S. election experts said.     It is virtually impossible to replace somebody in August, let alone October, Republican strategist Karl Rove said on Fox News Sunday.  After a video of Trump making vulgar comments about women surfaced Friday, Republicans such as U.S. Senator Mike Lee of Utah and Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois urged Trump to remove himself from the race. The 2005 video showed Trump, then a reality TV star speaking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. The video was taped only months after Trump married his third wife, Melania.  Making a change at the top of the ticket for one of the two major parties this close to Election Day would be without precedent in the history of modern U.S. presidential elections. In 1972, Democratic presidential candidate George McGoverns running mate, Thomas Eagleton, was replaced after it was revealed that the vice presidential hopeful had been hospitalized for depression. Eagleton withdrew from the race in August of that year and was replaced by Sargent Shriver. In 2000, Missouri voters faced a last-minute candidate change in the states U.S. Senate race after the Democratic challenger Mel Carnahan died in a plane crash, a month before the election. Carnahans name remained on the ballot, however, and the dead man won the election. His widow, Jean Carnahan was appointed to fill the seat.   Republican party rules do not include a mechanism to involuntarily remove from the ticket a presidential candidate who has already been nominated.  The party does have procedure, known as Rule 9, that outlines the process for filling a vacancy if a nominee were to die or quit. Republican leaders could try to pressure Trump into resigning by withdrawing financial support for his campaign and withholding logistical help. But as of Sunday, Trump showed no sign of backing down and went on the attack against party figures who have suggested he leave the race. But if Trump were to decide to quit, the process would involve convening a 160-member committee of the Republican convention to select a new nominee, said Thomas Schwartz, a presidential historian at Vanderbilt University. Experts say such a step would lead to electoral chaos with Republican attorneys fighting state-by-state legal battles to make the last-minute candidate swaps on paper ballots, long after many state deadlines have already passed. Even more daunting, would be how to deal with early or overseas votes already cast. About 411,000 Americans already have voted in person or through the mail, according to Michael P. McDonald, a Florida State University political science professor who tracks early voting. The figure is sure to grow dramatically over the coming days. Early voting has already begun in six states and this week it will start in eight more. Another problem for Republicans is the risk of legal challenges to the election result. Concern about such challenges could deter some Republicans from voting. The Republican Party might argue that those ballots already cast for Trump should count toward electoral votes for the replacement candidate, said Matthew Dallek, an expert on presidential politics at George Washington Universitys Graduate School of Political Management. Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile said the party would likely challenge any effort by Republicans to replace Trump as their candidate on the ballot, adding that it would be very confusing for voters with early ballots already being cast. It would be political suicide for Donald Trump to step down right now, she told ABC News. Im sure my legal team is already looking at efforts underway, if there are any efforts underway, she said when asked if Democrats would oppose any effort by Republicans in the states to switch candidates on ballots. Dallek said an effort to substitute a new candidate at this point would lead to utter chaos. We would be operating in uncharted territory. You would be in this legal netherworld, he said.

Trump vows to stay in race after lewd remarks surface," (Editors Note: Attention language that may be offensive to some readers in paragraphs 22, 23, 24) By Emily Stephenson and Ginger Gibson NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With his campaign in crisis, U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump vowed on Saturday to stay in the race despite calls from more than two dozen prominent Republicans for him to drop out following the release of a recording of him making lewd comments about women. Both Trumps wife and his running mate criticized his words, saying they were insulting and indefensible.  The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly -  I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE, WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN! Trump wrote on Saturday afternoon on the social media website Twitter.   The video was the latest calamity for Trump, who had hoped to revive his flagging campaign in the face of a recent drop in polls with less than a month until Election Day.  Trump is due to appear alongside Democrat Hillary Clinton on Sunday in their second debate in the run-up to the general election. Clinton is not expected to address Trumps video before then.      The 2005 video of Trump talking on an open microphone showed the then-reality TV star speaking about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. The video was taped only months after Trump married his third wife, Melania. In a statement, Melania Trump called her husbands words unacceptable and offensive to me. This does not represent the man that I know, she said. He has the heart and mind of a leader. I hope people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world. The backlash over the video was swift and widespread.  More than 60 prominent Republican current and former officeholders issued statements condemning Trumps remarks about women, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and John McCain, the partys standard bearer in 2008. More than 20 called for Trump to end his presidential bid.  In an unusual move, his vice presidential running mate Mike Pence issued a critical statement of Trumps words, saying on Twitter that he cannot defend them. As a husband and father, I was offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump, said Pence, who is governor of Indiana. Pence indicated he would continue to support Trump, despite calls from several Republicans for Trump to step aside and let Pence be the nominee.     There is no precedent for a major party to replace its nominee this late in the campaign and it was unclear if there was an avenue to force him out. Voting has begun in several states, including swing states Virginia and North Carolina. A recorded apology by Trump early on Saturday did not stymie an avalanche of calls from members of his party to quit.  Trump huddled on Saturday in Trump Tower with senior advisers, including New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Despite previous scheduling, Giuliani will appear on five major Sunday morning news programs, a rare round robin reserved for major news events - replacing Republican Chairman Reince Priebus on CBSs Face the Nation and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway on Fox News Sunday, a last-minute switch. No reason was given for the bump of Conway. A CBS news release said the RNC asked to replace Priebus because Trumps operation wanted a campaign person to appear on the program. Trump left the building briefly to greet a small crowd of supporters, saying 100 percent he would remain in the race. Before returning to a bank of elevators, he told reporters, Tremendous support. He quickly moved to do damage control in Saturdays video in which he declared himself a changed man and attempted to shift the focus to his opponent Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. On Twitter, Trump posted critical statements from Juanita Broaddrick, a woman who has accused Bill Clinton of sexually assaulting her. Anyone who knows me knows these words dont reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize, Trump said in his video statement, posted on his Facebook page.     Trump has struggled to win over women voters, and the video was expected to further feed Democratic criticism about his past behavior toward women. Trumps support has suffered among suburban women and white, college-educated women, groups that Republicans have traditionally won. In the recording that triggered the firestorm, Trump said of one woman, I did try and fuck her. She was married. He went on to discuss his attraction to others. I just start kissing them, he said. And when youre a star they let you do it. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything, Trump said. On Saturday afternoon, CNN published a separate report detailing remarks Trump made over the course of several years while appearing on Howard Sterns radio program. The remarks included discussing the size of his daughters breasts and that he once had sex with three women at the same time. Trump was asked if he would have sex with a black woman and responded, It depends on what your definition of black is.  The remarks were the last straw for some Republicans who have stuck with him through a series of controversial remarks, including calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, calling for a ban on Muslim immigrants, attacking a judge of Mexican descent, attacking the Gold Star family of a Muslim soldier killed at war and saying Senator John McCain was not a war hero because he had been a prisoner of war. House Speaker Paul Ryan disinvited Trump to a scheduled appearance on Saturday in Wisconsin. Pence declined to speak in his place. The list of Republicans announcing they would not vote for Trump or calling on him to step aside grew on Saturday: Senators Kelly Ayotte, Lisa Murkowsi, Dan Sullivan, Mark Kirk, Jeff Flake, John Thune, Mike Crapo, Shelley Moore Capito and Mike Lee; House members Jason Chaffetz, Mia Love, Joe Heck, Bradley Byrne, Martha Roby and Barbara Comstock; and Governors John Kasich, Dennis Daugaard and Gary Herbert.  Additionally, former presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Carly Fiorina and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called on Trump to quit. Donald Trumps behavior this week, concluding with the disclosure of his demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults, make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy, McCain said in a statement.  While Democrats largely remained silent, opting to let Republicans attack one of their own, Vice President Joe Biden wrote on Twitter, The words are demeaning. Such behavior is an abuse of power. Its not lewd. Its sexual assault.  Some prominent Republicans indicated they would stick with Trump. Ralph Reed, head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, and Tony Perkins, head of the conservative Family Research Council, said they would continue to support him. I think 10 years ago he was a different man, said Representative Jack Kingston, a Republican from Georgia. I am very glad that he quickly apologized. ",politicsNews,"October 8, 2016 ",1
Sanders supporters seethe over Clinton's leaked remarks to Wall St.,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Supporters of former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Saturday expressed anger and vindication over leaked comments made by Hillary Clinton to banks and big business that appeared to confirm their fears about her support for global trade and tendency to cozy up to Wall Street. Clinton, who needs Sanders coalition of young and left-leaning voters to propel her to the presidency, pushes for open trade and open borders in one of the speeches, and takes a conciliatory approach to Wall Street, both positions she later backed away from in an effort to capture the popular appeal of Sanders attacks on trade deals and powerful banks.  The excerpts of remarks by the former secretary of state, made in 2013 and 2014 in closed-door meetings where audiences paid to attend, were published online on Friday by WikiLeaks, which sourced them to the email account of John Podesta, Clintons campaign chairman.  Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the speech transcripts. Clinton has previously declined to release any such transcripts. This is a very clear illustration of why there is a fundamental lack of trust from progressives for Hillary Clinton, said Tobita Chow, chair of the Peoples Lobby in Chicago, which endorsed Sanders in the primary election. The progressive movement needs to make a call to Secretary Clinton to clarify where she stands really on these issues and thats got to involve very clear renunciations of the positions that are revealed in these transcripts, Chow said. The revelations were quickly overshadowed by the release of an 11-year-old recording of Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, making lewd comments about women.  Clinton has worked hard to build trust with so-called progressives, adopting several of Sanders positions after she bested him in the primary race. The U.S. senator from Vermont now supports his former rival in the Nov. 8 general election against Trump. Still, Clinton has struggled to win support from young millennials who were crucial to Sanders success, and some Democrats expressed concern that the leaks would discourage those supporters from showing up to vote.  That is a big concern and this certainly doesnt help, said Larry Cohen, chair of the board of Our Revolution, a progressive organization formed in the wake of Sanders bid for the presidency, which aims to keep pushing the former candidates ideas at a grassroots level. It matters in terms of turnout, energy, volunteering, all those things. The Clinton campaign said it would not confirm the accuracy of the documents released by WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange.  We are not going to confirm the authenticity of stolen documents released by Julian Assange, who has made no secret of his desire to damage Hillary Clinton, said Glen Caplin, a campaign spokesman.  Guccifer 2.0 has already proven the warnings of top national security officials that documents can be faked as part of a sophisticated Russian misinformation campaign, he said, referring to the hacker or hacking group that altered some data stolen from the Democratic National Committee before making it public earlier this year.  The U.S. government on Friday formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations ahead of the election. The origin of the leaks did not dampen social media criticism of the speeches by some. Bernie was right about Hillary, wrote Facebook user Grace Tilly, shes a tool for Wall Street. Clinton is the politicians politician - exactly the Wall Street insider Bernie described, wrote Facebook user Brian Leach. Spokesmen for Sanders did not respond to requests for comment. NBC News quoted a statement from Sanders saying he would work to advance the Democrats policy platform. Whatever Secretary Clinton may or may not have said behind closed doors on Wall Street, I am determined to implement the agenda of the Democratic Party platform which was agreed to by her campaign, the statement said. Democratic strategist Steve Elmendorf said progressive voters would still choose the former first lady, even with misgivings. Id like to meet the Bernie Sanders supporter who is going to say, Well Im a little worried about her on international trade, so Im going to vote for Donald Trump, he said.

Clinton leads Trump by 5 points in presidential race: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton leads Republican rival Donald Trump by 5 percentage points among likely voters, roughly the same advantage she has held over the past several weeks, according to the Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll released Friday. The Sept. 30-Oct. 6 opinion poll showed that 43 percent of likely voters supported Clinton while 38 percent supported Trump. Clinton has consistently led Trump by 4-6 points in every weekly poll since the beginning of September. During this period, the candidates faced off in the most-watched presidential debate in history - a matchup that a majority of Americans believed Clinton won. The New York Times also released portions of Trumps 1995 tax returns that showed the celebrity real estate developer had reported a loss that was big enough to have allowed him to avoid paying personal taxes for a number of years. Clinton and Trump will meet again in their second debate on Sunday night, which will be in a town hall format, with the Nov. 8 election fast approaching. At this point in 2012, the race was tighter between Democratic President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney: Obama led Romney by less than 2 percentage points among likely voters in the Reuters/Ipsos poll during the first week of October. The incumbent eventually won the 2012 election by nearly the same margin in the popular vote. This year, however, both candidates appear to have a bigger opportunity to shake up the race and improve their numbers in the final weeks, given that a larger proportion of the electorate appears to be uncommitted.  When asked in the poll, roughly one out of every five likely voters would not pick either major party candidate and instead selected options such as Other, Wouldnt Vote or Refused. That was twice the number of uncommitted voters as there were in the Reuters/Ipsos poll at the same point in 2012. Americans have expressed a dim view of both Clinton and Trump this year. Both candidates are disliked by a majority of likely voters, according to the poll, and an increasing number of women have expressed an unfavorable view of both candidates this week. In a separate poll that includes alternative-party candidates, Clinton led the field by 5 percentage points. Among likely voters, 42 percent supported Clinton, 37 percent supported Trump, 8 percent picked Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and 2 percent supported Jill Stein of the Green Party. The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English in all 50 states. The poll included 1,695 people who were considered likely voters due to their registration status, voting history and stated intention to vote in the election. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. National opinion polls have differed this year in how they measure support for Clinton and Trump. Some polls, like Reuters/Ipsos, try to include only likely voters, while others include all registered voters. The Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll also gathers responses every day and reports results twice a week, so it often detects trends in sentiment before most other polls. An average of major opinion polls aggregated by RealClearPolitics showed Clinton ahead of Trump by 5 percentage points on Friday. ",politicsNews,"October 7, 2016 ",1
"Evangelical leaders stick with Trump, focus on defeating Clinton","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leaders of religious conservative groups largely stood behind Donald Trump on Saturday, the day after vulgar sexual comments he made about women surfaced online, but some expressed concern that the U.S. Republican presidential nominees remarks could depress evangelical turnout on Election Day. Most evangelical leaders did not condemn Trump, and instead pointed to an urgent need to prevent Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton from winning the presidency, reshaping the Supreme Court and implementing liberal policies. The latest blow to Trumps campaign came after a 2005 video surfaced of the then-reality TV star talking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. Vice presidential running mate Mike Pence said he could not defend Trumps words. Gary Bauer, chairman of the Campaign for Working Families, said Trumps grossly inappropriate language does not change the choice facing the country in the Nov. 8 election and that I continue to support the Trump-Pence ticket. Hillary Clinton is committed to enacting policies that will erode religious liberty, promote abortion, make our country less safe, and leave our borders unprotected, Bauer said. White evangelicals make up about 20 percent of the U.S. population, according to the Public Religion Research Institute, and represent a crucial voting bloc Trump needs to win the presidency. They have long represented a pillar of support for Republicans. In 2004, they were instrumental in President George W. Bushs re-election. They turned out in similar numbers in 2008 and 2012, when Mitt Romney, a Mormon who many evangelicals considered too moderate, was the Republican nominee, according to a report by the Pew Research Center. Support from evangelicals for Trump has been strong throughout his campaign, even though it was only late in life that the New York businessman adopted their cause. Social conservatives flocked to his side over other deeply religious Republican presidential candidates, such as Ted Cruz. Naturally Im disappointed, said Steve Scheffler, head of the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition. But, you know, the Bible tells me that we are all sinners saved by grace and I dont think theres probably a person alive that I know of that hasnt made some mistakes in the past. He said Clinton has peccadilloes of her own, most notably marital woes with her husband, former President Bill Clinton. So yes, I will vote for Donald Trump. Im not excusing his behavior at all. Its disgusting, he said. Still, politically active Christian conservative leaders across the country said they were worried that Trumps comments could depress turnout among evangelicals. Evangelicals are not going to vote for Hillary, said religious political activist David Lane. But this could cause them to stay home. This could be a big deal. Things like this matter. Much will hinge on Trumps performance in the second presidential debate on Sunday night, and whether he can convince Christians that he is a changed man, Lane said. He already apologized and said he was wrong, said Lane. I think hes moving in the right direction. But hes got to do really well in the debate Sunday night. Other religious leaders, however, were less forgiving. Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, tweeted an article detailing evangelical apathy toward the Trump tape, calling it a disgrace. What a scandal to the gospel of Jesus Christ and to the integrity of our witness, Moore wrote. Still, the majority view among religious conservatives appeared to be summed up by Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council action group, who said evangelicals are left with a choice of voting for the one who will do the least damage to our freedoms. This is far from an ideal situation, but it is the reality in which we find ourselves and as difficult as it is, I refuse to find sanctuary on the sidelines and allow the country and culture to deteriorate even further by continuing the policies of the last eight years, he said.

U.S. formally accuses Russian hackers of political cyber attacks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government for the first time on Friday formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russias senior-most officials could have authorized these activities, a U.S. government statement said on Friday about hacking of political groups. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process. U.S. intelligence officials concluded weeks ago that the Russian government was conducting or orchestrating cyber attacks against the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, possibly to disrupt or discredit the election, in which Democrat Hillary Clinton faces Republican Donald Trump. A Kremlin spokesman called the U.S. allegations nonsense, the Interfax news agency reported.  On Saturday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said the U.S. accusations lacked any proof and were an attempt by Washington to fan unprecedented anti-Russian hysteria. This whipping up of emotions regarding Russian hackers is used in the U.S. election campaign, and the current U.S. administration, taking part in this fight, is not averse to using dirty tricks, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Saturday in comments posted on the ministrys website. The Obama administrations decision to blame Russia for the attacks is the latest downward turn in U.S. relations with Moscow, which are under strain over Russias actions in Syria and Ukraine and in cyberspace. Also on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Russian and Syrian actions in the Syrian civil war, including bombings of hospitals, beg for a war crimes investigation. In addition, a U.S. intelligence official said on Friday that Russia was moving short-range nuclear-capable missiles into Kaliningrad, a tiny Russian enclave between Poland and Lithuania, confirming Estonian news reports. Clintons campaign chairman, John Podesta, said the public blaming for the hacks left one remaining question of why Donald Trump continues to make apologies for the Russians. Trump had previously expressed doubt about Russias involvement. In July, he suggested Russia should attempt to retrieve and publish emails from Clintons private server.  Trumps campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Hours after the U.S. governments accusation was levied, WikiLeaks posted hundreds of emails on its website purportedly hacked from Podestas private account. Until Friday, the Obama administration had avoided publicly singling out Russia in connection with the mounting civilian deaths in Syria or the cyber attacks. The statement by the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not blame the Russian government for hacking attempts against state election systems, but said scanning and probing of those systems originated in most cases from servers operated by a Russian company. However, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman said U.S. officials had concluded that the hacking attacks or probes of state voter registration systems were consistent with Russian motivations. Concern has grown about the reliability of the U.S. voting system as a result of the breach, and Trump has called the system rigged, but without providing specific evidence. U.S. intelligence officials have said there is no evidence that voting recording systems have been manipulated.  Identifying Russia as the actor behind the cyber attacks on political organizations falls short of more punitive measures the United States has taken against other countries for cyber intrusions.     Lawmakers of both political parties welcomed the formal accusation. Republican Senator Cory Gardner, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific and International Cybersecurity, said he planned to introduce sanctions legislation. Earlier this year, a U.S. grand jury indicted seven Iranians employed by two Iran-based computer firms on charges of hacking into the U.S. financial sector. In 2015, Obama announced sanctions against North Korea for hacking into Sony Pictures. In 2014, the United States charged five Chinese military hackers for economic espionage aimed at U.S. nuclear, metals and solar industries. A senior U.S. official said the administration is considering other retaliatory steps against Russia, but he declined to identify them. Those steps may remain covert, the official said.   The Democratic National Committee publicly disclosed intrusions into its systems in June and held Russia responsible. Leaks of committee emails from pro-transparency group WikiLeaks soon followed, demonstrating what appeared to be favoritism for Clinton over another Democrat, Bernie Sanders, by committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Wasserman Schultz, a Florida congresswoman, stepped down. In Fridays statement, the government said disclosures of emails by WikiLeaks and hacking entities known as DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0 are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts.  WikiLeaks has not identified the source of its leaks and criticized those who have claimed it was Russia. Guccifer 2.0 has identified itself as a Romanian hacker, but U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks are both a front for Russian spy units.

Transcript of Trump video statement in response to lewd remarks about women,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump issued a video statement early on Saturday in response to the disclosure of a 2005 videotape of him making lewd remarks about women. Here is a text of his statement: Ive never said Im a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that Im not. Ive said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them. Anyone who knows me knows these words dont reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong and I apologize. Ive traveled the country talking about change for America but my travels have also changed me. Ive spent time with grieving mothers who have lost their children, laid-off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries and people from all walks of life who just want a better future. I have gotten to know the great people of our country and I have been humbled by the faith they have placed in me. I pledge to be a better man tomorrow and will never, ever let you down. Lets be honest. Were living in the realworld. This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues were facing today. Were losing our jobs. Were less safe than we were eight years ago and Washington is totally broken. Hillary Clinton and her kind have run our country into the ground. Ive said some foolish things but theres a big difference between the words and actions of other people. Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday.

Trump says Pence to represent him at Wisconsin event on Saturday,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, under fire for vulgar comments caught on tape in 2005 and published on Friday, said that running mate Mike Pence would represent him at a Wisconsin campaign event on Saturday.

"Clinton campaign struggled to balance unions, environmentalists - emails/WikiLeaks","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton struggled with how to secure the endorsement of labor unions while announcing her opposition to the Keystone XL oil pipeline, a project they supported but environmentalists opposed, according to leaked emails published by Wikileaks on Friday. Before announcing in September 2015 that she opposed TransCanada Corps proposal to build a pipeline from Canada to the United States, her campaign sought to soften the blow to labor unions by offering an energy infrastructure plan that would create jobs, according to the emails.  The internal campaign emails from August 2015 reveal the difficulty Clinton had in appeasing both unions and environmentalists as she fought for her partys nomination ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Wikileaks published the Clinton emails just hours after the U.S. government accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations.     In the emails, Clinton advisers discussed how to frame the candidates energy infrastructure plan, which would call for replacing old pipelines, repairing rail tracks and improving the electric grid in a way that would appeal to labor unions, who had yet to endorse her at that stage. Could we mention that ... as we transition HRC wants to create more careers within the new energy economy? Careers is their buzz word, wrote Nikki Budzinski, labor outreach director for Hillary for America. Clinton had long avoided taking a firm position on Keystone, which had been pending for seven years, as she sought her partys nomination last year. As secretary of state, Clinton said in 2010 she was inclined to approve it.  Rival Senator Bernie Sanders had been a staunch opponent of the pipeline. President Barack Obama did not reject the pipeline until November 2015. Labor unions have pushed for approval of the pipeline, saying it would create thousands of construction jobs while environmentalists opposed it because it would increase greenhouse gas emissions from Canadas oil sands. The emails show that North Americas Building Trades, representing builders and construction workers, contacted the campaign after hearing that Obama would announce his denial of the pipeline in late August and that Clinton would say she encouraged him to make the decision.    We are so close to getting bldg (sic) trades [endorsement] and if we do this right, it will be ok even though they wont like it, wrote Amanda Renteria, the campaigns national political adviser. The Building Trades union endorsed Clinton in November and the Laborers International Union of North America endorsed Clinton in December.  Clintons struggle to please both green and labor groups is likely to emerge as a key challenge if she is to win the presidency. A decision over another pipeline, the Dakota Access, has sparked major protests from Native American and environmental groups. The Obama administration temporarily halted construction, frustrating unions. These types of decisions made by this administration get dumped in the presidential race and its kind of unfair, Sean McGarvey, president of North Americas Building TradesUnions, told Reuters in an interview last month.  We dont like all of Clintons energy policies but we think its reasonable. ",politicsNews,"October 8, 2016 ",1
Congresswoman raises concerns about VW settlement oversight,"SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A settlement with U.S. regulators gives Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) too much authority over how to spend $2 billion on electric vehicle technology, a U.S. congresswoman from California said this week in a letter, echoing concerns from states and others who fear the German automaker gains undue influence in the deal. Volkswagen agreed to spend $1.2 billion nationally and $800 million more in California on electric vehicle technology as penalties for equipping hundreds of thousands of diesel vehicles sold in the United States with software designed to cheat tailpipe emissions tests. The letter from Representative Anne Eshoo comes ahead of an Oct. 18 hearing at which a federal judge will consider whether to give final approval to $15.3 billion in settlements for owners, state and federal regulators or require changes and renegotiation. A provision of particular concern allows VW to make possible investments in its own proprietary technology and subsidiaries, Eshoo, a Democrat, said in the Oct. 4 letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lisa McCarthy. The EPA declined to comment. VW was not immediately available for comment. It has urged the court approve the deal. Eshoos fears mirror those raised by electric car-charging station companies in August. Four members of the California state legislature, in comments to the U.S. Department of Justice, also urged independent oversight and administration of the VW funds to ensure that multiple vendors with cutting-edge technology are able to enter the market.  The Justice Department said last month it received 1,195 comments period from private citizens, state and local government offices and agencies, businesses, and institutions and associations. The DOJ urged the agreements be approved with only minor changes.  Objectors face an uphill battle since U.S. courts generally give the government significant latitude to negotiate settlements.  The Justice Department said nearly half of the comments were submitted on behalf of a company that provides truck-stop electrification services to long-haul truck drivers, IdleAir, urging that the VW program be allowed to fund such projects.

U.S. pressed to disclose secret court's order on Yahoo email search,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. senator and civil groups critical of surveillance practices on Friday called on the government to release a 2015 order by a secret court directing Yahoo to scan all its users incoming email, saying it appeared to involve new interpretations of at least two important legal issues. Their concerns center on the nature of the technical assistance the court required Yahoo to provide and the scope of the search that legal experts said appeared to cover the Silicon Valley internet companys entire network. Yahoo installed a custom software program to search messages to hundreds of millions of accounts at the behest of U.S. intelligence officials with an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a secret tribunal, Reuters reported on Tuesday. They were looking for messages containing a single piece of digital content, three former employees and a fourth person apprised of the events told Reuters. Intelligence officials told Reuters that all Yahoo had to do was modify existing systems for stopping child pornography from being sent through its email or filtering spam messages. But the pornography filters are aimed only at video and still images and cannot search text, as the Yahoo program did. The spam filters, meanwhile, are viewable by many employees who curate them, and there is no confusion about where they sit in the software stack and how they operate. The court-ordered search Yahoo conducted, on the other hand, was done by a module attached to the Linux kernel - in other words, it was deeply buried near the core of the email server operating system, far below where mail sorting was handled, according to three former Yahoo employees. They said that made it hard to detect and also made it hard to figure out what the program was doing.  How much companies can be forced to do to comply with government orders for searching data is being debated in the courts. Companies have successfully argued that changes that would degrade users experience or force them to write new code, essentially a form of speech, would violate basic rights. Most famously, Apple refused to write code that would unlock an iPhone belonging to a gunman in last years mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. The FBI later dropped its demand. In the case of Yahoo, company security staff discovered a software program that was scanning email but ended an investigation when they found it had been approved by Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer, the sources said.  Lawmakers are concerned about the request and whether information about it is being properly disclosed to the public. Recent reports of a mass-email scanning program have alleged that federal law is being interpreted in ways that many Americans would find surprising and troubling, said Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a member of the intelligence committee and frequent critic of government surveillance programs.   The USA Freedom Act requires the executive branch to declassify Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court opinions that involve novel interpretations of laws or the Constitution, Wyden said.  Intelligence officials said the Yahoo order resembled other requests for monitoring online communications of suspected terrorists. The program is far different from the bulk collection of emails and telephone records that was disclosed by fugitive National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, they said, stressing the target was a digital signature associated with a single entitys suspected terrorist activity. But legal experts question whether the order might have stretched the concept of a facility used by a foreign power from its traditional definition, involving a single phone number or an email account, to include a large companys entire communication network. If the facility means all of Yahoos network, I dont see how thats consistent with the Fourth Amendment, which bars unreasonable searches, said Greg Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy & Technology.

Obama announces lifting of U.S. sanctions on Myanmar,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama formally announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Myanmar on Friday by terminating an emergency order that deemed the policies of the former military government a threat to U.S. national security. I have determined that the situation that gave rise to the national emergency ... has been significantly altered by Burmas (Myanmars) substantial advances to promote democracy, including historic elections in November 2015, Obama said in a letter to the U.S. House and Senate speakers. A U.S. Treasury statement said that as a result of the termination of the emergency order the economic and financial sanctions administered by the Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control were no longer in effect. The move followed a meeting between Myanmars de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and Obama in Washington last month, when she called for the lifting of economic sanctions against her country, and he said he was willing to do this. Suu Kyis National League for Democracy won a sweeping victory in the November elections. Obamas letter pointed to the formation of a democratically elected, civilian-led government as a result of the election, the release of many political prisoners and improved human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression and freedom of association and peaceful assembly. While Burma faces significant challenges, including the consolidation of its democracy, the United States can, and intends to, use other means to support the government and people of Burma in their efforts to address these challenges, Obamas letter said. Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and democracy icon, helped persuade the West to impose sanctions on Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, during her years as a jailed opposition leader. She is now trying to strike a balance between showing her people the economic rewards of a democratic transition while keeping pressure on the countrys generals for further reforms.   Some members of the U.S. Congress have expressed concerns about the extent and durability of change in Myanmar and introduced legislation seeking to give lawmakers some influence on the process of easing sanctions. Rights groups condemned last months announcement, saying it  forfeited leverage on Myanmars military. Officials of the U.S. administration have said the removal of sanctions would not apply to military-to-military assistance, given the extent of the militarys involvement in politics and rights abuses. Suu Kyi herself has been criticized for doing too little to address the plight of Myanmars stateless Rohingya Muslim  minority. The State Department said last month that several restrictions would remain in place, including barring visas for military leaders. ",politicsNews,"October 7, 2016 ",1
Trump apologizes for lewd talk caught on live microphone in 2005,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump issued an apology on Friday after the release of a video in which the Republican presidential candidate was recorded on an open microphone in 2005 talking in vulgar terms about trying to have sex with women. This was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago. Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course - not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended, Trump said in a statement released by his campaign. The video, released in a Washington Post story (wapo.st/2dSk1nD), was recorded while Trump was speaking with TV host Billy Bush of ""Access Hollywood"" while they were about to tape a segment about a planned cameo appearance by the New York businessman on the soap opera ""Days of Our Lives,"" the Post reported. Trump has faced repeated criticism for his comments about women, most recently involving his attacks on a former beauty queen with a vague and unsubstantiated allegation about a sex tape in predawn Twitter posts that prompted Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to denounce him as unhinged.

Two hawkish anti-immigration groups say consulted by Trump,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two groups that support far-reaching curbs on legal immigration to the United States and ideological screening of would-be immigrants to test their beliefs say Donald Trumps presidential campaign has consulted them on his immigration policy. NumbersUSA and the Center for Immigration Studies, which for years have denied accusations they harbor radical views on immigration, told Reuters they had met or had telephone calls with either Trump or senior members of his campaign over the past year. Trumps campaign declined to confirm the meetings. Trump, the Republican nominee, has won over millions ofsupporters with his calls for a wall on the Mexican border and a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. But the calls have also drawn an outcry from immigrant rights groups and condemnation from abroad.  While Trumps immigration proposals push the Republican Party sharply to the right, NumbersUSA and CIS also want to slash legal immigration, going beyond the New York businessmans call to keep it within historical norms. NumbersUSA says on its website that immigrants are the main driver of population growth, take jobs that should go to U.S. workers, and fuel urban sprawl that threatens farmland and wildlife habitats.  The aim should be to halt all immigration possible, NumbersUSA head Roy Beck wrote in a blog in March. NumbersUSA wants to cut legal immigration to 500,000 a year immediately, said Chris Chmielenski, the groups director of content and activism. About a million immigrants obtain legal permanent residence status in the United States every year, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Around 11 million undocumented immigrants were living in the United States in 2014, down from a peak of 12 million in 2007, according to the Pew Research Center. The head of CIS, Mark Krikorian, has argued against legal immigration extensively. Last year he wrote in the National Review that mass legal immigration would end U.S. conservatism, because immigrants tend to have more liberal views on issues like gun rights. Beck told Reuters he had met with Trump in New York and had also spoken with people at the top of his campaign repeatedly since last autumn, when NumbersUSA accepted invitations to meet several Republican presidential hopefuls. Much of the contact was by phone and email. Beck would not provide details of what was discussed or say who took part in the discussions. In early August, NumbersUSA shared a 10-point immigration plan with the Trump campaign. Of the 10 points, six were echoed by Trump in a major immigration speech on Aug. 31. Those points included calls for the immediate deportation of undocumented immigrants with criminal records and the mandatory use of the E-verify system to check a job applicants legal status.  The Trump campaign declined to comment on the apparent overlap. The policy was written with input from Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and Border Patrol agents. Beck said the overlap showed the convergence of ideas between his group and the campaign but he acknowledged he had no indication that they sat down and looked at our 10 steps and said lets take six of them.     Based in Arlington, Virginia, NumbersUSA describes itself as the the nations largest grassroots immigration-reduction organization with more than 5 million participants. It is credited with helping block immigration bills in 2007 and 2013 that aimed to make it easier for undocumented immigrants to become citizens. Krikorian, of CIS, whose slogan is Low-immigration, pro-immigrant, said his group had also received requests for research and studies from the Trump campaign for months.  In an Aug. 15 speech, Trump outlined his plan for extreme vetting of immigrants, calling for an ideological test to gauge their views on things like religious freedom, gender equality and gay rights to ensure the country only admits people who share our values and respect our people.  CIS was an early proponent of ideological screening - widely criticized as discriminatory and a violation of freedom of thought - to protect U.S. culture and national security following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but it was unclear if Trump consulted CIS on the idea. The Department of Homeland Security already requires people seeking legal status in the United States to show they adhere to the principles of the Constitution. Krikorian took part in a roundtable of national security advisers at Trumps New York headquarters in August, after which he said he was asked by Trumps campaign to be a surrogate. A surrogate can act on behalf of a campaign, by speaking at rallies and other events. Krikorian said he turned down the Trump campaigns request.  Hate watchdog groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League have accused NumbersUSA and CIS of attempting to use mainstream arguments to sell proposals aligned with white nationalism.

Both organizations reject the claims. Were absolutely opposed to nativism, said Beck, adding that NumbersUSAs recommendations come from a desire to protect American workers.

Trump's Indian-American fan spreads the word back home,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Donald Trump sympathizes with India in its recent escalation of tensions with Pakistan and supports skilled immigration, an adviser said on Friday, portraying the U.S. presidential hopeful as a friend of India and Indian Americans. Trump, a real estate billionaire, has earned a reputation of hostility toward minorities with proposals such as extreme vetting of potential immigrants and building a wall along the Mexican border to stop illegal immigration.  The Republican nominee has proposed a ban on immigration from countries where vetting would be difficult, such as nations faced with Islamic militancy. Some Indian officials worry the United States could become more isolationist under Trump, leaving allies like New Delhi without the support it has enjoyed under President Barack Obama against Chinas growing regional influence.      Shalabh Kumar, a Chicago-based businessman of Indian origin tasked by the Trump campaign with reaching out to Asian-Americans, said India and the Indian-American community had nothing to fear from a Trump presidency.    There may be only 4 million Indian Americans but the potential to develop the relationship with their country of origin, a land of 1.3 billion, was huge, Kumar told a news conference at a hotel in New Delhi that drew a curious audience of about 30 journalists and several TV cameras. Our overarching goal is for the 21st century to be an Indian-American century - instead of a Sino-American century, said Kumar, wearing a dark suit and gold-rimmed pilot glasses, his white hair swept back.     Mr Trump is a businessman - he has no bone in his body, not a drop of blood that is anti-immigrant, Kumar said. He wants to have legal, skills-based immigration. The Punjabi-born businessman, who emigrated in 1969 and was converted to the Republican cause by Ronald Reagan, also said Trumps determination to keep Islamic militants out of the United States played well with his community.  Around four in five Indians profess the Hindu faith, while 14 percent are Muslims. Hindu nationalist groups, including many Indian Americans, have applauded Trumps anti-Muslim comments. There is a war declared on the free world by Islamic terrorists, Kumar said. We are very happy that India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken a very firm stand. Kumar said the Republican Hindu Coalition, a group that he set up last year, would hold a cultural event and charity fundraiser in New Jersey on Oct. 15 at which Trump will deliver a keynote address. Half of the gate receipts would go to victims of terrorism, in particular Hindu refugees from Kashmir and Bangladesh. ",politicsNews,"October 7, 2016 ",1
Republican Trump says 70 percent of federal regulations 'can go',"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said as many as 70 percent of federal agency regulations could be eliminated if he is elected in November, just hours after an adviser said the candidate would seek to cut 10 percent.     Trump, who blamed regulations for stifling business, told a crowd at a town hall event in New Hampshire on Thursday night that regulations for the environment and safety would remain.  We are cutting the regulation at a tremendous clip. I would say 70 percent of regulations can go, Trump said. Its just stopping businesses from growing. Earlier in the day during an online discussion with Reuters, Trump campaign adviser Anthony Scaramucci, a Wall Street financier who has raised campaign money for Trump, said Trump would eliminate 10 percent of regulations. We need regulation but immediately every agency will be asked to rate the importance of their regulations and we will push to remove 10 percent of the least important, he said.     Another Trump campaign adviser reached by Reuters confirmed the 10 percent regulatory cut was part of their economic plan.  Jeff Holmstead, a former assistant administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency under George W. Bushs presidency, said the goal was hard to comprehend. You could reduce the number of regulations by 10 percent without accomplishing very much, he said. He added it would make more sense for Trump to try to reduce the cost of regulatory compliance by 10 percent. I think it probably would be possible for a new administration to make changes that would reduce the cost of these programs by at least 10 percent while still maintaining essentially the same level of environmental protection, he said. Officials at the EPA and the U.S. Department of the Interior declined to comment, citing internal policies. Scaramucci also said that Trump, a fierce critic of the Federal Reserve, would probably get along well with Fed Chair Janet Yellen.  Trump has repeatedly accused the Fed of serving as a political arm of the Obama White House. He says Yellen has put off raising interest rates in order to let President Barack Obama end his term in January without the economic shock that a rise in interest rates might entail. Scaramucci, a founder of SkyBridge Capital, joined Reuters Global Markets Forum to discuss his views of the campaign. He said Trump would strive for a better balance in federal regulations.     Scaramucci was not as dismissive of Yellen as Trump is, saying he believes the New York property developer would warm to her eventually. There are many well-qualified candidates but I think Mr. Trump has to spend some time with chairwoman Yellen. I think knowing what I know about his personality he will like her, he said. Trump would seek to streamline regulations as a way to generate economic growth and help the flow of capital, the adviser said. Trump has specifically singled out the energy industry as an area that he would look at for reducing regulations. Wall Street is not the devil, said Scaramucci. In fact we are at our best when (there) is harmony between Main Street and Wall Street and we hope to restore that. Scaramucci singled out several areas that Trump would look to for reforms: Labor Department rules expanding the fiduciary standard for financial brokers who sell retirement products would likely be stopped. Legislation similar to the former Glass-Steagall Act that limited the banking industry would be on the table for review.  The Dodd-Frank banking reforms that emerged from the Great Recession of 2008-09 will be reviewed and the worst anti-business parts of it will be gutted.  The Volcker rule will be adjusted. Named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, it is part of the sweeping 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. It aims to reduce risk-taking by preventing banks from using their own capital to make speculative bets.     ",politicsNews,"October 6, 2016 ",1
NRA gun rights group pours money into Republican U.S. Senate campaigns,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Rifle Association is on track for record spending this year on U.S. political campaigns, including Missouris U.S. Senate race where a gun-owning Democrat is waging a tough fight against an incumbent Republican backed by the gun rights group. Democrat Jason Kander, an Afghanistan war veteran, is running just 2.5 percentage points behind Republican U.S. Senator Roy Blunt in opinion polls in Missouri, despite the NRAs expenditure of $1.8 million so far trying to protect Blunt as well as the Republicans U.S. Senate majority. Gun violence has transfixed the United States in 2016, from a massacre at an Orlando, Florida, nightclub to a rash of police shootings, fueling demands by some Democrats and activists for tighter gun laws. Those efforts have been thwarted, as in years past, by the NRA and its supporters, who say such measures would infringe on the right to bear arms guaranteed by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Congress has not approved major gun-control legislation since the 1990s. An Aug. 19 Reuters/Ipsos poll found 41.8 percent of respondents agreed there should be strong restrictions on firearms and 22.4 percent supported moderate regulations.     Per-capita firearm ownership in the United States far exceeds any other country, according to government estimates.   In the Missouri race and other Senate contests in states such as North Carolina, Nevada, Florida and New Hampshire, the gun-control battle gripping Washington is playing out on the campaign trail. The NRA has spent $23.4 million in this election cycle, with a month to go before voting on Nov. 8, compared with a previous high of $27 million in the entire 2014 campaign cycle, according to federal data gathered by the Center for Responsive Politics. The NRA did not respond to requests for comment. In addition to Senate Republicans, the lobbying group is also backing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Blunt, 66, is a two-decade veteran of Congress. He accuses Kander, 35, of being soft on gun ownership rights. Blunt has an A rating from the NRA. Kander has an F, which the NRA says he earned by backing expanded background checks on gun buyers and legislation that failed this year in Congress to bar people on terrorism watch lists from buying guns. The difference between Senator Blunt and myself is that I want to stop criminals and suspected terrorists from having the same access to guns as the rest of us, which is why I support background checks, Kander said in a statement to Reuters on Thursday. Kander, Missouris secretary of state, counterpunched against Blunt last month with a 30-second TV commercial that has had more than 1 million views on youtube.com.  In the ad, the former U.S. Army captain assembles a military-style rifle while blindfolded. He says he has supported gun ownership rights, but adds: I also believe in background checks so that terrorists cant get their hands on one of these. A fierce debate in Washington over such background checks in June led to a 25-hour sit-in by Democrats on the floor of the House of Representatives.  The reaction to that ad has reset the debate in the Missouri Senate race, said Tim Daly, managing director of guns and crime policy for the liberal Center For American Progress, a think tank in Washington. Kanders polling numbers were already rising when the Sept. 15 ad was first broadcast. But Daly said Kander planted fresh doubts over the NRA position on background checks. Blunt and his campaign spokesmen were not available for comment.  The NRA is Blunts No. 2 financial backer in the Missouri race, surpassed only by a group closely associated with U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that backs Republicans. Like the Blunt-Kander battle, other key 2016 Senate races feature intense debate over guns as Republicans work to defend their control of the Senate. In North Carolina, the NRA has pumped in $2.8 million to support threatened incumbent Republican Senator Richard Burr. The first televised debate in New Hampshire this week between Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte and her Democratic challenger, Governor Maggie Hassan, began with a moderator asking how they could reduce gun violence without infringing on gun rights. Ayotte has come under attack from Americans for Responsible Solutions for her opposition to tough gun background checks. The group works to reduce U.S. gun violence in the United States.

"Jill Biden, wife of U.S. vice president, arrives in Cuba","HAVANA (Reuters) - Jill Biden, wife of U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, arrived in Cuba on Thursday, the latest sign of the rapprochement between the Cold War foes that saw President Barack Obama and his family visit in March. Biden was greeted at Havanas international airport by Josefina Vidal, who is leading negotiations with the United States as head of U.S. affairs at the Cuban Foreign Ministry. Biden plans to watch a match between the U.S. and Cuban soccer teams on Friday in Havana, go on social media at one of Cubas new WiFi hot spots and visit a teachers college, among other activities, according to U.S. diplomatic sources in Havana.  Ambassador-at-Large for Global Womens Issues Cathy Russell and Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs Evan Ryan are accompanying Biden, who will also travel to central Camaguey province before heading to the Dominican Republic on Sunday. A White House statement said Biden, herself an educator, was scheduled to meet with government officials and engage with a diverse range of Cubans on topics related to culture, education, and health.     The Obamas visit highlighted the warming trend in bilateral relations announced by both countries in December 2014 after 18 months of secret talks and more than a half-centurys estrangement. Some U.S. lawmakers strongly oppose the move, arguing that Communist-ruled Cuba must do far more to improve human rights before it can deal normally with the United States. Agreements have been reached in areas such as law enforcement, the environment, resumption of postal service and commercial flights, while talks on such thorny issues as  fugitives and reparations continue. The decades-long U.S. trade embargo on Cuba remains in place and can only be lifted by Congress, although Obama has used his executive authority to chip away at it. Both sides have said they want to strengthen their economic relationship, but the United States has complained the Cubans have been slow to take advantage of openings carved out by Obama, for example, trade with the private sector, while Cuba says U.S. sanctions make most trade and investment impossible. U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman is also in Havana where he is scheduled to meet on Friday with Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez and Foreign Trade and Investment Minister Rodrigo Malmierca.

Trump has shifted away from complete Muslim ban: Pence,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump has backed away from a total ban on Muslims entering the United States, vice presidential running mate Mike Pence said on Thursday, a shift from one of the Republican presidential candidates most provocative proposals. Trumps call last December for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States followed an Islamic State-inspired mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, by a husband-and-wife team. Critics have called the proposed ban discriminatory and probably a violation of the U.S. Constitutions guarantee of freedom of religion, and Democrats have used Trumps policy to declare him a bigot. In recent months, Trump has said he would suspend immigration from countries where Islamist militants are active but has left vague as to whether this amounted to a narrowing or an expansion of his original policy position.Pence said in a round of television interviews that if elected on Nov. 8, Trump would suspend immigration from countries that have been compromised by terrorism. Asked if this amounted to a ban on Muslims, Pence said on MSNBCs Morning Joe show: Of course not. On CNNs New Day, Pence was asked why, given that he had been against the ban before becoming Trumps running mate, he was not opposing it now. Well, because its not Donald Trumps position now, replied Pence. ",politicsNews,"October 6, 2016 ",1
"Factbox: Clinton's policies on economy, Islamic State, other issues","(Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has pledged to raise taxes on the wealthy, preserve the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and provide a path to citizenship for undocumented workers.	 Here are the proposals the former secretary of state has made as part of her argument that she is best qualified to occupy the Oval Office. (For a Factbox on Republican opponent Donald Trumps proposals, please see) Clinton has said the rich, not the middle class, would see their taxes go up. She supports billionaire investor Warren Buffetts eponymous tax proposal calling for those making more than $1 million a year to pay an effective tax rate of 30 percent. Clinton has also called for an additional 4 percent tax on those making more than $5 million annually. Clinton has pledged to raise the estate tax levied on property transferred from a deceased person to their heirs. She also supports a tiered inheritance tax structure, with a top rate of 65 percent on the wealthiest estates of more than $500 million for a single person or $1 billion for a couple. Clinton has pledged to unveil a plan to rebuild U.S. infrastructure during her first 100 days, saying this would create new jobs. She would use some of the revenue generated from her tax plan to pay for making community colleges tuition-free and ensuring students can graduate from public colleges and universities without incurring debt. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group that independently scored Clintons proposals in their totality, estimated her policies would cost $1.8 trillion over the next decade and would be offset by $1.6 trillion, mostly generated by taxing high earners. The group said the remaining $200 billion could be covered by $275 billion in corporate tax revenue the Clinton campaign has called for but not yet spelled out in sufficient detail for them to credit as an offset at this time. Clinton has promised to propose broad legislation within her first 100 days in office to overhaul the immigration system and establish a process for undocumented workers to become citizens. Clinton has said she will defend executive actions taken by Democratic President Barack Obama to defer deportations of children brought illegally to the United States and the parents of children who are citizens or legal residents. She has said if Congress does not pass comprehensive immigration reform, she will similarly use executive action to defer deportations in sympathetic cases. A federal court has ruled that Obama did not have the authority to issue his executive orders on immigration, known as DACA and DAPA. The U.S. Supreme Court, currently short one member, split 4-to-4 on whether to hear the administrations appeal, leaving the lower courts ruling in place for the time being. Clinton has promised to preserve the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted after the financial crisis, and to pursue further measures to toughen Wall Street regulations. She has proposed a fee for large financial institutions based on their size and the level of risk they pose. She would also give regulators additional authority to force institutions that pose high risks to break apart or reorganize. Clinton has also urged strengthening the Volcker Rule, which restricts proprietary trading by commercial banks. She has called for a new tax on high-frequency trading and for stricter oversight of hedge funds, private equity firms and other players in the so-called shadow-banking system. She has promised stiffer policies on people who commit financial crimes, including an extension of the statute of limitations on such crimes and a requirement for bank executives to return bonuses if their institutions suffer major losses. Changes to Dodd-Frank have stalled in the Republican-controlled Congress, and it is unclear whether Clinton could get congressional backing to strengthen the law, unless Democrats win control of one or both chambers in the Nov. 8 election. Clinton has pledged to defeat Islamic State and has said the first step to fighting the militant group is to eliminate its strongholds in Iraq and Syria. In a departure from the Obama administration, she supports the establishment of a no-fly zone over Syria and has called for an intensified air campaign by the U.S.-led coalition. Clinton has said she would send additional American special forces to help Arab and Kurdish forces already on the ground. She opposes sending additional U.S. ground troops to the region. Clinton has said the United States and European allies must share intelligence more effectively in order to thwart potential attacks. She has urged Silicon Valley companies to work with the government to track militant recruitment tactics on the internet.  Current and former Obama administration officials have told Reuters they believe Clinton would  take a harder line on Russia than either Obama or Trump. Clinton has said she believes Russian hackers are behind the breach of Democratic Party systems in an attempt to influence the U.S. presidential election. Clinton has said Russia should play a role in fighting Islamic State in Syria, and her foreign policy adviser has said she would consider arming government forces in Ukraine, one of Russias neighbors, in a move to combat Russian aggression in Europe. Russia has backed ethnic Russian separatists in Ukraine. Clinton was a key player in Obamas pivot to Asia when she served as his secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Clinton has said she will aggressively pursue trade cases and impose consequences against China when it commits trade abuses. She opposes granting China market-economy status, which China will be seeking when a World Trade Organization clause expires in December, and has said she would make sure a newly installed trade prosecutor would ensure that China is playing by the rules. Clinton has said she would treat cyber attacks from countries such as Russia and China like any other attack and that the United States will be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.

"Factbox: Trump's policies on immigration, economy, other issues","(Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump wants to build a wall on the border with Mexico, boost spending on the military and slap trade tariffs on China. Here are those positions and others the New York businessman, who has never held elective office, has put forward to convince the American people that he should be the next U.S. chief executive. (For a Factbox on Democratic opponent Hillary Clintons proposals, please see) Trump has proposed collapsing the current seven income tax brackets to three with rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent. The current top rate is 39.6 percent. He also would eliminatethe estate tax, and slash the corporate rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. Trump has proposed increasing spending on the U.S. military and infrastructure but says he would reduce spending on other categories by 1 percent each year. However, the Social Security and Medicare programs for the elderly would be exempt from cuts. His plan would allow families to deduct childcare costs from income taxes and offer further support through an existing tax credit for lower-income people. He would also provide six weeks of paid maternity leave for new mothers through temporary unemployment insurance. He has proposed paying for it by cracking down on fraud in the unemployment insurance program and through other changes to the system. Some economists questioned whether Trumps ideas for reducing spending would be enough to make up for major tax cuts, particularly since many Republicans believe Medicare and Social Security must be revamped to control government outlays. Trump launched his presidential campaign with his vow to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and has said he would insist that the United States southern neighbor pay for it. He has promised to triple the number of immigration enforcement officers, hire more Border Patrol agents and boost penalties for overstaying visas. Trump has said he would prioritize the deportation of people in the United States illegally who have committed crimes and of those who have arrived recently or overstayed visas. He would require people seeking legal status to leave and reapply. Trump said that after his immigration goals are achieved, he would determine what to do about people still in the country illegally. Trump has proposed ideological screening, or extreme vetting, of people coming to the United States to determine whether they share American values. He has proposed a banon immigration from countries where vetting would be difficult. Initially, he proposed a temporary ban on all Muslims from entering the United States. Critics, including some of Trumps defeated rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, said that policy would be discriminatory and likely violate the U.S. Constitutions guarantee of freedom of religion. Others have since said his extreme vetting idea might not be feasible. Trump has promised a dismantling of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted following the financial crisis, but has given few details. The Republican Partys platform calls for reinstating Glass-Steagall, the 1930s-era law that forced the separation of investment banks from deposit-taking institutions. Trumps former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, said in July that his campaign backed this change. Republican lawmakers have so far been unable to undo many of their most-despised pieces of the Dodd-Frank law, and many in their ranks oppose a return to Glass-Steagall. Trump has offered few details about his plans to fight Islamic State but has said he would knock the hell out of the militant group. He says he is keeping the details of strategy a secret so as not to disclose them to the enemy. Trump has said if he wins, he would give U.S. generals 30 days after he takes office on Jan. 20, 2017 to propose their own plans. Trump has said he opposes accepting refugees fleeing violence in Syria, and instead has said he would create safe zones there, which he says would be funded by Gulf states. President Barack Obama has said a safe zone in Syria would require a large U.S. military commitment, something that could prove to be unpopular with Americans weary of lengthy wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Trump has said he would have a very, very good relationship with Russia. He has said he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was a better leader than Obama. Trump has said could work with Russia to combat Islamic State. He also said he would look into recognizing Crimea, seized from Ukraine in 2014, as Russian territory and lifting sanctions on Russia imposed by Western nations for what they called an illegal land grab. Trump has criticized the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, saying some U.S. allies have not met their defense commitments. In July, he said if Russia attacked a NATO member, he would consider whether the country has paid up before providing defense. NATO leaders say the sanctions against Russia are key to persuading it to change that countrys behavior in Ukraine, where it has backed ethnic Russian separatists, and that the alliance has long been focused on fighting international terrorism. Trump has made criticism of Chinas trade practices a central campaign theme. He has vowed to formally label China a currency manipulator, impose tariffs on Chinese imports and bring unfair trade cases as punishment for what he believes are improper subsidies. Trump has called for a stronger U.S. military presence in the South China Sea. He has said he would pull the United States out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. Though the trade agreement does not include China, Trump has said he is concerned it could try to enter it through the back door. TPP supporters, including Obama, have said China hoped to reach its own deal that would make it the leader in Asian trade. They have said the pact would enable the United States to take a leadership role in the region instead of China. ",politicsNews,"October 6, 2016 ",1
Exclusive: U.S. lawmakers to investigate funding of WHO cancer agency,"LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Officials from the U.S. governments health research agency are to be questioned by a congressional committee about why taxpayers are funding a World Health Organization cancer agency facing criticism over how it classifies carcinogens. An aide to the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform told Reuters that National Institutes of Health officials have agreed to give an in-person briefing to the committee after questions were raised by lawmakers over its grants to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a semi-autonomous part of the WHO based in Lyon, France. The hearing will be in private, with NIH officials answering questions from committee investigators, the aide said.  The committee is working with the NIH to schedule the briefing soon, the aide said, but no date has yet been set.  The briefing comes after the committees chairman added his voice to growing concerns among some senior U.S. lawmakers about the way IARC reviews and classifies substances. In recent years IARC has caused controversy over whether such things as coffee, mobile phones, processed meat and the weed killer glyphosate cause cancer. Its critics, including in industry, say it is sometimes too quick to conclude that substances might cause cancer, causing unnecessary health scares. It defends its methods as scientifically sound. In a Sept. 26 letter to NIH director Francis Collins, Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz describes IARC as having a record of controversy, retractions, and inconsistencies and asks why the NIH, which has a $33 billion annual budget, continues to fund it.  IARCs standards and determinations for classifying substances as carcinogenic, and therefore cancer-causing, appear inconsistent with other scientific research, and have generated much controversy and alarm, Chaffetz wrote. The NIH confirmed in an email to Reuters that it had received Chaffetzs letter and will respond directly to the committee. The WHO referred Reuters to IARC for comment. A spokeswoman for IARC told Reuters that Chaffetzs letter contained misconceptions which IARCs director, Chris Wild, has sought to address in a letter of his own to the NIH director. Wilds letter, dated Oct. 5 and copied via email to Reuters on Thursday, rejects Chaffetzs criticisms and says IARCs classifications, known as monographs, are widely respected for their scientific rigor, standardized and transparent process and ... freedom from conflicts of interest. Wild also defends IARCs evaluation of coffee and disputed Chaffetzs description of it as a retraction. IARCs previous assessment of coffee as possibly carcinogenic was updated in June this year, when IARC said it had found no conclusive evidence for a carcinogenic effect. The (coffee) report in 2016 was not a retraction but a re-evaluation based on an additional 25 years of scientific evidence, Wild said. Chaffetz, however, asks the NIH to detail its standards for awarding grants and the vetting and oversight of grantees. It also asks for full disclosure of NIH funds to IARC or money spent in relation to IARCs activities. Questions over grants awarded by NIH to IARC could put a significant portion of IARCs funding at risk. IARCs resources are relatively modest. Its 2014 revenue was about 30 million euros ($33 million). In his letter, Chaffetzs cites the NIHs grant database as showing that it has given IARC more than $1.2 million so far this year. The database also shows that since 1992, NIH grants to IARC have totaled some $40 million. The American Chemistry Council also joined those voicing concern, issuing a statement following Chaffetzs letter accusing IARC of a long history of passing judgment on substances through a fundamentally-flawed process that yields questionable results. We welcome the interest of the House Committee ... and hope it will shed light on the close and somewhat opaque relationship between IARC and NIH, including the use of taxpayer dollars and resources to support IARCs activities, it said. IARC is also in dispute with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and United Nations and United States regulators over glyphosate, a widely-used weedkiller developed by Monsanto.  IARC says glyphosate is probably carcinogenic, while EFSA and several other regulators say it isnt.  This dispute prompted Robert Aderholt, chairman of the U.S.  congressional Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, to write in June to NIHs Collins questioning funding of IARC. In that letter, Aderholt says IARCs conclusions appear to be the result of a significantly flawed process and adds that some in academia have raised questions about the quality of the science and the transparency of the process.  The glyphosate dispute also held up a decision on whether to relicense the product for use in Europe. ($1 = 0.8941 euros) ",politicsNews,"October 6, 2016 ",1
U.S. Republican group hit by Russian-linked virus: researcher,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Republican Party website selling campaign stickers and other political gear is among thousands of websites infected with a credit-card stealing virus that sent data to a server in Russia, according to a Dutch security researcher.     A page on the National Republican Senatorial Committees  website selling stickers, T-shirts and baseball caps was infected with a hard-to-detect virus that collected all information entered on orders, including buyers names and addresses, credit card numbers and merchandise ordered, according to the researcher, Willem de Groot. De Groot, co-founder of Dutch e-commerce company Byte, said that he learned of the infection after conducting a web scan to find sites infected with the virus. I dont think it was a targeted attack, de Groot told Reuters. Other victims include clothing retailers, car manufacturers and local shops. He declined to identify them, saying he had not had time to notify them of the infection.  The NRSC took down the website on Thursday and acknowledged that it had been targeted by a skimming operation.  NRSC spokeswoman Andrea Bozek said a vendor discovered an issue yesterday that affected an extremely small number of supporters. The problem was fixed immediately and we are contacting those who were affected, she said in a statement. She provided no further details.  The NRSC, a party operation dedicated to getting Republicans elected to the Senate, said it found no evidence that its primary donation system was hacked. The numbers affected account for less than 0.0018 percent of online donations to the NRSC, a committee aide said. The committee had received more than $65 million in political contributions for the 2016 campaign, as of Aug. 31, according to Federal Election Commission records.      Researcher De Groot documented the attack in a video on his blog, in which he demonstrates that entering an order on the NRSC site causes the malware to send its details to a server in Russia. bit.ly/2dxNS6z The malware was embedded into the sites code, which can be viewed using a common web browser, according to de Groot.  A search of archived versions of the set led him to determine that it had been infected since at least March of this year, he said.  The infection was earlier reported by the Dutch website Follow the Money, www.ftm.nl.      ",politicsNews,"October 6, 2016 ",1
A Trump loss would 'upset the verdict of history': Allan Lichtman," (Corrects this Oct. 5 storys headline to conform with quote from professor that a Trump defeat would upset the verdict of history.) (Reuters) - The forces influencing the U.S. presidential election favor Republican nominee Donald Trump to win the popular vote - but even proven prediction models face the most difficult election by far to predict accurately, a political forecaster with a three-decade winning streak said on Wednesday. History Professor Allan Lichtman of American University in Washington has accurately predicted the popular result in presidential elections since Republican President Ronald Reagan defeated Democratic challenger Walter Mondale in 1984. Although the number of ballots cast by voters for each candidate counts, it does not ultimately determine who takes the White House. In a process known as the Electoral College, the candidate who wins a majority of 538 electoral votes is the victor. Each state and the District of Columbia is allocated a certain number of those votes, and the candidates have to amass them state-by-state on Election Day. While Lichtmans Keys to the White House analysis predicts a popular victory by Trump, some other models, such as FiveThirtyEights and The New York Times, have given Democratic rival Hillary Clinton a large probability of victory. Lichtman joined Reuters Global Markets Forum to discuss his take on Campaign 2016. What follows are excerpts from that conversation. Question: Why is Trump your favorite to win? Answer: With respect to my prediction, my Keys system is based on 13 true/false questions where an answer of true favors re-election of the White House party - the Democrats. They have exactly six false keys against them, just enough to predict their defeat. However, I also noted that Donald Trump is such a dangerously precedent-breaking candidate that he could upset the verdict of history and snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The two candidates have been repeatedly fact-checked by independent sources, and his lies vastly outnumber hers. Q: How big is the immigration issue in deciding the election? A: I think immigration is a very important issue. America is a nation of immigrants and immigrants have been demeaned for more than two centuries, the French, the Irish, the Jews, the Asians, the Mexicans, and now the Muslims. The two candidates have fundamentally different approaches to dealing with the issue. Q: What is your expectation for the next two debates? A: Trump has got to convince voters that he has the temperament, knowledge, and background to be a dependable and effective leader. He can try to do that without losing his base, which will never abandon him. The first debate was definitely a lost opportunity (for Trump), which may be hard to regain for him. Obama lost the first debate (against Mitt Romney) in 2012, but voters still did not have as many doubts about him as they do about Trump. In terms of temperament, he could take a lesson from Pence, but Trump has a great deal of difficulty preparing for a debate or keeping himself under control. ",politicsNews,"October 5, 2016 ",1
Trump backs off praise of Russia's Putin after debate,"HENDERSON, Nev. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump backed off from praising Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, saying he was unsure of his relationship with the Russian president who he has described as a better leader than President Barack Obama. The day after running mate Mike Pence appeared to break ranks with Trump during a vice presidential debate and called Putin a small and bullying leader, Trump adjusted his own previously warm rhetoric toward the Russian. I dont love (Putin), I dont hate. Well see how it works. Well see, Trump told supporters during a campaign stop in the swing state of Nevada. Maybe well have a good relationship. Maybe well have a horrible relationship. Maybe well have a relationship right in the middle. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has criticized Trump, who often praises Putin, as being too cozy with the Russian leader and questioned the Republicans business interests in Russia. Those charges were repeated by her vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine during a debate with Pence on Tuesday. In response, Pence denounced Putin for his interference in Syrias civil war and support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States, Pence said. The greatest nation on earth just withdraws from talks about a ceasefire, while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria. The vice presidential encounter set the table for a second presidential debate on Sunday in St. Louis between Clinton and Trump, who needs to rebound from a rocky performance in his first debate, one that gave Clinton a boost in national opinion polls with the Nov. 8 Election Day only five weeks away.         In Nevada, Trump suggested Russia could be a valuable ally in the fight against Islamic State, also known by the acronym  ISIS. I will say if we get along with Russia and Russia went out with us and knocked the hell out of ISIS, thats okay with me, folks, he said. Trump celebrated a strong debate performance by Pence, the governor of Indiana, and said his running mate had won on style and on the issues. Hes getting tremendous reviews from me and everybody, Trump told a group of pastors and leaders gathered at a Christian academy in Las Vegas. The encounter between Pence and Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia, was the only such debate between the vice presidential contenders, and the two spent most of their time attacking each others running mates. For more than 90 minutes at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, Pence sought to project an image as a reassuring presence, in contrast with the bombastic Trump, while Kaine tried to frighten voters away from Trump and make Clinton seem more trustworthy. A CNN/ORC snap poll declared Pence the winner with 48 percent support, compared with 42 percent for Kaine, who frequently interrupted his opponent. The television audience for the debate was 35.6 million viewers, according to preliminary data, about half the number who watched the first encounter between Trump and Clinton.     Republican strategists said Pences strong debate performance could provide lessons for Trump on how to approach the second debate - if he was willing or able to learn. Trump should hopefully learn a lesson - dont get angry, dont lose your cool, answer the question you want to answer, Republican strategist John Feehery said. The biggest thing is to not get rattled and be able to smile when you are attacked. Clinton met with advisers at her Washington, D.C., home on Wednesday and did not appear on the campaign trail. An aide said she spoke by phone with Kaine and congratulated him on his debate performance. Mike Pence didnt want to defend Donald Trump, and as Senator Kaine said, if you cant defend the person at the top of the ticket, how can you ask people to vote for you, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta told reporters outside her house.

Obama says protectionism no answer to inequalities of globalization,"(Reuters) - America must work with all nations to build stronger economies, recognizing the inequalities that globalization can generate but refusing to give in to protectionism, U.S. President Barack Obama wrote in the Economist on Thursday. Months before he leaves the White House in January, Obama wrote that a certain anxiety over globalization had taken hold in the United States, not unlike the discontent leading to Britains vote in June to leave the European Union.  The world is more prosperous than ever before and yet our societies are marked by uncertainty and unease, the Democratic president wrote. So we have a choice - retreat into old, closed-off economies or press forward, acknowledging the inequality that can come with globalization while committing ourselves to making the global economy work better for all people, not just those at the top. Calling capitalism the greatest driver of prosperity the world has ever known, Obama argued that trade had helped the U.S. economy much more than hurt it. His enthusiastic advocacy for trade runs counter to the stated policies of both his potential successors, who say many trade deals hurt U.S. workers. The Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal championed by the president is opposed by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his Democratic rival in the Nov. 8 election, Hillary Clinton, whom Obama has endorsed. Obama listed four major structural challenges facing the United States - boosting productivity growth, combating rising inequality, ensuring that everyone who wants a job can get one and building a resilient economy thats primed for future growth. Trumpeting the achievements of his eight-year presidency, led by preventing the 2007-2009 recession from turning into a depression, Obama said a foundation was laid for a better future. America must stay committed to working with all nations to build stronger and more prosperous economies for all our citizens for generations to come, he wrote. ",politicsNews,"October 6, 2016 ",1
"Next U.S. president, Putin's fourth, inherits sinking Russia ties","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Confronted by Russia in Syria, Ukraine and cyberspace, the next U.S. president will be the fourth to face Vladimir Putin and the challenge of deterring a Kremlin often more willing than the White House to take risk and project power. Over the last four years, the Russian president has annexed Crimea and destabilized eastern Ukraine, stymied U.S. hopes to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and mounted cyber attacks that U.S. officials blame on hackers commanded or orchestrated by Russian intelligence agencies. In his latest gambit, Putin this week suspended a treaty with Washington on cleaning up weapons-grade plutonium. While the United States has imposed economic sanctions on Russia for its actions in Ukraine, these have yet to force it to calm tensions in eastern Ukraine, let alone surrender Crimea. Some current and former U.S. officials argue the White House has failed to understand Putins bitterness about the decade after the Soviet Union collapsed, at a time the Russian leader feels the West took advantage of Russia when it was down. Further, they say the United States has little influence over the course of democracy in Russia, or on its willingness to use force in Syria, Ukraine or elsewhere to achieve its ends. The result, critics say, could be that Syria festers, Ukraine stays off balance and unable to draw closer to Europe, and that even areas such as arms control and nonproliferation, pillars of cooperation during the Cold War, could deteriorate. For Putin and most of the Russian leadership, its a zero-sum world, said Andrew Weiss of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank. Weiss argued the Russian leader was unlikely to change his stripes before Russias 2018 presidential election in an atmosphere where Putins own domestic political fortunes depend on having this external enemy, namely the United States.  A U.S. official suggested Putin, who has yet to tip his hand but is expected to run again, is willing to use force to get his way while the White House, scarred by the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is not. The administration never understood how bruised Putin and many, many Russians feel about the 1990s, or how determined they are to regain what they consider Russias rightful place in the world, much less what Putin is willing to do to get there, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  He will keep pushing until he meets serious resistance, and so far he hasnt, the official added. In the eyes of many current and former U.S. officials, Syria is a case in point. The United States this week announced it was suspending  talks with Russia on a ceasefire, all but saying the Russian and Syrian assault on Aleppo had made a mockery of the peace effort. Where they make a desert, they call it peace, Secretary of State John Kerry said, quoting the Roman historian Tacitus. Analysts believe Aleppo is likely to fall but the war, now in its sixth year, will grind on with Assad surviving atop a shrunken, broken and fragmented country enduring the worlds worst refugee crisis since World War Two. U.S. officials say the White House has yet to decide what to do next on Syria but few expect Obama to shift strategy in his waning months in office. It is not considering imposing further sanctions on Russia for now, two U.S. officials said. On Monday, Putin suspended a treaty with Washington on cleaning up weapons-grade plutonium, signaling he is willing to use nuclear disarmament as a new bargaining chip in disputes with the United States. If the relationship worsens, either side could be looking to exert leverage or score points in the nuclear arms control realm, said Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association. Another area where the United States is weighing its options is the stealthy war in cyberspace that is already under way with Russia and could escalate as relations worsen. U.S. officials anonymously say Russian intelligence services have interfered in the U.S. election process by launching cyber intrusions into the presidential campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and other U.S. political organizations and state election offices. The Kremlin denies the allegations. The White House has refrained from publicly accusing Russia. If hard evidence of Russias involvement emerges, Washington has a dilemma in fashioning a response because, by going public, it could tip Moscow to its own intrusions, prompting retaliation. Two U.S. officials suggested critics are taking too short term a view, arguing it can take years to achieve an objective, such as the liberation of the Baltic states from Soviet rule. Cold War-like policies, such as using economic sanctions to weaken Russias economy or deploying NATO troops to the Baltics and Poland in January to deter Russia, may work over time. Theres no quick fix with the Russians, said one official. ",politicsNews,"October 6, 2016 ",1
U.S. vice presidential debate watched by 37 million on TV,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - An estimated 37 million Americans watched the U.S. vice presidential debate between Republican Mike Pence and Democrat Tim Kaine on television, according to Nielsen data on Wednesday, less than half the number who tuned in to Donald Trumps first matchup with Hillary Clinton last week. The figure represented the average audience across nine channels during Tuesdays 90-minute encounter. Broadcaster NBC pulled in the biggest audience with 7 million viewers. Fox News Channel led cable networks with 6.1 million.   Last weeks first debate between the presidential candidates for the Nov. 8 election, Republican Trump and Democrat Clinton, was watched by a record 84 million TV viewers. Vice presidential debates have traditionally attracted smaller TV audiences, with the exception of the 2008 encounter between Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Sarah Palin, which set a record for a VP debate of 69.9 million viewers. The 2012 vice presidential encounter between Biden and Republican Paul Ryan was watched by 51.4 million Americans. None of the figures for the debates include those who watched online, through social media, or in bars and restaurants.  Tuesdays 90-minute face-off between Pence, governor of Indiana, and Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia, was the only debate between the vice presidential contenders before the election next month. NBC is a unit of Comcast Corp. Fox News Channel is owned by 21st Century Fox. ",politicsNews,"October 5, 2016 ",1

Ford chairman met with Trump over 'infuriating' Mexico comments,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (F.N) Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. said on Wednesday he has met with Donald Trump to talk about the Republican presidential candidates extensive criticism of the automakers investments in Mexico. Ford told the Economic Club of Washington that he thought Trumps criticism of the No. 2 automakers foreign investments were infuriating and frustrating because of the companys extensive investments and employment in the United States. Trump has threatened if elected to impose hefty tariffs on Ford imports from Mexico. Ford told reporters after the event that the session with Trump was a great meeting that took place a few months ago. He was very thoughtful, asked good questions, Ford said of Trump. He certainly knows the facts. Asked if Trump had changed his mind about his criticism, Ford did not directly answer but said, The campaign trail is a different animal than anything Im ever familiar with. A person briefed on the matter said the meeting took place in New York this summer at the real estate moguls Trump Tower. The automaker had previously invited Trump to visit its headquarters at Dearborn, Michigan but he has not taken the company up on the offer. Ford rejected the criticism from Trump, noting that it employs more U.S. workers and builds more vehicles in the United States than its rivals. We should be celebrated I think in some ways as the great American car company, Ford said. We make more cars and trucks here than anyone else. Ford announced last month that all of the companys small-car production would be leaving U.S. plants and heading to lower-cost Mexico, drawing another rebuke from the White House hopeful.  Ford has repeatedly said no U.S. jobs will be lost because of the move  and it will produce two new vehicles at a Detroit area plant that built the small cars. Trump called Fords decision horrible. He has criticized Fords Mexican investments for more than a year and vowed to pressure the automaker to reverse course if elected. We shouldnt allow it to happen, Trump said. Trump has also repeatedly misstated Fords plans at times, wrongly suggesting last month Ford would fire all of their employees in the United States. Many major automakers have announced big expansions in Mexico, where labor rates are much lower than what U.S. workers make. A spokeswoman for Trump did not immediately comment. Last year, Ford said that chief executive Mark Fields had written to Trump to explain its investments in Mexico. ",politicsNews,"October 5, 2016 ",1
Commentary: Manic or evasive - these veep guys sure don’t feel like leaders,"After going through a week reminiscent of Napoleons at Waterloo, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will likely claim that Indiana Governor Mike Pences performance in Tuesdays vice-presidential debate gave a boost to their campaign.  That would be overstating it.  The debate probably changed few votes in the 2016 presidential election. The question is whether it will change any votes in the 2020 contest.  In this years race, the debate was something of a wash. Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, came across like an over-caffeinated prosecutorial chipmunk  interrupting at every occasion. And at moments that werent occasions at all.  A gentle soul whos uncomfortable in the attack-dog role that the Clinton campaign has assigned him, Kaine plainly overcompensated by piping up whenever Pence sought to evade debate moderator Elaine Quijanos questions.  And because Pence spent the evening evading, Kaine spent the evening interrupting. Though at the start, the interruptions actually preceded the evasions, and often interrupted Quijanos interjections as well.  Pence surely had the better podium manner (no great achievement), even if his response to all Kaines and Quijanos questions about the true man of the hour  Trump  was to change the subject. Or, if pressed, to deny that Trump had said what, in fact, Trump had said.  When the 10-second clips are aired and re-aired, Kaines attacks on Trump and Pences non-responses will redound mildly to Clintons advantage.  But what does the debate tell us about the future of both parties? Pence was surely playing to the GOPs religious right on Tuesday, with his anti-choice religiosity.  In that sense, he was trying to supplant Texas Senator Ted Cruz as the Holy Rollers favorite son in the 2020 Republican primaries. (Im assuming, of course, that Trump will not be running for his second term.)  Pence would bring some clear advantages to this contest. Unlike Cruz, Pence didnt desert the partys nominee (though Cruz came slinking back last week and finally endorsed Trump). Pence hasnt waged a scorched-earth war against the Republican leadership. He doesnt bear a disquieting resemblance to Bela Lugosi. For all these reasons, Pence will likely be the religious rights candidate to take on President Hillary Clinton in 2020.  Should Pence become the nominee, however, the GOP standard-bearer would likely only widen the already-yawning gap between Republicans and a majority of the American electorate. The affirmation of traditional right-wing positions that Pence delivered last night  against progressive taxation and all regulation, against a womans right to choose  would yield the party precious little support among millennials, who will be by far the largest age group in the 2020 electorate.  As for Kaine, its hard to think of any wing of the Democratic Party that would flock to him as a future standard bearer after last nights gravitas-free performance. Its increasingly unclear why Clinton chose him to be her running mate, because that apparently meant miscasting him as her surrogate Trump-attacker.  In both his convention speech and his debate performance, Kaine has shown himself not up to the task. Some alternatives to Kaine  Labor Secretary Tom Perez comes to mind  would clearly have been better suited to the role. Perez would also have been better suited to help Clinton win more support from the one constituency that she most needs to do better: millennials. Many still dont see Clinton as signifying any change or embodying the values that Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders championed.  Kaine is a man of many virtues, and certainly could step into the presidency if he had to. But as a candidate and as a politician able to speak to younger voters and the Sanderistas  that is, the future of the Democratic Party  hes been distinctly underwhelming.  Meanwhile, Quijano jumped around, one topic to another, almost as manically as Kaine. Moderating is no easy job, but it must be said that Quijano shaped an uncommonly disjointed evening.  More important,, both her questions on the economy  still the American publics No. 1 concern  focused on the debt and balancing the budget. At a time when the disabling effects of economic inequality and the need for greater public investment in infrastructure are belatedly receiving the recognition they deserve  and when the candidates differences on these and other economic issues are vast  the size of the debt was hardly the topic on which the public needed to hear from the candidates.  Between Quijanos topic-hopping, Kaines interruptions and Pences evasions, the debate flashed by as cacophonously and at times as incomprehensibly as a game of pinball.  Despite all the clamor, it was resoundingly clear by evenings end that Kaine is not the Democrats future leader, and Pence, while he could be the Republicans, is not likely to be Americas.

Florida's Puerto Ricans strongly favor Clinton: poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Floridas rapidly growing Puerto Rican population heavily favors Democrat Hillary Clinton over Republican Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential race, according to a poll released on Wednesday by groups with links to the Democrats.  Seventy-four percent of Puerto Ricans now registered to vote in Florida said they would likely pick Clinton in the Nov. 8 election, versus 17 percent for Trump, according to the poll from the Center for American Progress Action Fund and Latino Decisions. Puerto Ricans, who traditionally lean toward voting Democratic in Florida, are a big enough group to swing the closely-fought state. Florida, the third-largest state in the country in terms of electoral college votes needed to win the White House, has seen an influx of people from Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, as the Caribbean islands economy has floundered in recent years.  More than one million Puerto Ricans now live in Florida, according to the Pew Research Center, making up about 5 percent of the total population. The Center for American Progress Action Fund is a progressive non-partisan organization that has been critical of Trump in the past. Latino Decisions has consulted for the Clinton campaign.        Florida is currently too close to call between Clinton and Trump, according to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project, and both candidates have been focusing their campaigns there heading into the election. Trump angered many Hispanics when he launched his campaign last year by calling some Mexican immigrants rapists and drug dealers, and his hardline immigration policies have done little to attract Latino voters. The poll did not gauge the level of eligible Puerto Rican voters who have registered in Florida, an important measure given historically low Latino turnout. Latino voter registration lagged white and African-American voters in the 2014 congressional elections by 12 to 15 percentage points nationally, according to the U.S. Census. But it said Puerto Rican voters now registered in Florida appeared motivated. Some 84 percent said they would definitely vote, with another 14 percent saying they would probably do so. Only 2 percent said they definitely would not. The poll included 504 registered Puerto Rican voters in Florida with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. It was conducted from Sept. 17 to Sept. 26. ",politicsNews,"October 5, 2016 ",1

Exclusive: Wells Fargo account scandal extends to small business - U.S. senator,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The scandal over improper sales practices at Wells Fargo & Co extended to thousands of small-business owners, according to a U.S. lawmaker, raising questions about the scope of the banks issues with unauthorized accounts. In a Sept. 29 letter viewed by Reuters on Tuesday, Sen. David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, demanded that Wells Fargo Chief Executive John Stumpf provide a full accounting of customers affected. Vitter is a member of the U.S. Senates banking committee and also heads its small business committee. Discussions between congressional staffers and Wells Fargo have indicated that the fraudulent activity of your employees was not limited to Wells Fargos consumer banking operations, Vitter wrote. Thousands of small business owners were impacted by this fraud. A person familiar with Vitters probe say Wells has identified about 10,000 small business accounts that were subject to improper practices. Vitter spokeswoman Cheyenne Klotz declined to comment on specifics about those practices. Revelations of Wells Fargos problems with small-business customers come almost a month after it reached a $190 million settlement over opening as many as 2 million accounts in retail customers names without their knowledge. The bank has said it fired about 5,300 employees for improperly opening the accounts. The disclosures have caused a public furor, with Stumpf facing heated questions before two congressional committees and other U.S. authorities launching investigations into the banks sales practices, including the Justice Department and the Labor Department. While the vast majority of accounts in the settlement were consumer accounts, to the extent there were small business accounts included, all were previously reported in the total number of potentially impacted accounts, said Wells spokeswoman Jennifer Langan. As stated earlier, Wells Fargo has already refunded 115,000 accounts. The impacted accounts, including Small Business, were part of our Retail Bank business. A Consumer Financial Protection Board spokesman contradicted the Wells statement, however, saying its figure of nearly 2 million accounts being affected did not include small business accounts. Wells is also battling lawsuits from former employees, customers and shareholders related to the issue. In a second letter, Vitter requested that the Small Business Administrations inspector general, Peggy Gustafson, investigate Wells, too. Senior bank executives have apologized for opening accounts customers did not request, but characterized the issue as limited to relatively few customers and employees in the retail bank. Early results from Vitters examination are the first hard sign that problems may extend further. Reuters also spoke to a former Wells employee, and a lawyer representing former employees and a former and current Wells customer, who described abusive sales practices with multiple business accounts.     Jose Maldonado, a restaurant owner in Southern California who banked with Wells Fargo for 15 years, said he discovered seven accounts after enlisting the help of his accountant. He initially closed extraneous ones, and ultimately moved his remaining business to Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co. I dont like Wells Fargo anymore. I dont feel comfortable, Maldonado said in an interview. In the past, there were sometimes crazy accounts without my permission. Langan declined to comment on Maldonados accounts. An ex-Wells Fargo business banker, who declined to be identified, said employees at his former branch were required to sell products to small business customers such as hair-salon owners and carpet cleaners in packages of three - regardless of whether they needed them. Those typically included accounts for checking, credit card processing and payroll, and were often linked to additional savings accounts, said the former Wells banker. Bankers also tacked on business credit cards and were pressured to call a Wells insurance unit, with the customer present, to push business liability policies.    Langan, the Wells spokeswoman, said the bank discontinued those packages in April 2015. Attorney Jonathan Delshad filed two class-action lawsuits against Wells Fargo in September on behalf of former employees, including one business banker, who say they were fired for refusing to create fake accounts to hit sales quotas. Wells suspended those quotas on Oct. 1. Other former Wells Fargo business bankers contacted Delshad after the lawsuit received media attention, he said. Business owners are also being ripped off, one wrote to him in a message he provided to Reuters. Business and corporate governance experts say small-business customers can be as susceptible to fraud as any customer.  Owners are typically knowledgeable about their business expertise but not about banking services, said Peter Conti-Brown, a financial regulation professor at the University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School. For example, a new dentist who borrows from a bank to buy a practice may then need other services that she does not even know exist, such as payroll management or credit-card clearing. But the potential for abuse still exists, he said. A bank can sell multiple, unnecessary accounts and credit cards to sole proprietors whose needs rarely exceed making deposits and writing checks. The risk of abuse is greater when bankers are required to sell a certain number of products to meet performance goals. The best case is that you will sour your relationship, and in the worst case, youll get bankers committing fraud, Conti-Brown said. Wells Fargo has seen both of these things.

Clinton hits Trump over comments on women ahead of vice presidential debate,"HAVERFORD, Pa. (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton slammed Republican Donald Trump on Tuesday for making disparaging comments about womens physical appearance, accusing Trump of taking the issue of female body image to a new level of difficulty and meanness. Hours before vice presidential candidates Tim Kaine and Mike Pence face off in Virginia in their sole debate, Clinton urged women at an event in the Philadelphia suburbs billed as a family town hall to stand up to online bullying about how they look. Its shocking when women are called names and judged solely on the basis of physical attributes, the Democratic presidential nominee said in response to a 15-year-old girls question about the problem of body image and the damage Donald Trump does when he talks about how women look. My opponent insulted Miss Universe, Clinton said, resurrecting her Republican rivals comments last week about former beauty queen Alicia Machados weight gain after she won the Miss Universe contest in 1996. I mean, how do you get more acclaimed than that? But it wasnt good enough, Clinton said. We cant take any of this seriously anymore. We need to laugh at it. We need to refute it. Clinton, the first woman to be nominated for the presidency by a major U.S. party, has rushed to capitalize on Trumps public feud with Machado, whom he once called Miss Piggy because of her weight gain, and make inroads with women voters five weeks before the Nov. 8 election. Clintons and Trumps running mates, Democrat Kaine, a U.S. senator, and Republican Pence, governor of Indiana, will meet in a debate in Farmville, Virginia, starting at 9 p.m. on Tuesday (0100 GMT on Wednesday.)  The debate will provide voters their first extended chance to evaluate the No. 2s in the White House race and is the only showdown between the vice presidential candidates. Trump and Clinton will meet in their second debate on Sunday. Pence could find himself frequently on the defensive about Trump, a New York businessman who has been dealing with a torrent of bad news in the past week. That includes a New York Times report that Trump took an almost $1 billion loss in 1995 that may have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years. While Democrats have slammed him over the report, Trump, who made much of his business acumen on the campaign trail, has said he brilliantly used U.S. tax rules to his advantage to limit his tax bills. Clinton disagreed, telling reporters on Tuesday it showed unequivocally that Trump was a failure at business for losing $1 billion to begin with. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday said 67 percent of Americans believed it was selfish for a presidential candidate to pay no taxes, although 46 percent thought a candidate who paid no taxes was smart. Clinton also criticized Trump for appearing to suggest on Monday that veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress were not strong enough to handle the stress of war. Trump and his campaign said his words were taken out of context. When people come back from war and combat, and they see things that maybe a lot of folks in this room have seen many times over - and youre strong and you can handle it - but a lot of people cant handle it, Trump told a veterans group on Monday. Clinton said troops deserved a commander in chief who understood their sacrifice. Donald Trumps comments are not just ignorant, they are harmful because they give voice to the stigma that has led generations of veterans to hide their struggles instead of getting lifesaving help, she said. On the campaign trail on Tuesday, Trump met with about a dozen energy executives in Denver, querying them mainly about their concerns about regulations he said had gotten out of control. John Harpole, chief executive of Mercator Energy, said he did not understand why the Obama administrations response to the shale boom and Clintons energy positions had not come up during the first presidential debate last week. Others told Trump they faced more immediate concerns with state-level regulators. Scott Stewart of Gilbert-Stewart Operating said his company had largely moved operations to Kansas because of stiff rules in Colorado. Trump also reveled in comments on Monday by Clintons husband, former President Bill Clinton, who said small-business people and people who make too much to get federal subsidies to help with insurance payments were getting killed by the federal healthcare law known as Obamacare. Trump has promised to repeal Obamacare, while Hillary Clinton has praised it but said she would work to improve aspects of it. I bet he went through hell last night, can you imagine? Trump said of Bill Clinton during a rally in Prescott, Arizona. He went through hell, but honestly there have been many nights when he has gone through hell with Hillary. Clinton has led Trump in national opinion polls in recent months. On Tuesday, an average of polls aggregated by RealClearPolitics website showed her with 48.1 percent of support compared with Trumps 44.3 percent. ",politicsNews,"October 5, 2016 ",1
Same-day voter registration temporarily reinstated in Illinois,"(Reuters) - An Illinois law allowing voters in highly populated areas to register to vote at polling places on election day was reinstated on Tuesday by a federal court, pending an appeal of a ruling declaring the statute unfair to people in smaller communities. The state is seeking to overturn a ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Samuel Der-Yeghiayan, which found that the law discriminates against voters in less-populated counties. The law, passed in late 2014 by the Democratic-led legislature and signed into law in early 2015 by former Democratic Governor Pat Quinn, allowed election day voter registration for the first time, including at polling places. But the section of the law regarding polling place registration pertained only to counties with populations of 100,000 or more. The conservative Liberty Justice Center, of Chicago, filed a lawsuit in August, saying the law was discriminatory. Der-Yeghiayan agreed, writing that the law provided an advantage to urban voters over their rural counterparts.  The state of Illinois appealed the ruling last month, and in their order issued Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit granted the states request to stay the order until the appeal was adjudicated, court records show. U.S. voters will go to the polls to choose a president, Congressional representatives and other officials on Nov. 8. On Tuesday, the appellate court ordered attorneys on both sides to say by Thursday whether they would like the appeals process to be sped up due to the proximity of the election.

Proposed U.S. anti-inversion rules enter final review,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulations, proposed by the Treasury to crack down on companies that try to reduce taxes by rebasing abroad, have begun a White House review and could be finalized shortly, officials said on Tuesday. The regulations, which would make it difficult for U.S. business operations to avoid taxation while shifting profits overseas through a practice called earnings stripping, were received by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) last week. The agency has up to 90 days to decide whether the rules should be finalized or returned to Treasury for further consideration. We are satisfied we have addressed stakeholder feedback and are close to issuing final earnings stripping regulations, a Treasury spokesperson said. The Obama administration has faced widespread criticism from the business community over its regulatory assault on tax inversions, which are tax-driven mergers in which a U.S. company acquires a smaller, foreign business in a low-tax country and shifts its headquarters there, if only on paper, to avoid higher U.S. taxes.    Business and industry groups have threatened lawsuits and called for the new rules to be withdrawn or heavily revised because of what critics say is the potential for unintended harm to business. Members of Congress have also accused the administration of overstepping its legal authority. Earnings stripping occurs when an inverted company eludes U.S. taxes on its domestic operation by shifting profits overseas in the form of tax-deductible interest payments to its foreign parent. The new rules would change certain interest payments into equity dividends, which are not tax deductible in the United States.  The regulations were proposed in April, along with a temporary rule to prevent serial inversion deals by foreign companies. That rule, which is already the target of a lawsuit, has not yet been forwarded to OMB. ",politicsNews,"October 4, 2016 ",1
"Trump calls tax avoidance 'smart,' most Americans call it 'unpatriotic': poll","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says paying no income tax would make him smart. While nearly half of Americans agree with him, more people think it is selfish, and unpatriotic, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday.  Some 67 percent of Americans said it is selfish for a presidential candidate to pay no taxes, while 61 percent said it is unpatriotic, according to the poll, which allowed respondents to pick more than one adjective to describe paying no taxes. At the same time, the results showed some respect for a candidate who can figure out how to reduce their tax bill. Some 46 percent of Americans, including 35 percent of Democrats and 62 percent of Republicans, thought a presidential candidate who pays no taxes is smart. Trumps taxes have become a big campaign issue after the New York Times released a portion of his 1995 tax returns last week and estimated that Trump likely paid no taxes for a number of years. The celebrity real estate developer, who is the first presidential candidate in decades to refuse to release his full tax returns, didnt deny the report. He later said that he had brilliantly used U.S. tax rules to his advantage.  During the first presidential debate with his rival Democrat Hillary Clinton last month, Trump responded to Clintons allegation that he paid no federal taxes by saying that would make him smart.  What is he trying to say: that those of us who pay taxes arent intelligent? said poll respondent Yonna McNerney, 41, of Denver. I started working at the age of 16, and Ive always paid taxes, she said. Not paying taxes, I dont think thats acceptable. McNerney, a mother of three who works at a telecommunications company, remains uncommitted in the race and said Trumps comments about taxes havent changed her mind one way or the other. April St. Aoro, 46, who works for a manufacturing firm near St. Cloud, Minnesota, was more understanding of Trumps point of view, though she also remains undecided in the race. I think all of us are trying to pay as little taxes as possible, St. Aoro said. Respondents were slightly less critical when asked to describe a private citizen paying no taxes. Some 64 percent agreed it was selfish, while just over half agreed it was unpatriotic. Some 50 percent, including 37 percent of Democrats and 67 percent of Republicans, agreed that it was smart. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. Respondents were asked what they thought of a private citizen who has found a way to pay no income taxes, and given the choice to agree or disagree to the words smart, selfish, and unpatriotic.  They were then asked the same set of questions about a presidential candidate. The Sept. 28-Oct. 3 poll was part of a larger national tracking poll that tracks public opinion every day. It included 1,948 American adults, including 893 Democrats and 635 Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire sample, 4 percentage points for Democrats only and 5 percentage points for Republicans.

Trump says he 'brilliantly' used U.S. tax laws,"PUEBLO, Colo. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Monday he brilliantly used U.S. tax rules to his advantage in trying to limit the amount he paid in taxes, arguing it helped him survive a difficult period in the real estate market. I was able to use the tax laws of this country and my business acumen to dig out of the real estate mess ... when few others were able to do what I did, Trump told a crowd in Pueblo, Colorado. It was Trumps first extended comments since a New York Times report said he had claimed a $916 million loss on his 1995 tax returns, which experts said might have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for 18 years.  Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 election, has seized on the report, arguing the tax records undercut Trumps business acumen.  What kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year? This is Trump to a T, hes taken corporate excess and made a business out of it, Clinton told a rally in Toledo, Ohio, on Monday. Clinton has repeatedly called on Trump to release his full returns, as presidential candidates have done in the past.  Trump was dismissive of the Times story in his Pueblo remarks, saying the media was obsessed with an alleged tax filing from the 1990s. The Trump campaign has not said, however, that the Times story was inaccurate. Instead, his supporters, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie have contended that Trumps aggressive use of provisions under U.S. law to minimize his tax liability was evidence of his genius as a businessman and real estate investor. Trump picked up on that theme on Monday. I have brilliantly used those laws, he told the crowd in Pueblo. The flap over Trumps taxes comes during what has been a difficult stretch for the candidate, who faced criticism for his performance in the Sept. 26 debate against Clinton and his subsequent public spat with former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. A Reuters/Ipsos online poll last week showed a majority of Americans felt Clinton won the debate, the first of three scheduled between the candidates.. On Monday, the state of New York ordered Trumps charity, the Trump Foundation, to suspend raising money amid a probe into its activities. ",politicsNews,"October 3, 2016 ",1
Canada could make some gains if NAFTA reopened: negotiators,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada, fearful of talk by the U.S. presidential candidates to  reopen the North American Free Trade Agreement, could use the opportunity to push for a better deal on worker mobility, dispute resolutions and other issues, Canadian negotiators of the original pact said. Republican Donald Trump calls NAFTA the worst trade deal signed by the United States and Democrat Hillary Clinton has signaled a change of position on the 1994 pact she supported when it became law under her husband, former president Bill Clinton. The agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico is often used for political grist in U.S. election campaigns but altering it is a major concern for export-oriented Canada. In 2008, Barack Obama campaigned on renegotiating the treaty with tougher labor and environmental standards, a pledge that fell to the wayside when he became president in January 2009. But the idea has taken hold more strongly in 2016 and Mexico has said it is ready to update the treaty. Canada has said NAFTA is in the best interest of all three countries. If Canada were forced to renegotiate, one issue it could target is the pacts investor-state dispute settlement provision. The United States wanted it included in the original deal to protect U.S. investments in Mexico. It has since been used by American companies to sue Canadian federal and provincial governments. TransCanada Corp is using the provision to seek billions from the U.S. government for rejecting the Keystone XL pipeline. That would probably be an area of mutual concern for Canada and the United States given those unintended consequences, said Derek Burney, Canadas former U.S. ambassador, who was involved in the original negotiations. Labor mobility, a concern for Canadian technology companies, could be improved by updating the list of professions that allows workers to relocate between countries. We fell short in terms of what we wanted to achieve on labor mobility in the NAFTA, said John Weekes, Canadas chief negotiator, who added Canada should also push for improved access to the U.S. government procurement market. Reopening NAFTA could give the Canadian government cover to phase out a domestic supply management system for the politically powerful dairy industry that has come under international criticism, negotiators said. Id be secretly delighted if they came hard at us on supply management, said Burney. Given the dairy industry and its weight in the United States, its not easy to dismiss. The system controls dairy prices and production, which critics say drives up consumers prices. The industry says it allows farmers to get stable prices, and noted Canada has preserved the system while negotiating several trade agreements. Still, former negotiators warned Canada would not be working from a position of strength as it sought concessions. Ignoring everything else, yes, there could be an opportunity there, said Michael Hart, who advised on the original negotiations. But in the real world, Id be very cautious. While Clinton has said she would rework the trade pact, Trumps threat to withdraw is a bigger concern in Canada. If were in a situation where people are threatening theyre going to walk out of trade agreements unless they can be renegotiated, then I think were in a situation where it would be very difficult, said Weekes.

Oklahoma Supreme Court strikes down restrictive abortion law,"(Reuters) - Oklahomas highest court on Tuesday struck down a law imposing restrictions on abortion providers, including a requirement that they take samples of fetal tissue from patients younger than 14 and preserve them for state investigators. The law also set new criminal penalties for providers who violate abortion-related statutes as well as individuals who help a minor evade the requirement to obtain parental consent. In addition, the bill created a new, stricter inspection system for abortion clinics. Legislators had said the fetal tissue section was aimed at capturing child rapists and that the law would protect womens health. But the New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights, which challenged the law in court, said it unfairly targeted facilities that perform abortions. In a unanimous opinion, the nine-member Oklahoma Supreme Court found the law violated the state constitutions requirement that each legislative bill must address only one subject.  The rule, the court said, is designed to prevent legislators from including provisions that would not normally pass in otherwise popular bills. The state unsuccessfully asserted that each part of the law addressed a single subject: womens reproductive health. We reject defendants arguments and find this legislation violates the single subject rule as each of these sections is so unrelated and misleading that a legislator voting on this matter could have been left with an unpalatable all-or-nothing choice, Justice Joseph Watt wrote for the court. In a concurring opinion, four judges said they also would have struck down the law as an unconstitutional burden on a womans right to have an abortion. Lincoln Ferguson, a spokesman for the Oklahoma Attorney Generals Office, called the decision disappointing. This law would have given law enforcement the ability to more easily prosecute sexual assaults of children that are discovered when a child under 14 has an abortion, he said.  The Attorney Generals Office remains committed to defending laws aimed at protecting the safety and well-being of Oklahoma women. In a statement, Center for Reproductive Rights President Nancy Northup said the law was nothing but a cynical attack on womens health and rights by unjustly targeting their trusted health care providers. Oklahomas Republican-dominated government has joined several socially conservative states in enacting abortion restrictions in recent years, drawing court challenges. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Texas law imposing strict regulations on facilities that perform abortions. A similar law is on hold in Oklahoma while the state Supreme Court considers its legality. ",politicsNews,"October 4, 2016 ",1
"Elections over, Brazil tackles unpopular spending reforms","BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temers government introduced to Congress on Tuesday a landmark constitutional amendment to cap public spending, seeking to press ahead with unpopular reforms in the wake of last weekends municipal elections. Temers new center-right government hopes the proposal, which would limit growth in spending to the rate of inflation for up to 20 years, will clear a Congressional committee this week and be put to a vote in the lower house by next week. The amendment is designed to curb a budget deficit equivalent to 10 percent of gross domestic product last year. Hopes for its passage have made Brazilian assets among the best performing in the world this year despite an economy submerged in a two-year recession. In a concession to ease its passage, the government announced on Monday that a cap on health and education expenditure would not go into effect until 2018, rather than next year. Leftist opponents have demanded more time to debate a measure they say violates the spirit of Brazils 1988 constitution, which made generous provisions for social spending. They plan to seek a court injunction to block the amendment. Backers warn that Latin Americas largest nation, which is wrestling with a sprawling corruption scandal, could follow Greeces path to financial meltdown if spending is not controlled. Temer said on Monday that public debt, which ended last year at a level equivalent to two-thirds of economic output, would reach 100 percent of GDP by 2024 without the measure. If this change is not adopted, fiscal collapse and the  insolvency of public accounts are inevitable, lawmaker Darcisio Perondi said in his report to the committee studying the measure. Brazil could repeat the tragedy of Greece.  Perondi said the previous government of Dilma Rousseff, who was removed from office in August for breaking budget laws, left an onerous legacy of overdrawn accounts, and he called on the lawmakers who impeached her to back the cap. The conclusion of municipal elections in most cities across Brazil last weekend allows Temers ruling Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) and its coalition allies a freer hand to back the measure. A small number of cities face a second-round runoff this month. But resistance from Rousseffs Workers Party and its allies, as well as division within Temers own coalition, point to a difficult path for a proposal that requires two approvals in each chamber of Congress by a three-fifths majority. We will seek an injunction because this violates the Constitution and the right of five future governments to decide their economic policies, said opposition leader Jandira Feghali of the Communist Party of Brazil. Temer, 75, who was sworn in to serve the remainder of Rousseffs term through 2018, had vowed to put Brazil back on its tracks and investors like his promises of fiscal discipline.  But a poll published on Tuesday showed Temer has failed to convince Brazilians that his government is any better than Rousseffs. The survey by pollster Ibope showed that Temers approval ratings remain low and some 68 percent of Brazilians do not trust him.  The lower House is also expected to vote on Tuesday on a bill that changes the rules for the exploration of Brazils vast offshore oil reserves in the costly subsalt layer, aimed at boosting private investment in the oil industry.  The proposal removes the obligation for scandal-plagued, debt-ridden state oil company Petrobras to be the only operator of these oil fields and have a minimum 30 percent stake in their development.

International observers will watch U.S. vote closely,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Amid charges from Donald Trump that the U.S. presidential election could be rigged and concerns of rights activists that black voters may face undue obstacles, the head of an international observer team pledged a full review ranging from voting machines to racial bias as it began work on Tuesday. The team from the 57-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) that will monitor the Nov. 8 presidential and Congressional elections is set to be the biggest the organization has sent to the United States, tasked with checking the vote meets international standards. Republican candidate Trumps apparent suggestion that the vote might not be free and fair has drawn an angry response from his opponents, who say it is baseless. Democrat Hillary Clinton has led Trump in national opinion polls in recent months. On Tuesday, an average of polls aggregated by RealClearPolitics website showed her with 48.1 percent of support compared to Trumps 44.3 percent.  Civil rights advocates have also said voters are more likely to face racial bias at this election than they have in 50 years, because of voting laws that several states passed after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down part of the landmark anti-discrimination 1965 Voting Rights Act three years ago. We do have concerns about voter registration, voter identification and also electronic voting, the head of the OSCE mission, British lawyer and diplomat Audrey Glover said in a telephone interview, adding that the mission is impartial. We always let the facts speak for themselves, so lets see what happens, she said. Allegations such as Trumps, however,  were for the U.S. authorities to follow up on while the OSCE observed, she added. Were not policemen. The Shelby County v Holder Supreme Court ruling in 2013 struck down a part of the Voting Rights Act that was used to determine which areas with a history of discrimination had to obtain special permission before changing their voting laws. That has raised concerns among rights groups that laws on issues like voter identification have since been changed to make it more difficult for poor and minority voters to take part. The OSCE, which comprises much of Europe, Central Asia and North America, has also suggested that all electronic voting machines be required by law to leave a verifiable paper trail, though many states do not provide one. Glover said her team would seek to clarify where it legally can and cannot go, adding that states and counties stance on international observers was often not clear. Texas also threatened OSCE observers with prosecution four years ago, which the organization called unacceptable at the time. Glover, however, struck a conciliatory tone. If the law says international observers are not allowed, then obviously we wont try and go. Were not going to try and make any sort of a scene, she told Reuters.  But the biggest hindrance might be self-inflicted. The OSCE had hoped to deploy 100 so-called long-term observers in the coming week, but OSCE states - including Germany, France, Spain, Romania, Finland, Bosnia - have only provided 26.  Up to 400 short-term observers will begin work close to Election Day. Well do what we can with what weve got, Glover said. We will try and make a silk purse out of a pigs ear and we will try and cover the whole of the United States, or to the extent that is feasible.  ",politicsNews,"October 4, 2016 ",1
U.S. justices skeptical of Puerto Rican politician's bribery appeal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared ready to rule against a Puerto Rican politician who maintained he cannot be retried on corruption charges involving a trip to Las Vegas to watch a boxing bout after his original conviction was thrown out. The eight justices heard the first oral argument of their new term in the appeal filed by Hector Martinez Maldonado, who served in Puerto Ricos Senate from 2005 until his 2011 conviction, and businessman Juan Bravo Fernandez, former president of a private security company. Several justices expressed skepticism about the defendants arguments. Bravo Fernandez sought to bribe Martinez Maldonado to win passage of bills that would benefit his business, according to prosecutors. The case focused in part on allegations that Bravo Fernandez paid for Martinez Maldonado to travel to Las Vegas in 2005 to watch boxer Felix Tito Trinidad, a sports hero in the Caribbean U.S. territory, lose to underdog Winky Wright. Bravo Fernandez and Martinez Maldonado were convicted for their roles in the alleged bribery scheme. The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out their convictions in 2013. Federal prosecutors planned a new trial but the two men said it should be barred because it would violate the U.S. Constitutions protection against double jeopardy, preventing people from being tried on charges for which they already have been acquitted. Their lawyers said double jeopardy applies because the jury had acquitted them on some of the criminal charges concerning conduct closely related to the actions on which the retrial would be focused. Prosecutors said the acquittals were inconsistent with the convictions, suggesting jurors did not understand the law. Based on the questions they asked, the justices appeared unlikely to throw out a 2015 appeals court decision backing prosecutors. Justice Elena Kagan asked the defendants attorney, Lisa Blatt, about her argument: Is it anything more than rhetoric? Chief Justice John Roberts told Blatt it was her burden to show the jurys verdict was a legal and valid judgment on the same set of facts that the government wants to re-try, and not just a misunderstanding. A ruling is due by the end of June. Outside the courthouse, protesters demanded that the U.S. Senate confirm Merrick Garland, President Barack Obamas nominee to fill the courts vacancy left by the February death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Senate Republicans have refused to act on Garlands nomination, saying Obamas successor should make the appointment after taking office in January. ",politicsNews,"October 4, 2016 ",1
"In new blow to campaign, Trump's foundation ordered to halt fundraising","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New Yorks attorney general ordered Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps charitable foundation to immediately stop fundraising in the state, warning that a failure to do so would be a continuing fraud. For Trump, the cease-and-desist order was the latest in a series of blows that has sent his campaign reeling. The New York businessman and his aides spent much of the weekend dealing with the fallout from a New York Times report that said Trump may have avoided paying federal income taxes for almost 20 years. New York Attorney General Eric Schneidermans office said the Donald J. Trump Foundation was violating a state law requiring charitable organizations that solicit outside donations to register with the offices Charities Bureau. The order followed a series of reports in The Washington Post that suggested improprieties by the foundation, including using its funds to settle legal disputes involving Trump businesses. The failure immediately to discontinue solicitation and to file information and reports required under Article 7-A with the Charities Bureau shall be deemed to be a continuing fraud upon the people of the state of New York, according to a letter dated on Friday that the office posted online on Monday. Trumps campaign has suggested that the probe launched by Schneiderman, a Democrat, was politically motivated. While again putting Trumps campaign on the defensive, the order could also undercut his efforts to make the Clinton Foundation, the family charity of Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton, a primary target in his campaign against her for the Nov. 8 election. Trump has sought to paint the Clinton Foundation as a pay-to-play operation under which the former U.S. secretary of state and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, rewarded big donors to the foundation with access. The Clinton Foundation, which has $354 million in assets and almost 500 staffers, is a radically different charitable vehicle from the small-scale Trump nonprofit. It has worked to reduce the cost of drugs for people with HIV in developing countries, eradicate childhood obesity in the United States and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There has been no evidence that foreign donors to the foundation obtained favors from the State Department while Clinton headed the agency. While some donors were able to obtain meetings with her or senior State Department officials, Clinton has said the fact that they had donated to the foundation did not play a role in her decision to meet with them. The scrutiny of the Trump Foundation came as the Republican candidate was dealing with a torrent of bad news, including his shaky performance in his first debate with Clinton on Sept. 26 and the release by the New York Times of tax records that showed Trump taking an almost $1 billion loss in 1995 that may have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years. In its series on the Trump Foundation, The Washington Post reported that Trump may have violated U.S. Internal Revenue Service rules against self-dealing by using foundation money to purchase two portraits of himself, which were then hung at his private golf clubs in New York and Florida. The newspaper also said that Trump may have improperly used the foundation to settle legal disputes, including one at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, diverted income from his business to the charity to avoid paying income tax, and donated foundation money to support Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a Republican, who was considering launching an investigation into Trump University, Trumps for-profit education venture. The foundation ended up paying a $2,500 fine to the IRS for that donation. A Trump Organization representative told the Post the donation was meant to be from Trumps personal account, and that it came from his foundations account by clerical error. In response to the Posts reporting, Schneidermans office began a probe into the Trump Foundation. The Trump campaign said in a statement on Monday that the charity would cooperate with the investigation. While we remain very concerned about the political motives behind AG Schneidermans investigation, the Trump Foundation nevertheless intends to cooperate fully with the investigation, said Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks. Because this is an ongoing legal matter, the Trump Foundation will not comment further at this time, she added. The New York Attorney Generals Office is the sole regulator of charities in the state. A spokesman for the office said it was not unusual for the regulator to send notices to charities whose filings were overdue or incomplete but that a cease-and-desist letter was more serious. While letters such as the one the Trump Foundation, which is based in Woodbury, New York, on Long Island, received are not judgments of wrongdoing, they are sent only after the office gets a clear indication of wrongdoing, the spokesman said. Trump established the charitable foundation in 1988, but it runs no programs of its own. Instead, it donates money to other nonprofit groups such as the Police Athletic League for youths. Once the foundation began soliciting money from other donors beyond the Trump family, it was required by New York law to register with the state and file regular reports.

Trump defends remarks on veterans and mental health,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trumps campaign defended comments he made on combat veterans and mental health on Monday, after some said his remarks implied service members diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were weak. At an event with veterans in Herndon, Virginia, Trump called for better mental health services for those returning from combat, saying that while many are strong, others cant handle what they have seen on the battlefield. The response struck some as insulting to veterans struggling with PTSD, as the Republican candidate works to motivate traditionally conservative military voters to support him in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, a Trump adviser on military issues, said in a written statement that the candidates comments were taken out of context in order to deceive voters and veterans. Marine Staff Sergeant Chad Robichaux, whose question at the event prompted Trumps statement, said the critical reaction was sickening and accused others of manipulating Trumps words. I took his comments to be thoughtful and understanding of the struggles many veterans have, said Robichaux, an Afghanistan combat veteran who has been diagnosed with PTSD. Trump made his remarks at an event hosted by a political action committee called Retired American Warriors. Trump has cast himself a champion of veterans during his campaign and in July pledged to reform federal programs for war veterans. He attended a military preparatory school but did not serve in the U.S. military.  Joe Donnelly, a Democratic U.S. senator from Indiana, was one of the first to criticize Trumps remarks. We need to dismiss the idea that mental health issues signify weakness, and reinforce that there is strength in seeking help, Donnelly said in a written statement. PTSD was among the most talked about topics on Twitter on Monday, as many social media users responded to Trumps comments. @realDonaldTrump As a Veteran with PTSD, Im stronger than you could ever be, tweeted Kevin Plantz (@KevinPlantz). My husband served this country honorably, tweeted Melissa Bird (@birdgirl1001). He has #PTSD. #Trump has officially crossed the line for me and my family. Neither the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs nor the campaign for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, immediately returned requests for comment.

U.S. appeals court sides against Pence in Syrian refugee case,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Indiana Governor Mike Pence, the Republican nominee for U.S. vice president, lost another round in federal court on Monday in his bid to keep refugees fleeing Syrias civil war from resettling in his state. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago affirmed a lower-court ruling that Pences order seeking to bar state agencies from helping the resettlement of Syrian immigrants discriminates against the refugees based on their national origin. The setback for Pence comes a day before he is scheduled to debate the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Virginia Governor Tim Kaine, on national television. Pence was among more than 25 U.S. governors, mostly Republicans, who urged President Barack Obama to stop resettling refugees fleeing Syrias civil war after November attacks by extremists in Paris that killed 130. Critics of the resettlement program have argued that it leaves the United States vulnerable to infiltration by militants from Islamic State, also known as ISIS, which has seized vast swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq and claimed responsibility for attacks on civilians in Paris and elsewhere. But Appeals Court Judge Richard Posner, writing for the three-judge panel that sided unanimously against Pence, said the governors assertions of a national security threat were presented without evidence and amounted to nightmare speculation. All three appellate panel members are Republican appointees, including Judge Diane Sykes, who Pences running mate, Donald Trump, has said he would nominate to the U.S. Supreme Court if he wins the Nov. 8 presidential election. A Pence spokeswoman, Kara Brooks, said the FBI and U.S. Homeland Security Department have acknowledged security gaps in screening of Syrian refugees. She also quoted a State Department spokesman who said last month that he wouldnt debate the fact that theres the potential for ISIS terrorists to try to insert themselves into the refugee program.  Pences order was blocked by a U.S. district judge in February after a court challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and he appealed.  The ACLU welcomed the courts ruling on Monday as upholding the groups position that the governor may not constitutionally or legally discriminate against a particular nationality of refugees that are extensively vetted by the federal government. Indiana has accepted 150 Syrian immigrants between Oct. 1, 2015, and Aug. 31, 2016, accounting for about 9 percent of all refugee arrivals in the state during that period, according to the State Department.

U.S. top court denies Obama request to rehear major immigration case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to rehear a bid to revive President Barack Obamas plan to spare from deportation millions of immigrants in the country illegally, a case in which the justices split 4-4 in June. In a brief order, the court rejected the Obama administrations long-shot request, meaning the justices June 23 decision is final. That ruling left in place lower court decisions blocking the plan, which Obama announced in 2014 but never went into effect. The high court remains one justice short following Antonin Scalias February death. The Democratic presidents plan was challenged in court by Republican-governed Texas and 25 other states that argued he overstepped the powers granted to him by the U.S. Constitution by infringing upon congressional authority. Obama acted unilaterally by executive action, bypassing the Republican-led Congress. This is the latest setback to the presidents attempt to expand executive power and another victory for those who believe in the Constitutions separation of powers and the rule of law, Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said of the Supreme Courts action on Monday. Obamas plan was designed to let roughly 4 million people - those who have lived illegally in the United States at least since 2010, have no criminal record and have children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents - get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits. The administration in July asked the court to take a second look at the case once it had a full complement of nine justices. The inability of the Supreme Court in this situation to reach a decision and put forward a ruling has a negative impact on millions of people in the United States, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters, calling on Senate Republicans to confirm a ninth justice. The administrations immigration enforcement efforts, focusing on criminals, recent border-crossers and on people who pose a national security threat, will move forward, unaffected by the Supreme Courts action, Earnest said. The Republican-led Senate, in a move with little precedent in U.S. history, has refused to consider Obamas nominee to replace Scalia, federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland, saying Obamas successor should make the appointment. By continuing their historic, unprecedented obstruction of Chief Judge Merrick Garlands nomination, Republicans are spreading gridlock and denying justice to the American people, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said. An estimated 11 million immigrants live in the United States illegally. ",politicsNews,"October 3, 2016 ",1
"Presidential race tightens in Florida, Ohio, Arizona","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. presidential race tightened in a number of traditional battleground states, though Democrat Hillary Clinton remained the favorite to win the White House, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project poll released on Monday. The project, which uses a national online opinion poll of more than 15,000 people, showed that, as of Thursday, Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump were running nearly even in support in Florida and Ohio: states where she had held an advantage. Arizona, where Trump had held an advantage, was also considered a toss-up. Meanwhile, Maine, Oregon and Pennsylvania were considered states that Clinton would likely win. They had previously been considered toss-ups. Overall, the project showed that Clinton continued to hold the advantage over Trump in the Electoral College, the body that ultimately picks the president.  If the U.S. presidential election were held today, Clinton would lead Trump 246 to 180 in the Electoral College, and had an 88 percent chance of gaining the 270 electoral votes needed to become the U.S. chief executive.

Over the past several weeks, the Democrat had maintained a lead of 4 to 5 percentage points in support over Trump among likely voters. ",politicsNews,"October 3, 2016 ",1
U.S. top court rejects bid to revive Wisconsin governor probe,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected a request to revive an investigation in Wisconsin into whether Governor Scott Walkers campaign to withstand a union-backed 2012 recall election illegally coordinated with conservative advocacy groups aligned with him. The justices, on the first day of their new term, let stand a 2015 Wisconsin Supreme Court decision to end the probe into whether the Republican governor and conservative groups violated campaign finance laws. The investigation, led by special prosecutor Francis Schmitz, was launched two months after Walker became the first state governor in U.S. history to survive a recall election. Walker last year mounted an unsuccessful bid for his partys presidential nomination. The United States Supreme Court, the Wisconsin Supreme Court and multiple judges have all reached the same conclusion with every ruling - that this investigation by prosecutors was without merit and thus must be ended, Walker said in a statement. Walker last year signed a state law prohibiting prosecutors from using Wisconsins secret investigation statute, which had been used to convict four of his aides and investigate his campaign, to probe political crimes. Three Democratic county prosecutors who asked the justices to hear an appeal of the state court ruling expressed disappointment. The state Supreme Court decision, left intact by todays order, prohibits Wisconsin citizens from enacting laws requiring the full disclosure of disguised contributions to a candidate, they said in a statement. That includes money spent by third parties at the direction of a candidate to support that candidates election, they added. The investigation focused on possible unlawful coordination between Walkers campaign and conservative groups including the Wisconsin Club for Growth in 2011 and 2012. A federal judge in 2014 initially stopped the probe after the Wisconsin Club for Growth filed a lawsuit accusing investigators of sidelining the group from political activities and violating its rights under the U.S. Constitution to free speech, association and equal protection under the law. A federal appeals court later said the investigation could continue but Wisconsins high court ultimately stopped it. Brendan Fischer, a lawyer with the Campaign Legal Center that advocates strong enforcement of campaign finance laws, said the justices move did not endorse Walkers actions. Governor Walker secretly told out-of-state donors they could support him by secretly giving to Wisconsin Club for Growth which, he emphasized, could accept corporate contributions without limit, Fischer said. Walkers campaign adviser controlled how Wisconsin Club for Growth spent the money, and after winning re-election, Walker signed legislation advancing the interests of the secret donors.

GAO to examine panel on foreign investment in U.S. strategic firms,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The investigative arm of Congress has agreed to examine whether a panel that oversees foreign investment in the United States has the legal powers it needs to keep up with efforts by state-owned firms in Russia and China to buy strategic U.S. companies. The Government Accountability Office said in a letter to lawmakers released on Monday that it would begin the review in about four months once the staff with the needed expertise were cleared of other duties. The letter was dated Sept. 30. The study is being initiated in response to a request on Sept. 15 by 16 members of Congress, who voiced concern that legislation governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has not been updated enough to ensure the panel can do its job effectively. Now is an opportune time for GAO to review what has worked well, and where CFIUS authorities may need to be expanded, especially given the rise in state-owned enterprises and state-controlled enterprises from China and Russia, among other designated countries, the lawmakers said in their letter. The letter from the lawmakers noted that foreign investment oversight began as an executive order from the president and was only codified by Congress in response to concerns about foreign ownership of defense industries and ports. The letter said lawmakers were now concerned about recent investments in the telecommunications, media and agriculture sectors that raised questions about the degree to which foreign ownership ... may pose a strategic rather than overt national security threat. It noted that Chinese companies designated by Beijing as state champions often benefited from illegal subsidies in order to gain strategic access to markets like the United States. The letter said Congress had raised concerns about China National Chemical Corps (ChemChina) CNNCC.UL planned $43 billion acquisition of Swiss agricultural seed and pesticides provider Syngenta AG SYNN.S and to Dalian Wanda Groups bid for major American movie studios like Legendary Entertainment and Paramount Studios. It said the media acquisitions were particularly concerning because of Chinas efforts to censor topics and exert propaganda controls on American media. These examples raise serious security questions about what authority CFIUS currently has, or may need to be added, to address these concerns, the lawmakers said in their letter.

"U.S. Sept. 11 law weakens international relations, Saudi cabinet says","DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Monday that a U.S. law allowing citizens to sue the kingdom over the Sept. 11 2001 attacks represented a threat to international relations and urged Congress to act to prevent any dangerous consequences from the new legislation. The cabinet, at its weekly meeting in the capital Riyadh, also said that the law, known as JASTA, represented a violation of a leading principle preventing lawsuits against governments that regulated international relations for hundreds of years. Weakening this sovereign immunity will affect all countries, including the United States, the statement by Saudi Information Minister Adel al-Toraifi, carried by Saudi state news agency SPA, said. (The cabinet) expressed hope that wisdom will prevail and that the U.S. Congress would take the necessary steps to avoid the bad and dangerous consequences that may result from the JASTA legislation, it added. The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly last Wednesday to approve legislation that will allow the families of those killed in the 2001 attacks on the United States to seek damages from the Saudi government. Fifteen out of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals.    Riyadh has always dismissed suspicions that it backed the attackers, who killed nearly 3,000 people under the banner of Islamist militant group al-Qaeda.  Riyadh is one of Washingtons longest-standing and most important allies in the Middle East and part of a U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. The Saudi government lobbied strongly against JASTA, which stands for the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act,  in the run-up to the vote, and warned it would undermine the principle of sovereign immunity. But Saudi officials stopped short of threatening any specific retaliation if the law was passed. ",politicsNews,"October 3, 2016 ",1
"Trump's tax writeoff shows his 'genius' at business, advisers say","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumps decision to take a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax return showed his business acumen and genius at figuring out how to minimize his tax bill, two of the Republican presidential candidates advisers said on Sunday. This is a perfectly legal application of the tax code. And he would have been fool not to take advantage of it, said Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor who is one of Trumps advisers. Speaking on the ABC program This Week, Giuliani said that as a business owner, Trump has a fiduciary duty to the investors in his real estate company to maximize profits. Giuliani compared Trumps ability to come back from the nearly $1-billion loss to turnarounds made by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and Winston Churchill, the former British prime minister who led the United Kingdom through World War Two. It shows what a genius he is. It shows he was able to preserve his enterprise, and then he was able to build it, Giuliani said on CNNs State of the Union. The New York Times reported on Saturday that it had obtained Trumps 1995 tax records and it quoted experts as saying that the $916 million loss he reported for that year may have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years. Susanne Craig, one of the Times reporters who was bylined on the story about Trumps tax records, said the tax documents arrived in a manila envelope in her mailbox at the Times with a return address of the Trump Organization. She said a lawyer for Trump had threatened the newspaper with legal action if it decided to publish the documents. The tax benefits outlined in the documents stemmed from financial deals Trump made that went bad in the early 1990s. The Trump campaign, in a statement on Saturday, said the tax document was obtained illegally and accused the New York Times of operating as an extension of the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, Trumps rival in the Nov. 8 election. I know our complex tax laws better than anyone who has ever run for president and am the only one who can fix them. #failing@nytimes, Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday. Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor and head of Trumps presidential transition team, said that Trumps records showed that the U.S. tax code was an absolute mess and that Trump was the best person to fix it. Theres no one who has shown more genius in their way to maneuver about the tax code as he rightfully used the laws to do that, Christie said on Fox News Sunday. But Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said the tax writeoff shows the colossal scale of his business failures and that the wealthy real estate developer operates under a different set of rules than ordinary taxpayers. Clinton has repeatedly called on Trump to release his tax returns, as is standard procedure for modern presidential candidates. Trump has declined to release his tax records, saying he will not do so until an audit of his returns by the Internal Revenue Service is complete. The IRS has said that an audit does not bar an individual from sharing their own tax information. ",politicsNews,"October 2, 2016 ",1
Clinton: My worries are not the same as black grandmothers',"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton told a majority-black church in North Carolina on Sunday that she knows her grandchildren are growing up in a different world than many black youth in the U.S. who are concerned about police shootings and gun violence in their communities. The Democratic presidential nominees remarks at the Little Rock AME Zion Church in Charlotte were a frank acknowledgment of the impact of what she has called implicit bias in policing can have on black communities. Clinton cited the death of 43-year-old Keith Scott, a black man who was shot by police in front of a Charlotte apartment complex on Sept. 20. She also lamented the death of 40-year-old Terence Crutcher, who was shot days before during a Tulsa traffic stop. Both shootings led to community protests. The Tulsa police officer has pleaded not guilty to a manslaughter charge. Im a grandmother, and like every grandmother, I worry about the safety and security of my grandchildren, but my worries are not the same as black grandmothers, who have different and deeper fears about the world that their grandchildren face, Clinton said. Clinton described testimony that Taje Gaddy, 10, and Zianna Oliphant, 9, gave last week before the Charlotte City Council about violence in their community. Clinton later summoned Oliphant to join her on the stage. I wouldnt be able to stand it if my grandchildren had to be scared and worried the way too many children across our country feel right now. But because my grandchildren are white, because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state, lets be honest here, they wont face the kind of fear that we heard from the children testifying before the city council, Clinton said. Clinton has made gun violence a focus of her presidential campaign. Mothers who have lost children in shootings have joined her on the campaign trail. Clinton has said police officers should be trained to recognize implicit bias and called for the official police video of the Charlotte shooting to be released. Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, said at a rally after Crutchers shooting that it looked like he had done everything he was supposed to do.  On Twitter, he criticized Clintons trip to Charlotte, which was postponed one week at the behest of the citys mayor, as a chance to grandstand.

'No doubt' Russia behind hacks on U.S. election system: senior Democrat,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior Democratic lawmaker said Sunday he had no doubt that Russia was behind recent hacking attempts targeting state election systems, and urged the Obama administration to publicly blame Moscow for trying to undermine confidence in the Nov. 8 presidential contest. The remarks from Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, come amid heightened concerns among U.S. and state officials about the security of voting machines and databases, and unsubstantiated allegations from Republican candidate Donald Trump that the election could be rigged. I have no doubt [this is Russia]. And I dont think the administration has any doubt, Schiff said during an appearance on ABCs This Week. Schiffs call to name and shame the Kremlin came a week after Trump questioned widely held conclusions made privately by the U.S. intelligence community that Russia is responsible for the hacking activity. It could be Russia, but it could also be China, Trump said during a televised debate with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds. On Saturday, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said hackers have probed the voting systems of many U.S. states but there is no sign that they have manipulated any voting data. Schiff said he doubted hackers could falsify vote tallies in a way to affect the election outcome. Officials and experts have said the decentralized and outdated nature of U.S. voting technology makes such hacks more unlikely. But cyber attacks on voter registration systems could sow discord on election day, Schiff said. He further added that leaks of doctored emails would be difficult to disprove and could be election altering. The National Security Agency, FBI and DHS all concluded weeks ago that Russian intelligence agencies conducted, directed or coordinated all the major cyberattacks on U.S. political organizations, including the Democratic National Committee, and individuals, a U.S. official who is participating in the investigations said on Sunday.   However, the official said, White House officials have resisted naming the Russians publicly because doing so could result in escalating cyberattacks, and because it is considered impossible to offer public, unclassified proof of the allegation.  Schiff and Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate intelligence committee, said last month they had concluded Russian intelligence agencies were making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election.

"'Study, pray, vote,' Pope tells Americans ahead of elections","ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Sunday advised U.S. Catholics who feel they are torn between two imperfect candidates for president to study and pray before they vote and to make sure to follow their conscience. During his traditional, freewheeling in-flight news conference with reporters on the plane returning from Azerbaijan, Francis was asked how he would counsel American faithful and what wisdom they should keep in mind. You have asked me a question that describes a difficult choice because, according to you, there are difficulties with one and difficulties with the other, the pope said, without naming Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump. In posing the question, the reporter made allusions to Clintons support of abortion and Trumps statements vilifying migrants and religious minorities. During political campaigns, I never say a word, the pope said. The people are sovereign. I would only say, study the proposals well, pray and choose with your conscience.  But in the rest of his response, while stressing that he wanted to talk about a fictional situation, Francis appeared to be saying that the United States was among the countries that had become so politicized that it had effectively lost what he called a culture of politics. When in any country there are two, three or four candidates who dont satisfy everyone, it means that perhaps the political life of that country has become too politicized and that it does not have much political culture, he said. People say Im from this party or Im from that party, but effectively, they dont have clear thoughts about the basics, about proposals, he said. Last February, while returning from Mexico, the pope was asked if U.S. Catholics could vote for someone with Trumps views on immigration, particularly on the candidates promise to build a wall at the border with Mexico. He said a person with such views was not Christian. Trump struck back, calling the popes comments disgraceful.    ",politicsNews,"October 2, 2016 ",1
"In search of rebound, Trump ramps up attacks on Clinton","MANHEIM, Pa. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump closed out a rough week for his campaign on Saturday by escalating personal attacks on Democrat Hillary Clinton, questioning her stamina and saying she should be in prison for her handling of classified emails. After a week in which he drew wide criticism for a public feud with a former beauty queen, Trump sought to rebound with a highly negative attack on his opponent in the Nov. 8 election, with a second presidential debate against her looming in a week. At the same time, the New York Times reported it had obtained records showing Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns, a deduction so large that it may have allowed him to avoid paying any federal income taxes for years. Trump has refused to release his tax records, saying he is under a federal audit. At a rally in Manheim, Pennsylvania, Trump said he did not believe Clinton, who suffered a bout of pneumonia last month, was up to the task of being president. He tried to resurrect a tactic he employed against former Republican rival Jeb Bush, who Trump had derided as low energy. Clinton kept her pneumonia diagnosis private until she was seen nearly collapsing while getting into her vehicle at a ceremony marking the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York. Ticking off a list of world problems, Trump said, Shes supposed to fight all of these things and she cant make it 15 feet to her car. Give me a break. Folks, we need stamina, we need energy, we need people who are going to turn deals around, Trump said. Trump has often told crowds who chant lock her up over her use of a private email server as U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 to instead help him defeat her. But on Saturday, Trump told thousands of supporters that Clintons handling of classified emails and destroying of 33,000 emails that she had deemed of a personal nature meant that she should be in prison, let me tell you. Trump did not stop there. He said he did not believe Clinton would be loyal to her supporters and chuckled, I dont even think shes loyal to Bill, to tell you the truth. And why should she be, right? Why should she be? In 1998, Clintons husband, former President Bill Clinton, was caught up in a sex scandal involving former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Trump was widely seen as having lost his first presidential debate with Clinton last Monday although he cites online polls showing he won. In the days since the debate, Trump has been struggling to regain his footing, getting caught up in a back-and-forth with former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who Trump had criticized for gaining weight.

Trump's 1995 tax records suggest no federal taxes for years: New York Times,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns and the large tax deduction may have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years, the New York Times reported on Saturday. The Trump campaign, in a statement responding to the Times report, said that the tax document was obtained illegally and that the New York Times is operating as an extension of the presidential campaign of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. The Times said it had obtained Trumps 1995 tax records and that they showed he received the large tax benefits from financial deals that went bad in the early 1990s. The newspaper said that tax experts it hired to analyze Trumps records said tax rules which are especially advantageous to wealthy filers would have let Trump use his $916 million loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income over an 18-year period. The Times said that although Trumps taxable income in subsequent years is as yet unknown, a $916 million loss in 1995 would have been large enough to wipe out more than $50 million a year in taxable income over 18 years. Trump has declined to release his tax records, unlike previous presidential nominees in modern history, saying his taxes are under a federal audit. Experts say he could still release them publicly if he wished. Mr. Trump is a highly-skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required, the Trump campaign statement said. That being said, Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes, along with very substantial charitable contributions, it said.

"Live from New York, it's a Trump-Clinton rematch - of sorts","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Veteran actor and frequent host Alec Baldwin returned to Saturday Night Live on Saturday, debuting his new gig playing a scowling, blustering Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for U.S. president. The late night NBC comedy show, kicking off its 42nd season, opened with an extended sketch featuring Baldwin as Trump facing off with a calculating, cunning and smug Hillary Clinton, with Kate McKinnon reprising her turn as the Democratic nominee. Much of the routine was lifted from the opponents Monday debate, including references to talk show host and Trump nemesis Rosie ODonnell, and vocal Trump backer, Fox News Sean Hannity. Baldwin began his Trump routine promising Im going to be so good tonight, before issuing a perfunctory response on jobs and economics. End of story, I won the debate, I stayed calm just like I promised, and it, is, over. Goodnight, he proclaimed before walking away. Told by the moderator there were still 88 minutes left, Trump responded, My microphone is broken, adding She broke it. With Obama. Asked what she thought of Trumps rambling discourse, a smirking McKinnon-as-Clinton replied I think Im going to be president. The audience for the live show applauded wildly. After a few more minutes of Baldwin-as-Trumps increasingly bizarre remarks, a swaggering Clinton asks Can America vote right now? Later, fighting tears, she explained, This is going so well. Its going exactly how I always dreamed. The shows writers made sure to take shots at the Democrat as well, including her referencing beauty queen Alicia Machado as a political prop that I almost forgot to mention. In her closing statement, Clinton said Listen America, I get it, you hate me. She then threatened that If you dont elect me, I will continue to run for president until the day I die. Baldwin, who has hosted Saturday Night Live more than anyone in its storied history, will be back as Trump until the November election, likely providing a ratings spike for the show that has mined U.S. elections and politics for comic fodder since 1975. Trump himself appeared on the show as host in November 2015, when he was campaigning to win the Republican nomination. ",politicsNews,"October 2, 2016 ",1
"U.S. says hackers probed voting systems, no sign of damage","(Reuters) - Hackers have probed the voting systems of many U.S. states but there is no sign that they have manipulated any voting data, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on Saturday. National security officials are investigating a number of possible leads suggesting that cyber-criminals are trying to influence the Nov. 8 presidential election, including by hacking into systems run by the Democratic National Committee. Republican candidate Donald Trump has repeatedly charged that the U.S. election system is rigged and top Democrats in Congress have charged that Russia is behind repeated attempts to access both party data and state voting systems. In recent months, malicious cyber actors have been scanning a large number of state systems, which could be a preamble to attempted intrusions, Johnson said in a statement. In a few cases, we have determined that malicious actors gained access to state voting-related systems. However, we are not aware at this time of any manipulation of data. The head of the Democratic National Committee, Donna Brazile, last month said the organization had been hacked by Russian state-sponsored agents who were trying to influence the election, when voters will choose between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Trump, a New York real estate developer. Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned as DNC chair on the eve of Julys Democratic National Convention after WikiLeaks published a trove of hacked DNC emails that showed party officials favoring eventual nominee Hillary Clinton over Senator Bernie Sanders during the partys nominating contests.

German government believes Trump would ravage U.S. economy: Spiegel,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germanys economy ministry believes a Donald Trump presidency would severely damage the U.S. economy, according to an internal memorandum reported by Der Spiegel magazine on Saturday. The ministry expects shrinking gross domestic product, fewer jobs and higher unemployment, in the United States if the Republican candidate were to implement his campaign pledges, the magazine cited the memo as saying. Trump, a billionaire businessman seeking his first public office, has proposed tax cuts worth $4.4 trillion and wants to curb government regulation and take a tougher stance on negotiating trade deals. He says his economic plan would produce annual economic growth of 3.5 percent and create 25 million jobs over a decade. But some economists have questioned the assumptions underpinning the plan. Trumps pledges are not feasible, Spiegel cited the memorandum as saying. Moreover, the plans would violate international or U.S. law and could be no basis for a realistic economic policy.  A spokeswoman for the German Economy Ministry declined to comment on the Spiegel report.     Last month, economic research firm Oxford Economics projected the U.S. economy could be $1 trillion smaller than otherwise expected in 2021 if Trump becomes president.

"Trump goes on offensive against former beauty queen, Clinton calls him 'unhinged'","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump increased his attacks on a former beauty queen with a vague and unsubstantiated allegation about a sex tape in predawn Twitter posts on Friday, and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton denounced him as unhinged. Trumps refusal to drop his invective against Alicia Machado, the Miss Universe from Venezuela whom he criticized for gaining weight after she won the crown in 1996, threatened to damage his already weak standing among women and Hispanics. With less than six weeks to go until the Nov. 8 election, Trump made reference - without giving evidence - to a sex tape involving Machado, who had publicly denounced him all week as a humiliating bully. His attacks provided critics with new fodder to question his temperament for the White House.  Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate? Trump said in his Twitter messages in the early hours of Friday. He did not elaborate on his allegations beyond saying that the Clinton campaign was unaware of the beauty queens past and had been duped by her.  At a campaign rally in Coral Springs, Florida, Clinton said the episode was evidence that a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have the nuclear codes. Who gets up at 3 a.m. in the morning to engage in a Twitter attack against a former Miss Universe? I mean he hurled as many insults as he could. Really, why does he do things like that?  His latest Twitter meltdown is unhinged, even for him. It proves again he is temperamentally unfit to be President of the United States, she said. Later on Friday, BuzzFeed said Trump made an appearance in a Playboy softcore pornographic movie from 2000 that it said it had obtained from an online adult video store in New York state. Trumps role in the porn is relatively benign and centers around him breaking a bottle of champagne on a Playboy-branded limo while several of the playmates are visiting New York City, the online media outlet said. Theres been a lot of talk about sex tapes today and in a strange turn of events only one adult film has emerged today and its star is Donald Trump, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill told reporters after a campaign event in Florida. Reuters could not confirm the BuzzFeed report. The Trump campaign did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Merrill earlier said Clinton called Machado on Friday to thank her for what he said was the courage she has shown. Politico reported that Machado has starred in racy reality TV programs and posed naked for Playboys Mexican version, but said media outlets have found no evidence that she has starred in pornographic films. Machado, now a U.S. citizen, dismissed the fresh attacks with a message on Instagram, calling them cheap lies from a man intent on defaming her. By way of his hate campaign, the Republican candidate insists on discrediting and demoralizing a woman, which is clearly one of his most frightening characteristics, she wrote in her post in Spanish, next to a photo of herself draped in an American flag. Clinton raised Trumps treatment of Machado during their  first presidential debate on Monday as an example of how he views women. Clinton said Trump, the former owner of the Miss Universe pageants, had called Machado Miss Piggy and also Miss Housekeeping because she was a Latina. Trump attacked Machado the following day in a television interview as he sought to rebound from a debate that Clinton was widely viewed as having won. He also promised to hit Clinton harder in their next debate, on Oct. 9, suggesting he might attack Clinton on the infidelities of her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Speaking to Fox News on Tuesday, Trump said Machado had gained a massive amount of weight after her pageant win and that it was a real problem. Critics said his offensive this week raised questions about Trumps character. The 70-year-old former reality TV star has never run for office before and his habit of making off-the-cuff insults has alarmed many in the Republican Party establishment. In taking the bait Clinton dangled on Monday, Trump echoed his August entanglement in a days-long public dispute with the parents of a Muslim Army captain killed in Iraq. That incident caused anguish among many Republican leaders concerned that he had nothing to gain by attacking a grieving family. Trumps remarks on Friday could hurt him further with women and Hispanic voters. Clinton, 68, a former U.S. senator and secretary of state, is the first woman to win the presidential nomination of a major U.S. political party and has led Trump in opinion polls. The latest Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll, released on Friday, showed Clinton leading by 43 percent to Trumps 38 percent among likely voters. Clinton mocked Trump this week after he complained that he had a faulty microphone during Mondays debate. The Commission on Presidential Debates said on Friday that, Regarding the first debate, there were issues regarding Donald Trumps audio that affected the sound level in the debate hall.  The sound was not affected for the record-setting audience of 84 million people who tuned into the 90-minute exchange.  At a rally in Novi, Michigan, Trump wondered aloud whether the microphone problem was deliberate. Its difficult, and when you have a situation like that and you know its bad and you think that 100 million people are watching, what do you do, stop the show? I wonder why it was bad, he said.

Puerto Rico board sets Oct. 14 date for draft turnaround plan,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Ricos newly created federal oversight board set an Oct. 14 deadline for the islands governor to draft a fiscal turnaround plan on Friday, as its first public meeting was disrupted by angry protesters. The board asked Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla to present a plan laying out his vision for stabilizing Puerto Rico, which is grappling with $70 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and a decade-long recession.  The seven-member board, created under the Puerto Rico rescue law known as PROMESA, was appointed on Aug. 31 by President Barack Obama and legislators. It will have broad powers to manage Puerto Ricos finances and facilitate debt restructuring talks with creditors. The board met for the first time on Friday in Manhattan, electing Jose Carrion III as chairman. Carrion, one of four native Puerto Ricans on the panel, is an insurance executive and past chairman of Puerto Ricos Workers Compensation Board. Were working as quickly as possible, and were establishing the procedures as transparently as possible, Carrion told reporters after the meeting, which lasted less than 30 minutes. It is unclear what impact Garcia Padillas fiscal turnaround plan will have. The unpopular governor is not seeking a second term in the Nov. 8 election, and the front-runner for his seat, a member of an opposition party, has different views on how to right Puerto Ricos ship, including by shrinking government and avoiding the debt defaults Garcia Padilla has initiated over the last year.  Garcia Padilla, in a statement late on Friday, called Carrions leadership of the board a positive step. In this process, we will try to make the Board understand that, for the recovery to be real, it must deal with the fiscal aspects, while protecting the economic ones, Garcia Padilla said. Protesters inside the auditorium interrupted the meeting, shouting profanities and likening the board to a form of slavery.  Shame on all of you, yelled one protester before being thrown out. Stop pillaging Puerto Rico.  The board on Friday also voted to include most major Puerto Rican entities as covered entities under its oversight, including Puerto Rico itself, its public pension systems, its highway, water and electric authorities and sales tax authority COFINA.  The board voted to request financial information from Garcia Padilla including weekly cash flow reports, monthly reports on revenues and tax collection efforts and monthly payroll reports.

Trump says comments on Mexicans good for restaurant business: documents,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump said he believed his assertion last year that Mexicans crossing the border illegally are rapists bringing crime were pretty mainstream and should have attracted customers to his new Washington restaurant, according to court records BuzzFeed News published on Friday. Ive tapped into something and Ive tapped into illegal immigration, the Republican presidential candidate said in a June 16 deposition for a lawsuit against a celebrity chef who dropped out of the restaurant venture at his new hotel. Chef Geoffrey Zakarian pulled out after Trumps June 15, 2015 comments as he announced his bid for the White House. Trump said Zakarian may have missed an opportunity. If he had the restaurant, it would be helped instead of hurt by the comments, Trump said in the deposition. Zakarian, who has appeared in cooking shows like The Next Iron Chef, Chopped and Top Chef, signed a deal with Trump to open the restaurant in the historic Old Post Office building near the White House, which Trump won the right to lease and renovate from the U.S. government.  The project, called the Trump International Hotel, opened on Sept. 12, almost a year after it was originally expected to begin operating. Zakarian backed out in July 2015, after the speech Trump gave on June 16, 2015 announcing his candidacy and bemoaning the flow of people across the southern U.S. border. Zakarian said Trumps comments were out of sync with his personal core values. Several companies, including Macys Inc, broadcaster NBC and stock car racing organization NASCAR, also cut ties with Trump after his comments. Trump, through his subsidiary operating the hotel, sued Zakarian, alleging the broken deal cost him more than $10 million.  In the deposition, Trump also said his comments about Mexicans illegally crossing the border had helped him win the Republican presidential nomination, a sign his views were pretty mainstream. The case is Trump Old Post Office LLC et al v. CZ-National LLC, et al, District of Columbia Superior Court. ",politicsNews,"September 30, 2016 ",1
Betting on the U.S. election via the 'Trump ETF',"NEW YORK (Reuters) - An exchange-traded fund focused on Mexico has become a weather vane for Republican Donald Trumps chances winning the U.S. presidential election in November, investors said. Mexico has been a prime target for Trump, who has accused the country of taking away jobs from Americans, focusing particular ire on a landmark 1990s trade agreement with the United States southern neighbor and Canada. He has said he will renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, commonly known as NAFTA, or pull out of it, and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to curb illegal immigration. Although a range of factors influence all markets, investors said this week that the U.S.-listed iShares MSCI Mexico Capped ETF (EWW) is increasingly being driven by the prospect of the New York businessmans election. It has been a good year for equity investors in emerging markets in general after three years of negative returns. But the $1 billion ETF has underperformed and is now in negative territory for the year as the peso has fallen and Trumps chances of winning the Nov. 8 election have gone up - though predictive models such as FiveThirtyEight and betting markets still forecast a Clinton victory. Short interest in the ETF - essentially bets that it will fall in price - have risen 59 percent since last month as Trump gained steam, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners LLC. Trumps worst relative showing in the past few months was Aug. 9, when a closely watched opinion polling average showed him nearly 8 percentage points behind Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Her lead has tightened to about 3 points, according to the RealClearPolitics average, although it is off lows of less than 1 point earlier this month. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday gave Clinton a 5-point lead over Trump, with 43 percent of likely voters. Shorting the EWW ETF may be a vehicle to bet on Mr. Trumps success in being elected the next president of the U.S. and his willingness to address the long-standing Mexican trade imbalance, Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3 Partners head of research, said in an email interview. In other words, as Trumps popularity rises, the chances of a negative impact on the Mexican economy rises. But it is not just shorts. The funds price has also tended to suffer when polling averages and betting markets forecast Trump doing better. By contrast, the fund has tended to rise with Clintons prospects, according to a Reuters analysis of market data, the polling averages and PredictIt prediction market data over the last quarter. The ETF saw a mild rebound this week after Clinton was seen by most as besting Trump in their first presidential debate on Monday. Much of the negative performance has been driven by the decline of the peso since last month, which hurt returns for U.S. dollar investors even when Mexican stocks hold their value. Theres no reason for the peso to go from 18.20 to 19.50 (per dollar) unless its because Trump has gone from being behind to being dead even with Hillary, David Garff, president of Accuvest Global Advisors, which sold its last share of the fund in May, said in a phone interview. Mexicos central bank chief Agustin Carstens said on Friday that it was a reality that there was a correlation between his countrys weakening currency and the Trump campaign.  I cant deny theres a knee-jerk reaction by the peso when it was perceived (Trump) did badly in the debate, said Win Thin, global head of emerging market currency strategy at financial services firm Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, but the pesos been weakening for several years even before Trump became the nominee. The media has been playing this up a bit, but Mexicos already suffering from low oil prices, sluggish growth, he said. The peso is often used as a proxy for the wider emerging markets, so theres all these other factors that to me are more important to determining the peso exchange rather than Trump. Even if the pesos decline has already come to an end, Accuvests Garff said Mexican stocks held by the ETF could still be in for pain under a Trump presidency. Four-fifths of Mexicos exports go to the United States, and Garff said Mexican manufacturers could suffer if the United States forces its NAFTA partners to renegotiate the treaty. Central bank chief Carstens, speaking on local radio, said a Trump victory would hit his country like a hurricane, adding that the scenario for Mexico was better with a Clinton win.  If Trump does try to blow up NAFTA, it will hurt Mexico. No question, said Garff, the investor. It is a double whammy. ",politicsNews,"September 30, 2016 ",1
Clinton leads Trump by 5 points: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton has a 5 percentage point lead over Republican Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential race, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Friday, roughly the same advantage she has held all month. The survey result showed little movement following Monday nights presidential debate, the first of three debates before the Nov. 8 election. The Sept. 23-29 national tracking poll showed that likely voters support Clinton over Trump by 43 percent to 38 percent, while another 19 percent said they would not pick either candidate. Clinton has mostly led Trump in the poll this year, and her level of support has been 4-5 percentage points higher than Trumps in each of the last four weeks. In a separate poll that included alternative party candidates, Clinton led the field by 4 percentage points. Among likely voters, 42 percent supported Clinton, 38 percent supported Trump, 7 percent supported Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and 3 percent supported Jill Stein of the Green Party. Mondays debate was the most watched presidential debate in U.S. history, with an estimated 84 million people tuning in for the 90-minute exchange. Some 56 percent of Americans adults who watched the debate said Clinton won, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday. Voters appeared to be warming up to both candidates in Fridays poll. Some 48 percent of likely voters said they had an overall favorable view of Clinton, compared with 45 percent in the previous week, while 46 percent said they had a favorable view of Trump, up from 44 percent the week before. The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English in all 50 states. The poll included 2,501 people who were considered likely voters due to their registration status, voting history and stated intention to vote in the election. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points. National opinion polls have differed this year in how they measure support for Clinton and Trump. Some polls, like Reuters/Ipsos, try to include only likely voters, while others include all registered voters. The Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll also gathers responses every day and reports results twice a week, so it often detects trends in sentiment before most other polls. An average of major opinion polls aggregated by RealClearPolitics showed Clinton ahead of Trump by 2.9 percentage points on Friday, or 47.3 points to 44.4, slightly lower than the previous margin of 3 points on Wednesday, but well up from 0.9 point on Sept. 19.

U.S. lawmakers may change September 11 law after rejecting veto,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers expressed doubts on Thursday about Sept. 11 legislation they forced on President Barack Obama, saying the new law allowing lawsuits against Saudi Arabia could be narrowed to ease concerns about its effect on Americans abroad. A day after a rare overwhelming rejection of a presidential veto, the first during Obamas eight years in the White House, the Republican leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives opened the door to fixing the law as they blamed the Democratic president for not consulting them adequately. I do think it is worth further discussing, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters, acknowledging that there could be potential consequences of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, known as JASTA.  House Speaker Paul Ryan said Congress might have to fix the legislation to protect U.S. troops in particular. Ryan did not give a time frame, but Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he thought JASTA could be addressed in Congress lame-duck session after the Nov. 8 election. The law grants an exception to the legal principle of sovereign immunity in cases of terrorism on U.S. soil, clearing the way for lawsuits seeking damages from the Saudi government. Riyadh denies longstanding suspicions that it backed the hijackers who attacked the United States in 2001. Sept. 11 families lobbied intensely for the bill, getting it passed by the House days before the 15th anniversary of the 2001 attacks earlier this month after years of effort. We have to understand the political environment were in right now and the tremendous support the 9/11 victims have in the United States, said Robert Jordan, a former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Riyadh is one of Washingtons longest-standing and most important allies in the Middle East and part of a U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. The Saudis lobbied furiously against JASTA, and the Saudi foreign ministry condemned its passage in a statement on Thursday. The erosion of sovereign immunity will have a negative impact on all nations, including the United States, said the statement, which was carried on state news agency SPA. Still, the new law is not expected to have a lasting effect on the two countries strategic relationship. Saudi-U.S. ties have endured multiple times of deep outrage over 70 years, said Thomas Lippman of the Middle East Institute. The two countries need each other as much today as they did before the day before yesterday, he said. White House spokesman Josh Earnest mocked lawmakers for shifting within minutes from overwhelmingly voting to override Obamas veto to wanting to change the law. I think what weve seen in the United States Congress is a pretty classic case of rapid onset buyers remorse, Earnest told a White House briefing. Corker said he had tried to work out a compromise with the White House, but Obama administration officials declined a meeting. Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer, who championed JASTA in the Senate, said he was open to revisiting the legislation. Im willing to look at any proposal they make but not any that hurt the families, he said at a news conference.  He said he would oppose a suggestion that the measure be narrowed to only apply to the 2001 attacks on Washington and New York. You know what that does? It tells the Saudis to go ahead and do it again, and we wont punish you, Schumer said. Corker said another suggestion was establishing an international tribunal so experts could determine whether there was culpability. He said the Saudis were been willing to work on a compromise, and denied they had threatened retaliation. Trent Lott, a former Republican Senate Majority Leader now at a Washington law firm lobbying for the Saudis, said attorneys would look carefully at JASTAs language. I do feel passionately this is a mistake for a variety of reasons, in terms of threats to troops, diplomats, sovereignty, theres serious problems here. Hopefully we can find a way to change the tenor of this, Lott said. ",politicsNews,"September 29, 2016 ",1
Saudi foreign ministry condemns passage of U.S. Sept. 11 law,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabias foreign ministry condemned the passage of a U.S. law that would allow families of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001  attacks to sue the kingdom for damages, calling it a matter of great concern in a statement on Thursday. The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to approve legislation that will allow the families of those killed in the 2001 attacks on the United States to seek damages from the Saudi government. The erosion of sovereign immunity will have a negative impact on all nations, including the United States, said the Saudi statement, which was carried on state news agency SPA after a day of stony silence from Riyadh. The foreign ministry expressed hope that the U.S. Congress would correct the legislation to avoid the serious unintended consequences that may ensue, without elaborating on what the consequences might be. Riyadh has always dismissed suspicions that it backed the attackers, who killed nearly 3,000 people under the banner of Islamist militant group al-Qaeda. Fifteen out of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals. The Saudi government financed an extensive lobbying campaign against the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, in the run-up to the vote, and warned it would undermine the principle of sovereign immunity. But Saudi officials who had lobbied against the bill stopped short of threatening any specific retaliation if the law was passed. The Saudi riyal fell against the U.S. dollar in the forward foreign exchange market on Thursday after the law was passed. Analysts said a successful lawsuit against the Saudi government would be unlikely at best, but speculated that the uncertainty surrounding the legal implications could negatively affect bilateral trade and investment with a major ally. Saudi Arabias Gulf state neighbor, United Arab Emirates, warned of the long-term grave repercussions of Congress overriding Obamas veto. In a tweet late on Thursday, Anwar Gargash, the UAEs minister of state for foreign  affairs, called the U.S. Congress move a dangerous precedent in international law that undermines the principle of sovereign immunity and the future of sovereign investments in the United States.  In a later tweet Gargash said his countrys reactions on both the legal and investment fronts should not be hasty and that easing the damage requires joint action.

"Congress rejects Obama veto, Saudi September 11 bill becomes law","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congress on Wednesday overwhelmingly rejected President Barack Obamas veto of legislation allowing relatives of the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia, the first veto override of his presidency, just four months before it ends. The House of Representatives voted 348-77 against the veto, hours after the Senate rejected it 97-1, meaning the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act will become law. The vote was a blow to Obama as well as to Saudi Arabia, one of the United States longest-standing allies in the Arab world, and some lawmakers who supported the override already plan to revisit the issue. Obama said he thought the Congress had made a mistake, reiterating his belief that the legislation set a dangerous precedent and indicating that he thought political considerations were behind the vote. If youre perceived as voting against 9/11 families right before an election, not surprisingly, thats a hard vote for people to take. But it would have been the right thing to do, he said on CNN. Obamas 11 previous vetoes were all sustained. But this time almost all his strongest Democratic supporters in Congress joined Republicans to oppose him in one of their last actions before leaving Washington to campaign for the Nov. 8 election. Overriding a presidential veto is something we dont take lightly, but it was important in this case that the families of the victims of 9/11 be allowed to pursue justice, even if that pursuit causes some diplomatic discomforts, Senator Charles Schumer, a top Senate Democrat, said in a statement. Schumer represents New York, site of the World Trade Center and home to many of the nearly 3,000 people killed in the 2001 attacks, survivors and families of victims. The law, known as JASTA, passed the House and Senate without objections earlier this year. Support was fueled by impatience in Congress with Saudi Arabia over its human rights record, promotion of a severe form of Islam tied to militancy and failure to do more to ease the international refugee crisis. The law grants an exception to the legal principle of sovereign immunity in cases of terrorism on U.S. soil, clearing the way for lawsuits seeking damages from the Saudi government. Riyadh has denied longstanding suspicions that it backed the hijackers who attacked the United States in 2001. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals. Family members had tied their last push for the bill to the 15th anniversary of the attacks this month, demonstrating outside the White House and Capitol. On Wednesday, two fire trucks displayed a giant U.S. flag outside the Senate. We rejoice in this triumph and look forward to our day in court and a time when we may finally get more answers regarding who was truly behind the attacks, Terry Strada, whose husband died in the attacks, said in a statement. Obama argued that JASTA could expose U.S. companies, troops and officials to lawsuits if other countries passed reciprocal legislation, and may anger important allies. He called Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and wrote a letter to him explaining that he strongly believed enacting JASTA into law would be detrimental to U.S. interests. Reid became the only senator to side with Obama. Some lawmakers said the White House, which has a history of poor relations with Congress, had waited too long to fight the bill. The Sept. 11 families have received more than $7 billion, but bill backers said their intention was to allow lawsuits to punish any government that backs terrorism on U.S. soil. This bill was carefully negotiated over more than six years, Representative Jerrold Nadler, another New York Democrat, told the House. The issue, however, may not be finished. At least 28 senators signed a letter to JASTAs sponsors, Schumer and Republican Senator John Cornyn, asking that they work with them to mitigate any potential unintended national security and foreign policy consequences. The Saudi government financed an extensive lobbying campaign against the legislation. U.S. corporations including General Electric Co and Dow Chemical Co also opposed it, as did the European Union and other U.S. allies. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, opposed the bill and CIA Director John Brennan said JASTA had grave implications for national security. Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, Hillary Clintons vice presidential running mate, and Bernie Sanders, an independent and former Democratic White House contender, did not vote. Override opponents in the House included Representative Mac Thornberry, Republican chairman of the Armed Services committee, and Adam Smith, its ranking Democrat, citing concern about U.S. forces overseas.

Clinton says Trump may have violated U.S. law on Cuba,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said on Thursday that Republican opponent Donald Trump may have violated U.S. law, following a news report that one of his companies attempted to do business in Cuba. Newsweek said on Thursday that a hotel and casino company controlled by Trump secretly conducted business with Cuba that was illegal under U.S. sanctions in force during Fidel Castros presidency of the Communist-ruled island. (See the Newsweek article: bit.ly/2dmKH3e)  Today we learned about his efforts to do business in Cuba which appear to violate U.S. law, certainly flout American foreign policy, and he has consistently misled people in responding to questions about whether he was attempting to do business in Cuba, Clinton told reporters on her campaign plane. Clinton and Trump are in a close race ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Newsweek, citing interviews with former Trump executives, internal company records and court filings, said the Trump company spent at least $68,000 for a 1998 trip to Cuba at a time when any corporate expenditure in the Caribbean country was prohibited without U.S. government approval. The Trump company did not spend the money directly, but funneled the cash for the Cuba trip through an American consulting firm, Newsweek said. Newsweek cited a former Trump executive as saying the goal of the Cuba trip was to give Trumps company a foothold should Washington loosen or lift the restrictions under the U.S. trade embargo. The former executive said Trump had participated in discussions about the Cuba trip and knew it had taken place, according to Newsweek. The efforts that Trump is making to get into the Cuba market, putting his business interests ahead of the laws of the United States ... shows that he puts his personal and business interests ahead of the laws and the values and the policies of the United States of America, Clinton said.

Houston taco trucks register voters as Latinos flex political muscle,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Taco trucks in Houston have begun doubling as voter registration sites as Latinos in Texas flex their political muscle before the Nov. 8 presidential election in a state that has long symbolized Mexican immigration to the United States. Riffing on widely ridiculed comments by Marco Gutierrez, a supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, that without action on immigration reform, youre going to have taco trucks on every corner, the non-partisan civic group Mi Familia Vota is driving the effort to reach first-time voters. We Latinos have been the group with the most growth in Texas, but this hasnt translated into the political sphere, said Houston coordinator Carlos Zamora. We want to build political capital. Although Texas is a Republican stronghold, demographics in the Lone Star State are seen shifting in favor of Democrats with the steady increase in Hispanic voters, who have historically favored the party. In the 2012 election, Latinos nationally voted for Democratic President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney by 71 percent to 27 percent, according to exit polls. The Pew Research Center estimated this year that 39 percent of Texans were Hispanic and that about 4.8 million Latinos were eligible to vote in the state. Historically, there has been a voter registration gap. In 2012, about 2.6 million Latinos were registered to vote in Texas, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In 2012, Romney beat Obama in Texas by about 16 points. In this years campaign, Trump, whose hardline approach to illegal immigration has alarmed many Hispanics, leads Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state by about 8 points, according to fivethirtyeight.coms average of polls. Mi Familia Vota did not say how many people it hoped to register in Texas. It said that in the first few days of the campaign, it often had to restock registration brochures at the trucks. At Tacos Tierra Caliente, one of eight taco trucks participating in the registration drive in Houston, posters urging customers to vote hung next to the menu of meat stuffings painted on the side of the truck advertising barbacoa, lengua and pollo. At the metal counter where they pay, customers can fill out  voter registration cards that require no postage when mailed. The group plans to expand its campaign to other taco trucks across the countrys fourth most populous city. (Fixes spelling of groups name, paragraphs two and eight.)

"Do not vote for 'demagogue' Trump, USA Today tells its readers","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Branding Donald Trump a dangerous demagogue, USA Today on Thursday urged its readers not to vote for the Republican presidential candidate, but added that it was not endorsing his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton either. The national newspaper said in an editorial that it had never taken sides in U.S. presidential elections in its 34-year history, but was abandoning the practice because the New York real estate developer was unfit for the presidency. It went on to list and expand on eight reasons for its stance, including: He is ill-equipped to be commander in chief, He traffics in prejudice, and Hes a serial liar. Trumps foreign policy pronouncements typically range from uninformed to incoherent, the editorial said. In an opinion piece on the USA Today website, Trumps running mate Mike Pence wrote that the New York businessman was thoughtful, compassionate and steady... I know he is ready to lead the United States as our next president and commander in chief. Trump and Clinton are locked in a close race for the Nov. 8 election. A majority of Americans say Clinton won their first presidential debate on Monday, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll. USA Today, published by Gannett Co Inc, said its editorial board was divided on Clinton, and some of the reservations about the former secretary of state centered on her sense of entitlement, her lack of candor and her extreme carelessness in handling classified information.

Suing governments over terror no sure thing despite U.S. September 11 law,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Families of Sept. 11 victims and others who may seek to sue foreign governments accused of supporting terrorism in the United States still face significant legal hurdles, despite a boost from passage of a law allowing such cases to proceed.  The new Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, grants an exception to the legal principle of sovereign immunity in cases of terrorism on U.S. soil.  Passage of the law over a presidential veto could allow relatives and survivors of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to move forward with a case they filed more than a decade ago against Saudi Arabia in New York federal court. Still, it will be hard to prove a foreign nation is responsible for acts of terrorism, said attorneys and professors with expertise in international law, who expected drawn-out legal wrangling. We may find that at the end of the day, after years of litigation, that the link is not sufficiently established even for Saudi Arabia, said Curtis Bradley, a law professor at Duke University.  The law says plaintiffs must show the foreign state knowingly or recklessly provided material support or resources to designated terrorist groups, not that the countries were simply negligent or looked the other way.  Congress on Wednesday overwhelming voted to pass the law, overturning President Barack Obamas veto. Before the law, American victims of terrorist acts could only sue countries designated by the U.S. State Department as state-sponsors of terrorism, currently Iran, Syria and Sudan. Now, any country can be sued if there are allegations of support for known terrorists that carry out attacks on U.S. soil.  Existing tort law requires plaintiffs to prove that support played a substantial factor in the victims injuries, a high bar, said Jimmy Gurule an expert in international criminal law at the University of Notre Dame.    This could be challenging in the Sept. 11 case since an independent commission on the 2001 attacks did not find sufficient evidence of Saudi involvement. Al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attacks and most of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals.  We have a high degree of confidence we can meet that burden. The Saudis think we cant, said Jack Quinn, co-counsel for more than 2,000 family members of Sept. 11 victims.  The families sued Saudi Arabia in 2003, seeking to hold the country responsible. The proceedings have been stalled on the question of Saudi Arabias immunity Quinn said the plaintiffs will now ask the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider the issue in light of the new law.  If the court says the case can move forward, both sides will use discovery to seek documents and take depositions of witnesses and experts.  We will next attempt to complete the development of evidence and find out what the truth is and on the basis of that, let the chips fall as they may, said Quinn.   But even under the new law, the White House can still request a court to halt this and other potential lawsuits. The law allows a court to put a proceeding against a foreign state on hold if the United States says it is engaged in good faith discussions with the country to resolve the claims.  The stay provision and other changes were added to address concerns raised by the White House, Saudi Arabia and companies like General Electric and Dow Chemical Co. Obama is likely to request such a stay, said Bradley. Stephen Vladeckof the University of Texas School of Law, said this revision and others injected uncertainty into the law and could result in litigation aimed at clarifying the bills language. The next step in this is either a whole bunch of lawsuits being placed on indefinite hold or a whole bunch of litigation to figure out the meaning of all these obstacles that Congress snuck back into the bill at the last minute, said Vladeck. Even with the revisions, detractors of the new law worried that it could inspire other countries to retaliate by enacting their own statutes that could drag the United States or U.S. companies into court. Some U.S. lawmakers said Congress may revisit the law to narrow it further.  Ultimately, though, if the victims of terrorist acts win a court  judgment against a foreign government, other cases have shown that collecting damages can be a slog. A Reuters analysis last year found that in the 10 years following the Sept. 11 attacks, the number of lawsuits filed under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act and similar laws more than tripled compared to the decade before with plaintiffs winning billions of dollars worth of judgments in U.S. courts.  But judgments awarded against organizations or governments are often unenforceable and even when there are assets that can be claimed in the United States, their value often falls short of the award.

U.S. to open new vetting agency for 'secret' security clearances,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government will open the doors next week to a new agency, with stronger data protections, meant to shorten by many weeks the time it takes to vet government workers seeking secret and top secret security clearances. The National Background Investigations Bureau will be headed by Charles Phalen, who has worked as a security executive at the CIA, the FBI and defense contractor Northrop Grumman, officials said on Thursday on a conference call with reporters. The bureau will replace an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) clearance system that was hit by hackers who stole potentially sensitive personal data on as many as 22 million people, including government employees and job applicants. Phalen and OPM Director Beth Cobert said a top priority for the bureau will be shortening delays in the clearance process, which can hold up the hiring of government employees for months. Cobert said that OPM figures show on average the time required to complete an investigation for a secret level security clearance is now 120 days; for a top secret clearance, it is 170 days on average. These timelines are well too long, Phelan acknowledged. Cobert said the new agencys goal would be to reduce the time for completing a secret clearance to 40 days and to cut the time for a top secret investigation to 80 days. Officials said that individual government agencies, rather than the new central investigations bureau, would be responsible for social media checks of security clearance applicants.  Officials said that the new bureau would still depend on outside contractors, especially for hiring field investigators. The new agency will employ 2,500 government workers and 6,000 contract employees, officials said. ",politicsNews,"September 29, 2016 ",1
"Kansas, ACLU reach temporary agreement on voter ID","(Reuters) - The Kansas Secretary of State and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have reached a temporary agreement over the states voter registration laws, keeping Kansas chief elections officer from a contempt of court hearing, according to court documents filed on Thursday. The deal between Secretary of State Kris Kobach and the ACLU comes six weeks before the U.S. presidential election. The two sides have been at odds over a Kansas law requiring people to prove American citizenship if they want to register to vote while applying for a drivers license. Critics say this requirement disenfranchises voters, especially minorities. The deal will allow people who registered at motor vehicle offices or with a federal form without providing citizenship documents to vote in the Nov. 8 election with a standard ballot, rather than be forced to use a provisional one, the ACLU and Kobach said in a status report filed on Thursday. Kobach will also clarify his offices website to help voters find information more easily, according to the report filed to U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson.  Robinson had ordered Kobach, a Republican, to explain by Thursday why he should not be held in contempt for failing to obey a federal order issued in May.  That order required him to register people who applied to vote at motor vehicle offices or with a federal form without proof of citizenship. Robinson canceled the contempt hearing scheduled for Friday, according to her own court filing, citing the ACLU and Kobachs agreement.  Our case is ongoing, but this interim agreement is a critical victory for Kansans who want to vote in the November election. It is a shame that voters had to fight so hard to get Kris Kobach to do his job, ACLU attorney Orion Danjuma said in a statement. Kobach said he was pleased an agreement had been reached, but criticized the ACLU.  The ACLUs argument was weak at best. However, at this point the preparations for the November 8, 2016, general election must proceed with rules established to ensure the efficient administration of the election, he said in a statement.  Kansas law, among the strictest voter identification statutes in the country, is defended by Republicans who say the rules are meant to prevent voter fraud.  On Tuesday, a Kansas state judge issued a separate ruling extending voting rights through the Nov. 8 election of about 17,500 people who registered to vote at motor vehicle offices.

Majority of Americans say Clinton won first debate against Trump: Reuters/Ipsos poll," NEW YORK (Reuters) - A majority of Americans say Democrat Hillary Clinton won Monday nights presidential debate, but her performance doesnt appear to have immediately boosted her support among likely voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll released on Wednesday.  The online poll, which gathered responses from more than 2,000 people on Tuesday, found 56 percent of American adults felt that Clinton did a better job than Trump in the first of their three televised debates, compared with 26 percent who felt that Trump did better.  Of those who thought Clinton emerged the victor, 85 percent were Democrats and 22 percent were Republicans.  U.S. presidential debates have historically been seen as a crucial test of candidates poise and policies. Mondays was watched by a record 84 million viewers and was billed as a rare prime-time opportunity for two unpopular candidates to convince millions of undecided voters to back them.  Afterward, both candidates claimed victory.  Every single online poll had me winning, Trump said at a campaign stop in Council Bluffs, Iowa on Wednesday. You sit back and you hear how well she did in the debate. I dont think she did well at all.  Clinton campaign spokesman Jesse Ferguson said the Democrat clearly won the debate as Trump was unprepared, became unhinged and was incoherent throughout.  Among those who are expected to take part in the Nov. 8 general election, 34 percent said they felt that the debate changed their view of Clinton in a positive way, compared with 19 percent who said the same of Trump.  Some 31 percent of likely voters said the debate improved Clintons chances of winning the White House, while 16 percent said the debate benefited Trump.  Even so, Clintons performance seemed to have little impact on her support among Americas likely voters. The poll showed 42 percent supported Clinton while 38 percent supported Trump. Over the past few weeks Clinton has maintained a lead of between 4 and 6 points over Trump.  Narrowing the focus to likely voters who watched the debate, Clinton led Trump 44 percent to 39 percent.  One possible reason for the lack of movement in her support is that it usually takes several days to measure the full impact of a single event, like a debate, said Donald Green, a political scientist at Columbia University.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted every day in English in all 50 states. Mondays sample of 2,036 American adults included 1,336 people who were considered to be likely voters from their voting record, registration status and stated intention to vote in the election. Among those likely voters, 1,026 said they watched some portion of the debate on live TV, online or in media clips that were circulated after the debate.  The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire sample and the sample of likely voters. It has a credibility interval of 4 percentage points for the likely voters who watched the debate.  National opinion polls have differed this year in how they measure support for Clinton and Trump. Some polls, like Reuters/Ipsos, try to include only likely voters, while others include all registered voters. The Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll gathers responses every day and reports results twice a week, so it often detects trends in sentiment before most other polls.  Polling aggregators, which calculate averages of major polls, have shown that Clintons lead over Trump has been shrinking this month to about 2 percentage points.

"If elected, Clinton under pressure to appoint tough Wall Street sheriffs","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic Party progressives intent on reining in Wall Street are pushing Hillary Clinton to choose people to head the Treasury, SEC and other agencies who will crack down on big banks if she wins the White House on Nov. 8. Do they have a proven track record of challenging corporate power? asked Adam Green of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a grassroots group aligned with U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the partys liberal firebrand. In meetings with Clintons team, progressive groups are urging that she break sharply with the centrist, pro-business bent of some of the economic leaders who served her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and President Barack Obama. Big U.S. banks are voicing concern about both Clinton and Donald Trump, her Republican rival who has accused corporate America of buying influence in Washington. Among Democratic progressives, a favorite for Treasury secretary is Sarah Bloom Raskin, now deputy Treasury secretary and a backer of strict enforcement of the Volcker Rule that prohibits banks from making some types of speculative investments. I view proprietary trading as an activity of low or no real economic value that should not be part of any banking model that has an implicit government backstop, Raskin, then a Federal Reserve governor, said in a 2012 speech. Democratic activists, who believe Obama did not go far enough at the height of the 2007-2009 financial crisis to punish bankers and tighten regulation, want to make sure Clinton keeps her campaign promises to defend the 2010 Dodd-Frank reforms and build on them to curb Wall Streets excesses. Progressive priorities include ensuring the U.S. Justice Department pursues criminal cases against bankers, not just institutions. Some Democratic activists are wary of two potential  Treasury candidates - Sheryl Sandberg, Facebooks chief operating officer, and Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard - because of links to the Bill Clinton and Obama administrations. Sandberg was chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Larry Summers in Bill Clintons administration and Brainard was a top lieutenant to Timothy Geithner, Obamas first Treasury secretary.      Locked in a tight race with Trump, Clinton has said little about any future appointments. Her spokesman, Brian Fallon, said any speculation about personnel is entirely premature as Clinton is focusing on winning the election. She has no obligation to heed the advice of progressives like Warren or Bernie Sanders, who challenged Clinton for the Democratic nomination. But Clinton risks a damaging intraparty rift early in her White House tenure if she ignores them. Kara Stein, a commissioner on the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and co-author of a book warning of the dangers posed by big financial institutions, are progressive favorites for SEC chair. Progressives also favor Gary Gensler, an adviser to Hillary Clinton, for a senior administration role because of his reputation as a tough regulator when he headed the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the Obama administration. Jeff Hauser, director of the Revolving Door Project at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, said progressives have a broad feeling of regret that they did not exert more pressure on Obama to name officials committed to bold financial regulatory reforms. It wasnt so much that progressives lost, its that they didnt understand the stakes at the time and didnt get into the game until it was too late, Hauser said. Warren, who would have a big microphone in any potential fight over U.S. Senate confirmation of nominees, in a speech last week at the Center for American Progress, warned Clinton against choosing people who work at big investment banks. When we talk about personnel, we dont mean advisers who just pay lip service to Hillarys bold agenda, coupled with a sigh, a knowing glance, and a twiddling of thumbs until its time for the next swing through the revolving door, serving government then going back to the very same industries they regulate, she said. The New York-based Roosevelt Institute think tank is seeking lesser-known candidates, some outside Washington, for at least 120 administration jobs. Their potential candidates include state attorneys general who have taken on for-profit colleges and handled large mortgage settlements. ",politicsNews,"September 29, 2016 ",1

"U.S. 9/11 law exasperates Saudis, government silent","RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - A U.S. law allowing lawsuits against Saudi Arabia over the Sept. 11 attacks met a stony silence from Riyadh on Thursday but some Saudis bristled, saying the kingdom should curb business and security ties in response. The Senate and House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to approve legislation that will allow the families of those killed in the 2001 attacks on the United States to seek damages from the Saudi government. Riyadh has always dismissed suspicions that it backed the attackers, who killed nearly 3,000 people under the banner of Islamist militant group al Qaeda. Fifteen out of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals.  The Saudi government financed an extensive lobbying campaign against the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, in the run-up to the vote, and warned it would undermine the principle of sovereign immunity. But Saudi officials who had lobbied against the bill stopped short of threatening any retaliation if the law was passed. There was no official reaction from Saudi Arabia after the votes, and in the short-term, few expect little more than a curt statement of disapproval from Riyadh. The long-standing alliance between the kingdom and the United States is one of the cornerstones of Middle East politics, security and trade, and in their reactions on Thursday some Saudis said JASTA would jeopardize what they see as an interdependent relationship.   What would happen if Saudi Arabia froze its cooperation with the United States with regards to counter-terrorism as a response to JASTA? Salman al-Dosary, editor-in-chief of the pan-Arab, Saudi-owned Al Sharq al-Awsat newspaper, wrote on Twitter. The Saudi riyal fell against the U.S. dollar in the forward foreign exchange market on Thursday after the bill was passed, prompting a drop in dollar demand in Riyadh. People are reluctant to buy dollars ... because of the price, said Raed al-Sayari, whose family runs an exchange shop in a bustling commercial district popular with foreign workers. Were concerned that if the dollar keeps appreciating and the situation doesnt stabilize in the coming days there will be no demand. This would be a big loss for the market. The Saudi riyal SAR= is pegged at 3.75 to the dollar in the spot market, but banks often use the forwards market to hedge against risks. Some analysts argue the Al Saud ruling family will interpret the move as political expedience by lawmakers in a U.S. election season and that the chances of a successful lawsuit are uncertain at best. But the measure does nothing to ease long-standing friction in the alliance: President Barack Obama, who had vetoed JASTA but was overridden by Congress, is increasingly seen by the kingdom and fellow Gulf Arab as favoring their bitter rival Iran, a charge Washington denies, and differs with Riyadh over Syria and other Arab crises. This bill reflects an anti-Saudi campaign.It is time to see less of America in our midst, said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a political scientist in the United Arab Emirates. Some analysts have speculated that Riyadh could retaliate by curbing U.S. trade with the biggest Arab economy or restrict cooperation on security, a crucial relationship for U.S. counter-terrorism and for peace efforts in Arab conflicts. Theodore Karasik, of Gulf State Analytics, wrote on al Arabiya website that JASTA would ignite a firestorm of legal warfare that will directly undermine political relationships at a time when robust ties to fight terrorism is required. He said the measure could also disrupt sweeping economic reforms meant to boost the private sector and foreign investment and wean the kingdom off oil dependence.  Some analysts speculated that bilateral trade and investment could be hurt. The kingdom owns $96.5 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds, and is believed to hold at least that sum in other U.S. assets and bank accounts. ",politicsNews,"September 29, 2016 ",1
Passage of September 11 lawsuit bill an 'abject embarrassment': White House,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Thursday that Congresss passage of a law allowing Sept. 11-related suits against Saudi Arabia was an abject embarrassment and that the administration was willing to talk to lawmakers about narrowing the measures impact. I think what weve seen in the United States Congress is a pretty classic case of rapid onset buyers remorse, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told a briefing, noting that 28 senators had written a letter expressing concern about the measure within minutes of voting to override President Barack Obamas veto.

Congress on Wednesday overwhelmingly rejected President Barack Obamas veto of the legislation. ",politicsNews,"September 29, 2016 ",1
"Saudi riyal falls, bond may be delayed after U.S. Congress vote","DUBAI (Reuters) - The Saudi riyal fell against the U.S. dollar in the forward foreign exchange market on Thursday after the U.S. Congress voted to allow relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia.  Any legal action could take years to wind through the U.S. court system, and analysts said there might be little if any impact on the Saudi economy or state finances. But the decision by Congress was an unwelcome reminder of political and financial pressures on Riyadh as low oil prices strain its budget. Saudi Arabia has been preparing to make its first international issue of sovereign bonds next month to raise $10 billion or more, but some Gulf bankers said the issue might now be delayed to give investors time to digest the news. Similarly, the legal threat could make Riyadh less likely to choose New York for a listing of shares in national oil giant Saudi Aramco. An offer of Aramco shares is expected as soon as 2017, possibly raising tens of billions of dollars, and Saudi officials have said they are considering several foreign bourses. The Senate and House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to override President Barack Obamas veto of legislation granting an exception to the legal principle of sovereign immunity in cases of terrorism on U.S. soil. This clears the way for attempts to seek damages from the Saudi government. Riyadh has denied longstanding suspicions that it backed the hijackers who attacked the United States in 2001. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals. One-year dollar/riyal forwards, which are trades scheduled to take place 12 months from now, were at 550 points early on Thursday, up from Wednesdays close of 330 points. They rose as far as an eight-week high of 625 points. The Saudi riyal is pegged at 3.75 to the dollar in the spot market, so banks often use the forwards market to hedge against risks. In the short term you might have volatility but the legislation will take a decade to have a result, so markets will calm down, predicted a banker involved in Gulf currency trade, adding the main impact might be to saddle the Saudi government with tens of millions of dollars in annual legal fees. Five-year Saudi credit default swaps, used to insure against the risk of a sovereign debt default, rose slightly to 157 points from 152, and the Saudi stock market fell slightly. But the price of state-run Saudi Electricity Cos April 2023 dollar Islamic bond, one of the few outstanding international bonds from Saudi Arabia, did not move significantly. Some analysts speculated that trade and investment ties between Saudi Arabia and the United States could be hurt. The kingdom owns $96.5 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds, according to the latest official U.S. data, and is believed to hold at least that sum in other U.S. assets and bank accounts. From a Saudi foreign ministry perspective, there will be a review of investment policy and that could move the kingdom down a different path, which could include diversification away from U.S. Treasuries, the Gulf banker said. In May, Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir said the proposed U.S. law would cause an erosion of investor confidence in the United States, though he added that Riyadh was not threatening to pull its money out of the country. Riyadh has been selling several billion dollars in U.S. bonds each month to cover its budget deficit, and bankers think it is unlikely to step this up as a result of the Congress vote. That is because few other markets or currencies provide the combination of liquidity and security of the $13 trillion U.S. Treasury market. Saudi Arabia has also been eagerly courting investment by top U.S. companies such as General Electric Co to help diversify its economy beyond oil, and a trade or investment war with the United States could damage its economic reform drive. The U.S. is a market where the Saudis will continue to invest. I dont think theyll adopt a knee-jerk reaction to their investments, said John Sfakianakis, economist with the Jeddah-based Gulf Research Centre. If it makes sense, they will continue to keep their assets in the United States. ",politicsNews,"September 29, 2016 ",1
Congress passes funding bill averting government shutdown,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress approved a stop-gap funding bill on Wednesday that averts a looming federal government shutdown and provides urgently needed money to help battle an outbreak of the Zika virus. Passage of the bipartisan legislation came shortly after Republicans and Democrats ended a months-long fight over whether Washington should provide aid to the city of Flint, Michigan, as it struggles with a crisis over contaminated drinking water. Separate legislation was approved by the House of Representatives earlier in the day setting aid for Flint. It must now be reconciled with a somewhat different bill passed by the Senate.   The House voted 342-85 in a late-night session on Wednesday to approve stop-gap funding to keep the U.S. government operating from Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year, until Dec. 9, when lawmakers will attempt to approve longer-term money. With existing funds due to expire on Saturday, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers said the legislation is a last resort, but at this point it is what we must do ... to keep the lights on in our government. The Senate voted 72-26 earlier on Wednesday to adopt the short-term spending bill. Besides providing money to keep the government operating, the legislation also contains $1.1 billion to battle the Zika virus that has hit Puerto Rico hard and spread to U.S. states, most notably Florida. The disease can cause severe birth defects. Funds would be used to develop a vaccine and reduce Zika exposure. The bill also includes $500 million for flood relief in Louisiana and other states. In a series of carefully orchestrated maneuvers after the Senate approved the temporary funding, the House passed a wide-ranging water resources bill containing $170 million to assist Flint by a vote of 399-25. Democrats have demanded action on the crisis, which stems from dangerous levels of lead in Flints drinking water. A Senate version of the bill contains $220 million for Flint and other cities with problem water systems. The two chambers will have to hammer out compromise legislation after the Nov. 8 presidential and congressional elections. Wednesdays flurry of activity in Congress came as lawmakers rushed to recess this week until after the elections.        Conservative groups urged Congress to defeat the funding bill. However, with House and Senate members facing an imminent deadline for approving new money and lawmakers eager to go home to campaign for re-election, the measure moved quickly through Congress on Wednesday. The White House said it was disappointed that the temporary funding bill continued a provision barring the Securities and Exchange Commission from taking action to increase transparency in public companies political spending. It also expressed disappointment that Congress failed to take steps to ensure that the Export-Import Bank was able to fully operate its loan guarantee programs. Nevertheless, President Barack Obama is expected to sign the bill into law. ",politicsNews,"September 28, 2016 ",1

Clinton enlists former foe Sanders in appeal for youth votes in U.S. presidential race,"DURHAM, N.H. (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton shared a stage with former rival Senator Bernie Sanders on Wednesday to appeal for youth votes in the Nov. 8 election as opinion polls show a close race with Republican Donald Trump. Clinton told an audience at the University of New Hampshire that she would make college affordable if she wins the White House, the kind of promise that won Sanders many young supporters during the Democratic nominating contest.       We should and we will make public colleges tuition-free for families earning less than $125,000 a year, Clinton said. She vowed to help those who already have student debt to refinance. Clintons campaign is worried that some polls show voters under the age of 30 might not turn out in great numbers at polling stations in November, potentially giving an advantage to Trump. Members of the crowd on Wednesday waved signs that read: I will vote. Recent opinion polls have shown the race tightening between Clinton, a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady, and Trump, a New York real estate magnate.  A majority of Americans say Clinton won Monday nights presidential debate, but her performance does not appear to have boosted support among likely voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll released on Wednesday. The online poll found that 56 percent of American adults felt Clinton did a better job, compared with 26 percent who believed the Republican did better. Even so, Clintons performance seemed to have little impact on her support. The poll showed 42 percent supported her, while 38 percent backed Trump.  Trump, often described as racist by Clinton, tried to turn the tables at a rally in Waukesha, Wisconsin. He pointed to the Democrats remark that implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just the police, when asked at the debate whether she believed police are implicitly biased against black people. She accuses the entire country, including all of law enforcement, of implicit bias, essentially suggesting that everyone, including our police, are basically racist and prejudiced, Trump said. Clintons event with Sanders took place on a university campus, but it was not open to students without an invitation, according to attendees, many of whom were middle-aged and said they were members of local Democratic organizations or invited by the campaign. Clinton praised Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who was her opponent in the hard-fought struggle for the Democratic nomination earlier this year. He is one of the most passionate champions for equality and justice that I have ever seen and someone that I am looking forward to working with, Clinton said of Sanders, who introduced her on Wednesday. Although Sanders lost to Clinton, he consistently drew younger voters to his side with promises to take on Wall Street, make college less expensive and close the income gap. He called on young people in New Hampshire, a swing state in the presidential election, to get behind Clinton. Get your uncles, your aunts, get your friends to vote for Hillary Clinton, he said. Clintons campaign said it hoped to get Sanders to make more appearances on Clintons behalf before the election.  ",politicsNews,"September 28, 2016 ",1
"U.S Treasury’s Lew says Colombia peace deal to boost investment, unlock new aid","BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombias peace deal with the Marxist FARC rebel group will bring more investment to the country, backed partly by new donor aid and loans from multilateral development banks, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and his Colombian counterpart said on Wednesday.     Lew told a news conference in Bogota that the peace accord, signed on Monday and set to be voted on by the Colombian people on Sunday, would add to the confidence of foreign investors in Colombia. The 52-year war killed 220,000 people and left millions displaced.     Implementing the agreement, showing that Colombia has a stable future, I think will make Colombia a more attractive place for foreign investment, Lew said after meeting with Colombian Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas and President Juan Manuel Santos.      He said Santos government already had an excellent reputation among foreign investors for sound management of fiscal policy and pursuit of economic reforms, despite major challenges from low oil prices. Cardenas said the peace accord would attract both domestic and foreign investment and spur new spending on infrastructure and schools in former conflict areas. He declined to specify amounts but previously estimated that peace with FARC could boost Colombias economic growth by 1 percentage point annually.      It will be at the initial stages, more tourism. Thats one of the areas we think the agreement will have the most direct and immediate impact, Cardenas said. We will be able also to secure additional funding through cooperation, donors and lending by multilaterals to support expenditures and investments in the rural communities where the conflict was most acute.     Former FARC fighters are already making plans for eco-tourism ventures and cheesemaking operations in vast jungles largely untouched for decades. The peace deal gives FARC a voice in Colombias political process. Cardenas said that put the group in the competition for ideas but would not alter the center-right governments economic reform plan, which thinks that one of the pillars of the success of any country is having low inflation, low fiscal deficit, low debt, and at the same time having a progressive agenda.          Lew said the United States was still committed to providing bilateral aid to Colombia and that he and Cardenas discussed opportunities to gain support from multilateral institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank.

U.S. senator: 'Unlikely' Cuba ambassador will be approved this year,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which oversees the confirmation of foreign service nominees, said on Wednesday it was highly unlikely that an ambassador to Cuba would be approved this year. President Barack Obama on Tuesday nominated career diplomat Jeffrey DeLaurentis to be the first U.S. ambassador to Cuba in more than five decades. The committee was notified of the nomination yesterday but has not yet received the appropriate paperwork to begin its work, Republican Senator Bob Corker said in a statement emailed to Reuters. However, it is highly unlikely that an ambassador to Cuba would be approved in the lame-duck. The appointment of DeLaurentis, the top American official at the U.S. embassy in Havana, marked Obamas latest move to go as far as he can in normalizing ties between the former Cold War foes before he leaves office in January. But the nomination must be approved by the Republican-controlled Senate, which is seen as a long shot. Corkers committee would have to hold a confirmation hearing for DeLaurentis and vote to approve his nomination before it would go to the full Senate, where it could be blocked by any senator. Many lawmakers have warmly embraced Obamas moves toward more normal relations with Cuba, which became public in a shock announcement in December 2014. But several strongly oppose his efforts, arguing that Cuba must do far more to improve human rights before it can deal normally with the United States. Cuban-American senators such as Republicans Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz and Democrat Robert Menendez are particularly opposed to Obamas policy. Rubio and Menendez are both members of the foreign relations panel. Congress lame-duck session takes place in November and December, after the elections on Nov. 8 and before the new Congress comes to Washington in January. ",politicsNews,"September 29, 2016 ",1
U.S. agency told Mylan that EpiPen was misclassified,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. federal health agency said on Wednesday it had expressly advised Mylan NV (MYL.O) that the drugmaker had improperly classified its EpiPen emergency allergy treatment in a way that allowed it to pay lower rebates to state health programs. The disclosure comes as U.S. lawmakers and prosecutors are investigating Mylan over steep price hikes for the EpiPen device which have rendered the drug unaffordable for a growing number of families. A least one state has launched an investigation into whether Mylan failed to pay proper rebates to the Medicaid program for the poor. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, said in a statement it had on multiple occasions, provided guidance to the industry and Mylan on the proper classification of drugs and has expressly advised Mylan that their classification of EpiPen for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate program was incorrect. CMS, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, declined to say what action it took to push for the misclassification to be corrected or when it spoke to Mylan. Mylan classified EpiPen with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program as a generic treatment, which provides a rebate of 13 percent to state Medicaid programs, rather than as a branded drug, which pays a minimum rebate of 23.1 percent.  Mylan has said it complied with CMS rules. The company did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the CMS statement. Mylan has been heavily criticized for sharply raising the price of EpiPen devices, which are carried by people with life-threatening allergies. Mylan acquired the product in 2007 and has raised the list price for a pair of EpiPens to $600 from about $100 in 2008. Earlier on Wednesday, U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal, Charles Grassley and Amy Klobuchar asked the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate a possible misclassification. The facts ... suggest that Mylan may have knowingly misclassified EpiPens, potentially in violation of the False Claims Act and other statutes, the lawmakers said in a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The False Claims Act is used to pursue companies that defraud the federal government. ",politicsNews,"September 28, 2016 ",1
"Forbes pegs Trump's wealth at $3.7 billion, $800 million less than last year","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps estimated net worth is $3.7 billion, $800 million less than a year ago, Forbes magazine reported on Wednesday, attributing the loss largely to New Yorks softening real estate market.  The magazine probed 28 assets or asset classes owned by the New York businessman and found 18 had declined in value,  including Trump Tower in Manhattan and his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.  The value of his 40 Wall Street property in downtown New York had also declined, according to Forbes, which said it has been tracking Trumps wealth for 34 years.  At the same time, one asset remained steady while seven others - including 555 California Street, the second tallest building in San Francisco - saw their value increase, it reported.  Representatives for the Trump campaign could not be immediately reached for comment.  The report comes as Trump, known as a reality television star as well as for his real estate business, heads into the final stretch of campaigning for the Nov. 8 election. Trump, seeking elected office for the first time, has touted his business acumen in pressing for change in Washington. He has vowed to rip up trade deals, negotiate with allies to make them pay more for their U.S. defense protection, and have Mexico pay for a wall he has proposed along the southern U.S. border. If elected, he would be the first billionaire to serve as president, according to Forbes.  Details of Trumps wealth are not publicly known because, bucking a decades-old tradition of U.S. presidential candidates, he has refused to release his tax returns. His Democratic rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, earned $10.75 million in 2015 alongside her husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, their tax filing showed. Clinton and others, including some prominent Republicans, have pressed Trump to release his returns. They have also raised questions about his net worth as well as his charitable contributions and business ties.  Forbes said its analysis did not place any value on Trumps brand. It also disputed Trumps assertion in Monday nights  presidential debate that he reported $694 million in income from last year to the Federal Election Commission. Forbes said Trump mixed revenue and income in the document. Trump has so far given $54 million to his presidential campaign. His campaign has also paid his companies for office space in Trump Tower and use of his private airline, among other expenses, federal election filings have shown. Politico reported separately on Wednesday that Trump is considering giving more money to his campaign to fund an advertising blitz, citing three sources close to him. Amid the campaign, Trump made just one real estate deal in the past year: purchasing a Charleston, South Carolina, warehouse that was in foreclosure, Forbes said.

"California, eyeing Cosby, ends statute of limitations for rape","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown on Wednesday signed a bill to end the statute of limitations for rape, a measure inspired by accusations against comedian Bill Cosby, some of which surfaced decades after alleged crimes occurred. Cosby, who built a long career on family friendly comedy, including his long-running NBC sitcom The Cosby Show, has steadfastly denied ever assaulting anyone and has insisted that all his sexual encounters were consensual. He is charged in Pennsylvania with drugging and sexually assaulting a former Temple University employee, Andrea Constand, at his home in 2004. In California, he faces a civil suit by a woman now in her 50s who alleges that Cosby plied her with alcohol and molested her in 1974 at the Playboy Mansion when she was aged 15. Existing California law generally limits prosecution of a felony sexual offense to 10 years after the offense is committed. Only two in 100 rapists will be convicted of a felony and spend any time in prison, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.  Governor Jerry Browns signature of SB 813 tells every rape and sexual assault victim in California that they matter and that, regardless of when they are ready to come forward, they will always have an opportunity to seek justice in a court of law, said bill author Senator Connie Leyva.  Rapists should never be able to evade legal consequences simply because an arbitrary time limit has expired, she said. The bill will not work retroactively and will not help some of Cosbys accusers, according to Gloria Allred, an attorney who represents several of the comedians alleged victims.  The governors of Nevada and Colorado have signed similar bills extending the statute of limitations to 20 years  for rape cases into law.  The California law takes effect on Jan. 1, 2017.

'Bridgegate' witness casts more doubt on NJ Governor Christie's denials,"NEWARK, N.J. (Reuters) - In December 2013, as the Bridgegate scandal was unraveling, New Jersey Governor Chris Christies chief spokesman learned the truth: that lanes had been closed at the George Washington Bridge to punish a local mayor for political reasons. That was the testimony from former Port Authority of New York and New Jersey executive David Wildstein on Wednesday, who told jurors in Newark federal court he informed Christies press secretary Michael Drewniak that he executed the scheme with the approval of Christie aides. Wildstein has said several key figures in Christies inner circle knew about the plot as it was occurring or soon afterward - including Christie himself, who was told of the closures by Wildstein as they unfolded in September 2013, according to Wildsteins testimony on Tuesday. Christie, who is not accused of wrongdoing, has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the plot at the time, but Wildsteins testimony has bolstered the governments assertion the governor knew about the scandal earlier than he has acknowledged.  The scandal helped derail Christies bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and could endanger his best chance at a political future: a role in Donald Trumps administration should the Republican presidential candidate win a Nov. 8 election. The governors former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, and a former Port Authority executive, Bill Baroni, are charged with deliberately creating gridlock in Fort Lee, New Jersey, after the towns mayor declined to endorse Christies 2013 re-election bid. Wildstein said on Wednesday he met with Drewniak on Dec. 4 and offered to resign. I told him the stories were out of control, Wildstein said. This wasnt going away. Drewniak has previously confirmed that Wildstein told him of the closures, but has denied knowing it was political payback. Wildstein also said he met with Christies chief counsel, Charlie McKenna, two days later and told him about the scheme, though he did not say whether he disclosed the motivation for the plot. Wildstein previously said he informed Michael DuHaime, a Christie adviser, in November. He has also testified that Christies campaign manager, Bill Stepien; David Samson, the chairman of the Port Authority; and a board member, Pat Schuber, were aware of the plot beforehand. Stepiens lawyer has said he had no role in the scheme, while Samson and Schuber have denied advance knowledge. Defense lawyers began questioning Wildstein on Wednesday and sought to portray him as the true mastermind of the scheme, even though Baroni was nominally his superior. Michael Baldassare, a lawyer for Baroni, also suggested Wildsteins testimony was biased because he is seeking a reduced sentence after pleading guilty to two counts of conspiracy.

New Hampshire 'ballot selfie' ban unconstitutional: appeals court,"BOSTON (Reuters) - A 2014 New Hampshire law prohibiting voters from taking selfies with their ballots on election day is an unconstitutional infringement on the right to free speech, a federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday. The New England state had banned the practice, which has become a popular way for voters to show support for favored candidates, claiming that it would set the stage for a return of the vote-buying scandals that rocked many U.S. states in the 19th century. Three New Hampshire citizens, including a man who wrote in the name of his dog to express dismay at his choices in the 2014 Republican primary for the U.S. Senate, sued the state that year claiming the measure violated their rights to free expression, as protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A federal court in New Hampshire sided with them, but the state appealed, making its case in Boston just two weeks ago. The appeals court swiftly rejected its arguments. The statutes purposes cannot justify the restrictions it imposes on speech, Circuit Judge Sandra Lynch wrote in the courts decision. New Hampshires argument that ballot selfies could lead to people selling their votes or being compelled by their employers to vote in a certain way fell short in no small part because the state had no evidence of that actually happening, Lynch wrote. The legislative history of the bill does not contain any corroborated evidence of vote buying or voter coercion in New Hampshire during the 20th and 21st centuries, she wrote. Digital photography, the internet, and social media are not unknown quantities  they have been ubiquitous for several election cycles, without being shown to have the effect of furthering vote buying or voter intimidation. Lynch also noted that several federal and state laws in effect in New Hampshire already make it illegal to buy or sell a vote, which would allow prosecutors to take on allegations of election tampering even in an environment where selfies were permitted. Other states, including nearby Rhode Island, have passed laws explicitly allowing ballot selfies, partly reasoning that the trend has helped younger voters show their enthusiasm for the democratic process.

Michigan Attorney General says weak Detroit schools can be closed,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Underperforming schools in the cash-strapped city of Detroit can be closed this school year, Michigans Attorney General said in a legal opinion issued Wednesday to clarify an existing state law.  The position is the latest development in a battle between the states Republican and Democratic lawmakers over how best to address Detroits struggling school system.    Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Republican, said schools operated by the Detroit Public School Community District that are among the lowest achieving 5 percent of all public schools during the three preceding school years can be shuttered by the states School Reform Officer (SRO). Republican Governor Rick Snyder, who in June approved a dramatic restructuring of Detroits school system, previously accepted the opinion of an outside law firm that the SRO could not close schools until 2019, according to the Detroit Free Press.   The law is clear: Michigan parents and their children do not have to be stuck indefinitely in a failing school, Schuette said in a statement on Wednesday.  Detroit students and parents deserve accountability and high performing schools. If a child cant spell opportunity, they wont have opportunity.  Some Democrats argue that the newly restructured school district needs additional time to re-evaluate the performance of schools and integrate best learning practices.  Schuettes opinion said the SRO could issue a mandatory notice of closure to a school, which would then determine the best time to close before the end of the current school term.   If a school is closed, students will be re-assigned to another school.  The Detroit public school system, which has nearly 46,000 students, has been under state control since 2009 because of a financial emergency.  Of the 124 worst-performing schools in the state, 47 are Detroit public schools, according to a list released by the SRO earlier this month.  The recent restructuring of the school system splits it into two distinct parts in an effort to improve the academically and financially struggling system.  Ari Adler, a spokesman for Snyders office, said on Wednesday that the governors office was reviewing Schuettes legal opinion.  Republican House Speaker Kevin Cotter, who asked for a clarification of the law from Schuette welcomed the decision on Wednesday.  Detroit students need a final decision, and this opinion provides one, Cotter said in a statement.  State Representative Sherry Gay-Dagnogo, a Democrat representing northwest Detroit, slammed Schuettes opinion, describing the attorney general as totally out of touch with the needs of our community.

Illinois attorney general appeals bar on Election Day voter registration,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Illinois Attorney General has appealed a federal judge ruling that blocks same-day registration at polling places in the states most populous counties, a spokeswoman for the office said on Wednesday.  The appeal submitted by the states Attorney General, Lisa Madigan, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, seeks to reverse a ruling that bars Election Day voter registration at polling places in counties with populations of 100,000 or more. Such registrations were allowed under a state law enacted last year. The appeal was filed on Tuesday evening, according to court documents and Maura Possley, a spokeswoman for the Attorney Generals Office.  The ruling, issued Tuesday by Judge Samuel Der-Yeghiayan of the Northern District of Illinois, resulted from a federal court lawsuit brought in August against the state law by a group aligned with a conservative think tank and came six weeks before the Nov. 8 election.[nL2N1C321W] The Chicago-based Liberty Justice Center, which filed the lawsuit, argued that the population threshold unconstitutionally discriminated against voters in less populated counties and boosted Democrats in heavily Democratic Cook County, where Chicago is located. In his ruling, Der-Yeghiayan wrote that the law provided an advantage to urban voters over their rural counterparts. The law, passed in late 2014 by the Democratic-led legislature and signed into law in early 2015 by former Democratic Governor Pat Quinn, allowed Election Day voter registration for the first time, including at polling places. But the section of the law regarding polling place registration pertained only to counties with populations of 100,000 or more. ",politicsNews,"September 28, 2016 ",1
White House calls Senate override of veto of September 11 bill 'embarrassing',"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday slammed the Senates nearly unanimous vote to reject President Barack Obamas veto of legislation allowing relatives of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to sue Saudi Arabias government. This is the single most embarrassing thing this United States Senate has done possibly since 1983, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters in a briefing, referring to the last time when the chamber so overwhelmingly overrode a presidents veto.  Earnest said some lawmakers had only recently been informed about potential drawbacks to approving the legislation. For those senators to then move forward in overriding the presidents veto that would prevent those negative consequences is an abdication of their basic responsibilities as elected representatives of the American people, he said.

Trump tries to soothe Polish-Americans' concerns about his NATO stance,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday sought to allay the concerns of Polish-Americans who questioned him about his commitment to Poland given his tough stance on NATO and talk of working with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump, at a small roundtable meeting with Polish-American leaders, heard their concerns about his demand that NATO nations bear more of the financial burden of their defense and his words of praise for Putin. As president I will honor Polands sacrifices for freedom. Were committed to a strong Poland, very committed, totally committed, and a strong Eastern Europe as a bulwark for freedom and security, Trump said. Trump has rattled NATO allies and many U.S. national security experts by saying that if elected on Nov. 8, he would demand that NATO members pay up their defense contributions of 2 percent of GDP or else have to pay for their own security. Many nations in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have lagged in their defense spending, to the frustration of U.S. leaders, but there has never been a move to cut them out of the U.S. security umbrella because of this. In Chicago, Trump hailed Poland as being up to date with its defense contributions. We want NATO to be strong which means we want more nations to follow the example of Poland, Trump said. If all made the same contributions as Poland, all our allies would be more secure. There are an estimated 9.5 million Americans of Polish descent in the United States, many of them clustered in Midwestern states that may play an important role in deciding who wins the election. Tim Kuzma, president of a group called the Polish Falcons of America, told Reuters that during the small roundtable event Trump was asked about whether he would be a strong friend to Poland. The message to Trump was Would a Trump administration support Poland? Kuzma said. Would a Trump administration honor the commitments to NATO? And he was very affirmative that he would and that he believes in a strong NATO. ",politicsNews,"September 28, 2016 ",1
Washington Post calls for Maine governor to resign,"BOSTON (Reuters) - The Washington Post on Wednesday called on Maine Governor Paul LePage to resign, following a series of incidents in which the two-term Republican made racially charged statements and threatened a Democratic lawmaker in an obscenity-laden email. LePage, whose term extends through 2018, last month lashed out at a state lawmaker who criticized his comments blaming black and Hispanic people from out of state for the heroin trade in Maine. In an editorial titled Maines unhinged governor, the newspaper wrote LePage threatens to remake his states image from a vacation paradise of surreal natural beauty to a hotbed of hatred. LePage had told reporters he had collected a three-ring binder of people arrested for trafficking drugs in the state and that 90 percent of those in it were black or Hispanic. The governor released the binder this week and a review by local media found that closer to one in three arrestees in it matched LePages description. Maine legislative leaders last month briefly considered convening a special session to reprimand LePage for the outburst, but the effort collapsed with the two parties unable to agree on whether they wanted to censure him or pursue impeachment. A spokeswoman for the governor dismissed the editorial as biased. The Post did not contact anyone from the governors office to fact-check this biased piece of propaganda, spokeswoman Adrienne Bennett said in an email. Clearly, the Post editorial board is exempt from reporting facts. Asked about what factual inaccuracies in the editorial concerned the governor, Bennett challenged the Posts description of LePage declining to attend a 2011 Martin Luther King Jr. Day event hosted by the states NAACP chapter, noting that he had instead attended a Rotary Club event honoring the slain civil rights activist. At the time that he declined the NAACPs invitation, in his first month as governor, LePage said that critics of his decision could kiss my butt. ",politicsNews,"September 28, 2016 ",1
Cuba welcomes ambassador nomination but says Obama can do more,"HAVANA (Reuters) - President Barack Obamas nomination of an ambassador to Cuba is welcome but he should still do more to normalize relations between the two countries during his remaining time in office, a senior Cuban government official said on Wednesday. Gustavo Machin, the deputy director for U.S. affairs in the Cuban foreign ministry, told a news conference that Cuba will make those concerns known during a bilateral commission meeting on Friday in Washington. The Cuban delegation will point out the lack of advances of in the economic, commercial sphere, Machin said. We consider the measures adopted by President Obamas administration are positive but still insufficient and limited. Obama on Tuesday nominated career diplomat Jeffrey DeLaurentis, the top official at the U.S. Embassy in Havana since relations were restored last year, to be the first U.S. ambassador to Cuba in more than five decades. This was welcome news, Machin said. Cuba appointed its ambassador to the U.S. a year ago.  Still, the nomination must be approved by the Republican-controlled Senate, which is seen as a long shot in a presidential election year and given expected strong resistance from Cuban-American senators including Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas. Obama should also use his executive powers, as he has done in the past, to further hollow out the trade embargo imposed on Cuba after its 1959 revolution, Machin said. Only Congress can lift the embargo, and the Republican leadership is not expected to allow such a move anytime soon. If the president could... allow investment in telecoms, why cant he authorize investments in other areas? Machin said.  If he allowed the export of certain Cuban products to the United States, why could he not broaden the export of Cuban products? Machin asked. Obamas critics meanwhile accuse him of already making too many concessions towards Cuba without getting enough in return. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said earlier this month that if elected he would seek to reverse the detente unless the leaders there allowed religious freedoms and freed political prisoners. Machin said he hoped the next president would take into account the opinion of the majority of Americans, who agree with the opening to Cuba, according to opinion polls.  Despite the need for more progress still, the two countries have made concrete progress in improving relations over the past four months since a previous commission meeting, Machin said, for example re-launching commercial flights.

Bridgegate testimony could cut Christie's last political lifeline,"(Reuters) - Testimony by a former ally of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie that the Republican knew about the Bridgegate traffic scandal as it was going on could endanger his best chance at a political future: a role in a Trump administration. Christie has denied claims he had been an active participant in the plan to deliberately create massive traffic jams on a key bridge to New York to punish a Democratic mayors refusal to endorse his re-election bid. But each piece of evidence that ties Christie closer to the scandal makes him more of a liability for Republican presidential contender Donald Trump, a New York real estate developer who has tapped the governor to head his transition team. Every revelation increases the odds that Trump will distance himself from Christie, especially as Election Day gets closer, said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at New Jerseys Princeton University. Christie still serves a value to Trump, who wants to compete in blue states, he added. But there will be a point where the revelations overwhelm any sense of loyalty or any perception that he remains valuable to the campaign. A Trump campaign spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The 53-year-old governors political future is already limited. New Jersey law prevents him from running for a third consecutive term next year, and polls show that Bridgegate has seriously hurt his popularity, explaining in part why Christie, who hoped to be president, quickly tied his fortunes to Trump. Christie on Tuesday repeated that he had not known about the lane-closure plan.  Theres all kinds of stuff going on up in a courtroom in Newark, and I want to be really clear to all of you about something, Christie told reporters in Trenton. I had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments. That contradicted the testimony of David Wildstein, a former executive at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, in a federal court in Newark, where two other ex-Christie allies face criminal charges for their role in the scandal. While Bridget Kelly, his former deputy chief of staff and Bill Baroni, a close associate and former executive at the Port Authority, are on trial for their role in the 2013 incident, Christie himself has not been charged criminally. The governor was at the peak of his popularity at the time, having stepped into the national spotlight when he toured  Superstorm Sandy-ravaged New Jersey shore with President Barack Obama. With his eye on the White House, he was eager to secure the endorsements of Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich and other Democratic mayors to show he was a politician able to forge alliances across party lines. The lane closures, which generated massive traffic jams at the George Washington Bridge and national headlines, took a heavy toll on Christies image and drew the mockery of the states favorite son, rock star Bruce Springsteen. A Rutgers-Eagleton poll conducted early this month found that 23 percent of state residents held a favorable view of Christie, down 7 percentage points from a year earlier and one-third of what it was at Christies peak of popularity in February 2013. Bridgegate almost wholly contributed to the downfall that weve seen for the governor, said Ashley Koning, director of the Eagleton Centerfor Public Interest Polling at New Jerseys Rutgers University. His low popularity makes it highly unlikely hed be successful in another statewide run, whether it was for governor in 2021 or for another office, she said. After Christies bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination failed, he pivoted quickly to endorse Trump, who embraced his support and named him transition chair in May. Christie would be charged with helping build a cabinet for a Trump White House and serve as a liaison with the outgoing Obama team.  Christie was a federal prosecutor in New Jersey, suggesting the likeliest job in a Trump cabinet would be attorney general. Its hard to imagine that he would be able to win Senate confirmation with knowledge of this scheme confirmed, said Brigid Callahan Harrison, professor of political science and law at New Jerseys Montclair State University.  Trump could also pick Christie for a staff role, she said. Bill Stepien, who managed both of Christies gubernatorial runs, is an adviser to the Trump campaign. Harrison added: From what we know of Trump, he may not be overly cautious about affiliating himself with people that could be damaging. ",politicsNews,"September 28, 2016 ",1
Clinton seeks to keep Trump on defensive after presidential debate,"RALEIGH, N.C. (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton sought on Tuesday to keep Republican rival Donald Trump on the defensive a day after their first U.S. presidential debate with accusations he is a sexist, racist and tax dodger, while Trump suggested he would hit her harder next time by bringing up her husbands infidelity. While the New York real estate mogul found himself in another controversy over his fresh insults about the weight of a former beauty pageant winner, Clinton tried to keep up the momentum after her forceful debate performance. She told reporters that during the debate, Trump was making charges and claims that were demonstrably untrue, offering opinions that I think a lot of people would find offensive and off-putting. For his part, Trump, speaking at a rally in the battleground state of Florida on Tuesday, said of the debate: On issue after issue, Secretary Clinton defended the terrible status quo  while I laid out our plan to bring jobs, security and prosperity back to the American people. Monday nights face-off between Clinton, with decades of experience in public life, and Trump, famous as a television personality but running for office for the first time, attracted a record audience for a U.S. presidential debate. Nielsen data showed 84 million people watched the debate on U.S. television, topping the 80.6 million viewers for the Jimmy Carter-Ronald Reagan TV presidential debate in 1980.  Trump praised himself for not attacking Clinton during the debate about the marital infidelity of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, but said he may take up the attack line going forward. There are two more debates scheduled, on Oct. 9 in St. Louis and Oct. 19 in Las Vegas, ahead of the Nov. 8 election. I may hit her harder in certain ways. I really eased up because I didnt want to hurt anybodys feelings, Trump said in an interview on the Fox News program Fox & Friends. He added that when Clinton criticized him for his treatment of women, he held back, saying: I was going to hit her with her husbands women. And I decided I shouldnt do it because her daughter was in the room. Clinton brushed off Trumps vow, saying: He can run his campaign however he chooses. She added that the real point is about temperament and fitness and qualification to hold the most important, hardest job in the world. Trump himself was still married to his first wife, Ivana Trump, when he had a high-profile affair with Marla Maples, who became his second wife. He eventually divorced Maples and married his third and current wife, Melania Trump. In the interview with Fox News, Trump sought to deflect criticism of his debate performance, saying the debate moderator, Lester Holt of NBC News, asked him very unfair questions and that he was given a very bad microphone. I dont want to believe in conspiracy theories, of course, but it was much lower than hers and it was crackling, Trump said of the microphone.  Clinton, speaking to reporters on her campaign plane, said: Anyone who complains about the microphone is not having a good night. Clinton, 68, excoriated Trump, 70, during the debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, for having called women pigs, slobs and dogs. But Trump leveled new and highly personal criticism on Tuesday toward Venezuelan-born beauty queen Alicia Machado, who won the 1996 Miss Universe title and is now a U.S. citizen. She was the winner and she gained a massive amount of weight, said Trump, the former owner of the Miss Universe pageants. And it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that - her attitude - and we had a real problem with her. Clinton, the first woman to win the presidential nomination of a major U.S. political party, seemed to pique Trump when she brought up during the debate how Trump had insulted women, mentioning Machado by name. Clinton said Trump called her Miss Piggy and also Miss Housekeeping because she was a Latina. Clinton, a former U.S. senator and secretary of state, stepped up her criticism of Trump for refusing to release his tax returns, as presidential candidates have done for decades, and for saying during the debate that not paying federal income tax makes me smart. He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share of taxes. In fact, I think theres a strong probability he hasnt paid federal taxes a lot of years, she said at a campaign rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, a pivotal state in the election. He probably hasnt paid a penny to support our troops or our vets or our schools or our healthcare system. Trump held a campaign event in Miamis Little Havana, aiming to shore up support among Hispanic voters. His campaign said on Tuesday it had raised more than $18 million since the debate. Trump earlier complained that issues from Clintons 2009-2013 tenure as secretary of state were not addressed on Monday night, including topics such as her use of a private computer server for government emails, the deadly attack in Benghazi, Libya, and the Clinton Foundation charity. In one of their more heated exchanges, Clinton accused Trump of promulgating a racist lie by questioning the citizenship of Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, saying he was not born in the United States. Obama lent his support again to Clintons bid to become his successor, tweeting on Tuesday: Couldnt be more proud of @HillaryClinton. Her vision and command during last nights debate showed that shes ready to be our next @POTUS. The Washington Post, citing a Clinton campaign source, reported she would be endorsed by John Warner, a former Republican U.S. senator from Virginia and Navy secretary, who the newspaper said would appear at an event in Virginia on Wednesday with Clintons running mate, Tim Kaine. The Arizona Republics editorial board also endorsed Clinton, the first time in the newspapers 126-year history it has backed a Democrat for president. ",politicsNews,"September 26, 2016 ",1
Trump-Clinton showdown breaks TV debate ratings record as 84 million watch,"NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The first presidential debate between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump drew 84 million U.S. television viewers, a record for such an event and numbers rarely seen on TV in the age of digital streaming and social media. The audience for the Monday night face-off beat the 1980 record of 80.6 million set by the Jimmy Carter-Ronald Reagan presidential debate, when viewers had far fewer entertainment options. But it fell short of the 100 million viewers some analysts had predicted. The estimated ratings figure from Nielsen included people who watched the raucous encounter across 13 U.S. cable and broadcast networks and public television station PBS.  The TV figures did not include millions of people who watched the debate online through Twitter (TWTR.N), Facebook (FB.O) and other social media, including in large groups in bars and restaurants. Alphabet Incs (GOOGL.O) YouTube reported nearly 2 million live concurrent streams of the debate on its platform. The National Football Leagues annual Super Bowl attracts more than 100 million viewers, making it the biggest U.S. TV event.  Mondays debate was the first of three scheduled between Clinton and Trump before the Nov. 8 election. The other two are set for Oct. 9 and 19. Fox News Channel (FOXA.O) grabbed the biggest cable audience with an average 11.4 million viewers, early Nielsen data showed. NBC CMSCA.O, whose Nightly News anchor Lester Holt moderated the contentious exchanges about race, the economy and national security, was first overall with an estimated audience of 18.2 million. TV networks had promoted the debates for days beforehand and reported strong demand compared with four years ago for commercial time during pre- and post-debate programming. Ad rates were far higher than for typical news programming. CNN (TWX.N) charged more than $55,000 for 30-second ad spots as part of packages ranging from $800,000 to $1 million that included future debates and election night, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  CBS (CBS.N) charged between $200,000 to $225,000, according to another source.   Both CNN and CBS have limited availability left for the next debate on Oct. 9, the sources said.  Clearly the debate did really well last night, said Michael Law, managing director of video investments at Dentsu Aegis Network. Law said he did not expect ad rates for the next debate would rise significantly based on Monday nights audience. The Oct. 9 face-off airs against an NFL matchup of two popular teams - the Green Bay Packers and New York Giants. The NFL will likely do well on that night, but will probably see some fall-off during the 90 minutes of debate, Law said. ",politicsNews,"September 27, 2016 ",1
"Factbox: Clinton's policies on economy, Islamic State, other issues","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has pledged to raise taxes on the wealthy, preserve the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and provide a path to citizenship for undocumented workers.	 Here are the proposals the former secretary of state has made as part of her argument that she is best qualified to occupy the Oval Office: Clinton has said the rich, not the middle class, would see their taxes go up. She supports billionaire investor Warren Buffetts eponymous tax proposal calling for those making more than $1 million a year to pay an effective tax rate of 30 percent. Clinton has also called for an additional 4 percent tax on those making more than $5 million annually. Clinton has pledged to raise the estate tax levied on property transferred from a deceased person to their heirs. She also supports a tiered inheritance tax structure, with a top rate of 65 percent on the wealthiest estates of more than $500 million for a single person or $1 billion for a couple. Clinton has pledged to unveil a plan to rebuild U.S. infrastructure during her first 100 days, saying this would create new jobs. She would use some of the revenue generated from her tax plan to pay for making community colleges tuition-free and ensuring students can graduate from public colleges and universities without incurring debt. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group that independently scored Clintons proposals in their totality, estimated her policies would cost $1.8 trillion over the next decade and would be offset by $1.6 trillion, mostly generated by taxing high earners. The group said the remaining $200 billion could be covered by $275 billion in corporate tax revenue the Clinton campaign has called for but not yet spelled out in sufficient detail for them to credit as an offset at this time. Clinton has promised to propose broad legislation within her first 100 days in office to overhaul the immigration system and establish a process for undocumented workers to become citizens. Clinton has said she will defend executive actions taken by Democratic President Barack Obama to defer deportations of children brought illegally to the United States and the parents of children who are citizens or legal residents. She has said if Congress does not pass comprehensive immigration reform, she will similarly use executive action to defer deportations in sympathetic cases. A federal court has ruled that Obama did not have the authority to issue his executive orders on immigration, known as DACA and DAPA. The U.S. Supreme Court, currently short one member, split 4-to-4 on whether to hear the administrations appeal, leaving the lower courts ruling in place for the time being. Clinton has promised to preserve the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted after the financial crisis, and to pursue further measures to toughen Wall Street regulations. She has proposed a fee for large financial institutions based on their size and the level of risk they pose. She would also give regulators additional authority to force institutions that pose high risks to break apart or reorganize. Clinton has also urged strengthening the Volcker Rule, which restricts proprietary trading by commercial banks. She has called for a new tax on high-frequency trading and for stricter oversight of hedge funds, private equity firms and other players in the so-called shadow-banking system. She has promised stiffer policies on people who commit financial crimes, including an extension of the statute of limitations on such crimes and a requirement for bank executives to return bonuses if their institutions suffer major losses. Changes to Dodd-Frank have stalled in the Republican-controlled Congress, and it is unclear whether Clinton could get congressional backing to strengthen the law, unless Democrats win control of one or both chambers in the Nov. 8 election. Clinton has pledged to defeat Islamic State and has said the first step to fighting the militant group is to eliminate its strongholds in Iraq and Syria. In a departure from the Obama administration, she supports the establishment of a no-fly zone over Syria and has called for an intensified air campaign by the U.S.-led coalition. Clinton has said she would send additional American special forces to help Arab and Kurdish forces already on the ground. She opposes sending additional U.S. ground troops to the region. Clinton has said the United States and European allies must share intelligence more effectively in order to thwart potential attacks. She has urged Silicon Valley companies to work with the government to track militant recruitment tactics on the internet.  Current and former Obama administration officials have told Reuters they believe Clinton would  take a harder line on Russia than either Obama or Trump. Clinton has said she believes Russian hackers are behind the breach of Democratic Party systems in an attempt to influence the U.S. presidential election. Clinton has said Russia should play a role in combating Islamic State in Syria, and her foreign policy adviser has said she would consider arming government forces in Ukraine, one of Russias neighbors, in a move to combat Russian aggression in Europe. Russia has backed ethic Russian separatists in Ukraine. Clinton was a key player in Obamas pivot to Asia when she served as his secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Clinton has said she will aggressively pursue trade cases and impose consequences against China when it commits trade abuses. She opposes granting China market-economy status, which China will be seeking when a World Trade Organization clause expires in December, and has said she would make sure a newly installed trade prosecutor would ensure that China is playing by the rules. Clinton has said she would treat cyber attacks from countries such as Russia and China like any other attack and that the United States will be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.

"Factbox: Trump's policies on immigration, economy, other issues","(Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump wants to build a wall on the border with Mexico, boost spending on the military and slap trade tariffs on China. Here are those positions and others the real estate developer, who has never held elective office, has put forward to convince the American people that he should be the next U.S. chief executive: Trump has proposed collapsing the current seven income tax brackets to three with rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent. The current top rate is 39.6 percent. He also would eliminatethe estate tax, and slash the corporate rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. His plan would allow families to deduct childcare costs from income taxes and offer further support through an existing tax credit for lower-income people. He would also provide six weeks of paid maternity leave for new mothers through temporary unemployment insurance. He has proposed paying for it by cracking down on fraud in the unemployment insurance program and through other changes to the system. Trump has proposed increasing spending on the U.S. military and infrastructure but says he would reduce spending on other categories by 1 percent each year. However, the Social Security and Medicare programs for the elderly would be exempt from cuts. Some economists questioned whether Trumps ideas for reducing spending would be enough to make up for major tax cuts, particularly since many Republicans believe Medicare and Social Security must be revamped to control government outlays. Trump launched his presidential campaign with his vow to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and has said he would insist that the United States southern neighbor pay for it. He has promised to triple the number of immigration enforcement officers, hire more Border Patrol agents and boost penalties for overstaying visas. Trump has said he would prioritize the deportation of people in the United States illegally who have committed crimes and of those who have arrived recently or overstayed visas. He would require people seeking legal status to leave and reapply. Trump said that after his immigration goals are achieved, he would determine what to do about people still in the country illegally.  Trump has proposed ideological screening, or extreme vetting, of people coming to the United States to determine whether they share American values. He has proposed a banon immigration from countries where vetting would be difficult. Initially, he proposed a temporary ban on all Muslims from entering the United States. Critics, including some of Trumps defeated rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, said the initial plan to ban all Muslims was discriminatory and likely unconstitutional. Others have since said his extreme vetting idea might not be feasible.  Trump has promised a dismantling of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted following the financial crisis, but has given few details.  The Republican Partys platform calls for reinstating Glass-Steagall, the 1930s-era law that forced the separation of investment banks from deposit-taking institutions. Trumps former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, said in July that his campaign backed this change. Republican lawmakers have so far been unable to undo many of their most-despised pieces of the Dodd-Frank law, and many in their ranks oppose a return to Glass-Steagall. Trump has offered few details about his plans to combat Islamic State but has said he would knock the hell out of the militant group. He says he is keeping the details of strategy a secret so as not to disclose them to the enemy. Trump has said if he wins, he would give U.S. generals 30 days after he takes office on Jan. 20, 2017 to propose their own plans.  Trump has said he opposes accepting refugees fleeing violence in Syria, and instead has said he would create safe zones there, which he says would be funded by Gulf states. President Barack Obama has said a safe zone in Syria would require a large U.S. military commitment, something unlikely to be popular with Americans weary of lengthy wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Trump has said he would have a very, very good relationship with Russia. He has said he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was a better leader than Obama.  Trump has said could work with Russia to combat Islamic State. He also said he would look into recognizing Crimea, seized from Ukraine in 2014, as Russian territory and lifting sanctions on Russia imposed by Western nations for what they called an illegal land grab.  Trump has criticized the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, saying some U.S. allies have not met their defense commitments. In July, he said if Russia attacked a NATO member, he would consider whether the country has paid up before providing defense. NATO leaders say the sanctions against Russia are key to persuading it to change that countrys behavior in Ukraine, where it has backed ethnic Russian separatists, and that the alliance has long been focused on fighting international terrorism.  Trump has made criticism of Chinas trade practices a central campaign theme. He has vowed to formally label China a currency manipulator, impose tariffs on Chinese imports and bring unfair trade cases as punishment for what he believes are improper subsidies.  Trump has called for a stronger U.S. military presence in the South China Sea.  He has said he would pull the United States out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. Though the trade agreement does not include China, Trump has said he is concerned it could try to enter it through the back door. TPP supporters, including Obama, have said China hoped to reach its own deal that would make it the leader in Asian trade. They have said the pact would enable the United States to take a leadership role in the region instead of China. ",politicsNews,"September 27, 2016 ",1
U.S. Senate's top tax lawmaker targets corporate offshore profits,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senates senior Democratic tax law writer says he will rip up a root of corporate tax avoidance if his party wins Senate control in November, targeting trillions of dollars in tax-deferred profits being held abroad by U.S. companies. In an interview with Reuters, Oregon Senator Ron Wyden   said he wants to put an end to a Kennedy-era law that lets U.S. corporations indefinitely hold profits from active business operations offshore without paying U.S. tax on them.  Corporate tax avoidance is under trans-Atlantic assault. The EU has slapped a $14.5 billion back-taxes bill on Apple Inc. Ten days ago, the Obama administration imposed another in a series of recent clamp-downs on tax avoidance. The idea of ending tax deferral of foreign profits has been kicked around for years. Wyden, 67, is a long-time proponent and might finally be able to do something about it, if voters support enough Senate Democrats in the Nov. 8 elections. This is going to be front and center at the beginning of January, said Wyden, who is the top Democrat on the tax law-writing Senate Finance Committee. The panel and the full Senate are presently controlled by Republicans. Wyden said his first action, if he becomes chairman, will be to propose a funding package to upgrade U.S. infrastructure. It would require U.S. companies to bring home more than $2 trillion in foreign profits held offshore as part of an international tax reform package. A previous tax holiday for profits held offshore was tried in 2004 but was voluntary, not mandatory. Under that program, $360 billion in foreign profits was repatriated at a discounted tax rate of 5.25 percent, far below the statutory corporate income tax rate of 35 percent. Wyden has not specified a rate for his proposal. Six years later, with corporations pushing for another such holiday, a congressional committee said the 2004 program had little economic impact and cost the U.S. Treasury about $3.3 billion in lost revenue.  The tax reforms Wyden envisions would also lower corporate tax rates and simplify the convoluted U.S. tax code to prevent tax planners from gaming the system. The code has not been thoroughly overhauled in 30 years. The first bill out of the gate would be roads and bridges and transportation, Wyden told Reuters on Friday. My sense is that there will be an interest among members in using a portion of the money derived from international reform for the roads and bridges and transportation systems. Most multinationals and many lawmakers, both Republicans and some Democrats, favor a foreign profit repatriation program, but not like the one Wyden wants.  The United States has a worldwide corporate income tax system that taxes profits of U.S. companies no matter where they are made, with some exceptions. One is that earnings from active business operations, as opposed to passive income such as rent or royalties, can be left offshore on a tax-free basis under the Kennedy-era deferral rule. Passive income is taxed. In contrast, most large countries have territorial systems in which companies pay income tax only to the government of the country where the profits were made. Corporate America has been lobbying for many years for a territorial system that would make deferral obsolete. Wyden and other Democrats want to keep a worldwide system and eliminate deferral, a position singled out for criticism last week by House Speaker Paul Ryan.  The fear I have is the progressives who kind of control the Democratic Party dont think anything close to what looks like tax reform is a good thing, Ryan told the Economic Club of New York. I hope that view changes. But Wyden says the public is unlikely to accept a system under which U.S. corporations do not pay taxes on foreign profits. At a time when Americans are so angry about jobs being shipped overseas... I dont think its going to go over very well, he said. A competitive rate, no deferral and no gaming, Im going to argue gets you the benefit of territorial. Some Republicans also oppose tying tax reform to infrastructure. Wyden says failing to reform the tax code could strain U.S. relations with the European Union, if EU state aid probes continue to penalize U.S. companies, possibly resulting in U.S. action before the World Trade Organization. To Democrats and Republicans, this feels more like the European Commission declaring open season on the American tax base than (them) joining us to fight tax dodgers, he said. I could see members saying the United States should respond with a WTO case, Wyden added. Theres that kind of anger. ",politicsNews,"September 27, 2016 ",1
FBI probes hacks targeting phones of Democratic Party officials: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI is investigating suspected attempts to hack mobile phones used by Democratic Party officials as recently as the past month, four people with direct knowledge of the attack and the investigation told Reuters. The revelation underscores the widening scope of the U.S. criminal inquiry into cyber attacks on Democratic Party organizations, including the presidential campaign of its  candidate, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. U.S. officials have said they believe those attacks were orchestrated by hackers backed by the Russian government, possibly to disrupt the Nov. 8 election in which Clinton faces Republican Party candidate Donald Trump. Russia has dismissed allegations it was involved in cyber attacks on the organizations. The more recent attempted phone hacking also appears to have been conducted by Russian-backed hackers, two people with knowledge of the situation said. Federal Bureau of Investigation representatives had no immediate comment, and a Clinton campaign spokesman said they were unaware of the suspected phone hacking. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) did not respond to a request for comment. An official of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) said that nobody at the organization had been contacted by investigators about possible phone hacking. Interim DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile told CNN: Our struggle with the Russian hackers that we announced in June is ongoing - as we knew it would be - and we are choosing not to provide general updates unless personal data or other sensitive information has been accessed or stolen. FBI agents had approached a small number of Democratic Party officials to discuss concerns their mobile phones may have been compromised by hackers, people involved said. It was not clear how many people were targeted by the hack or whether they included members of Congress, a possibility that could raise additional security concerns for U.S. officials. If they were successful, hackers could have been able to acquire a wide range of data from targeted cellphones, including call data, text messages, emails, photos and contact lists, one person with knowledge of the situation said. In a sense, your phone is your office brain, said Bruce Schneier, a cyber security expert with Resilient, an IBM company, which is not involved in the investigation. Its incredibly intimate. Anything thats on your phone, if your phone is hacked, the hacker can get it. The FBI has asked some of those whose phones were believed to have hacked to turn over their phones so that investigators could image them, creating a copy of the device and related data. U.S. investigators are looking into whether hackers used data stolen from servers run by Democratic organizations or the private emails of their employees to get access to cellphones, one person said. Hackers previously targeted servers used by the DNC, the body that sets strategy for the party, and the DCCC, which raises money for Democrats running for seats in the House of Representatives, officials have said.  Clinton said during Mondays presidential debate there was no doubt Russia has sponsored hacks against all kinds of organizations in our country and mentioned Russian President Vladimir Putin by name. Putin is playing a really tough, long game here. And one of the things hes done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee, Clinton said. Trump countered that there was no definitive proof that Russia had sponsored the hacks of Democratic organizations. I dont think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC, he said. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. ",politicsNews,"September 27, 2016 ",1
